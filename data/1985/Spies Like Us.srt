1
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:11,232
I have a package from
the nat-sat printing room.

2
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,359
Say it a little louder.

3
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:16,196
Open the window.
Shout it to Moscow.

4
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:17,447
Sorry. I...

5
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:20,283
It's not your fault you're stupid.

6
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:24,787
- Open it and get out.
- It's chained to my wrist.

7
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:26,789
Security has the key.

8
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:33,963
Leave the material,
take the case, and wait outside.

9
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:37,926
No can do, sir.
The material's locked inside.

10
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:40,386
Just give it to me.

11
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:50,395
Get in the closet.

12
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:12,793
Hi-weather transmitted
this an hour ago.

13
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:15,337
Beautiful close-ups!

14
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:17,965
Miegs and Sline will drool.

15
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:21,635
They're late again.
Unusual for soldiers.

16
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:23,804
They know what they're doing.

17
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:30,727
- Gentlemen.
- Here they are.

18
00:06:31,854 --> 00:06:35,774
- Are those from the latest fly-by?
Over here, general.

19
00:06:40,238 --> 00:06:43,532
Wait.
Is someone in this closet?

20
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,577
- Ignore him.
- He's one of our couriers.

21
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:49,830
Okay.

22
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:54,459
Nice close-ups.
Definitely approaching full-go hour.

23
00:06:57,171 --> 00:07:00,882
I greased the House Committee
for covert appropriations.

24
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:04,011
They think the funds are
for more stealth bombers.

25
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:08,890
We've selected two GLG-20s.
They're the best men we have.

26
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,101
The last two were the best men we had.

27
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,854
Now they're the two best dead men
we have.

28
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:17,858
I'm convinced there's a security leak
in your training program.

29
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:22,613
- We could bypass training.
- No. They'll go through training.

30
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:25,115
But with four other GLG-20s...

31
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:28,702
...two who are responsible
for the project and two who are...

32
00:07:29,203 --> 00:07:30,871
...disposable.

33
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,082
Are you suggesting we assign this job
to inferior personnel?

34
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:37,461
No, I understand.
Two teams.

35
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,882
One to do the job,
the other to be a diversion.

36
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:45,843
- You mean decoys? Targets?
- Exactly.

37
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:50,890
GLG-20s don't grow exactly on trees.
I'd hate to waste two as targets.

38
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:54,894
I'm sure you can find a couple
of men you won't mind wasting.

39
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:53,285
What?

40
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,169
- What?
- Aren't you taking this test tomorrow?

41
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:06,424
- The Foreign Service Board? Yeah.
- Don't you have to study?

42
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:10,970
No. Are you kidding?
I know the FSB exam backwards.

43
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:15,516
- I've taken it three times already.
- It's supposed to be all different this year.

44
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:19,979
- Five hundred questions in two hours.
- Let me see the booklet.

45
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:27,236
Look at these samples.
All multiple choice. It's easy.

46
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:30,656
Here.

47
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:35,453
"If discovered appropriating classified
documents at a foreign consulate reception...

48
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,497
...you should
A, express concern.

49
00:09:38,707 --> 00:09:40,875
B, act surprised.

50
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:42,668
C, deny everything...

51
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:46,838
...and D, all three. "
The answer is D, all three.

52
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:48,465
Common sense.

53
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:51,301
I guess you don't want advancement
bad enough.

54
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,847
My granddad was an envoy.
My dad was an envoy.

55
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,725
I was born into the trade.

56
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:03,438
Besides, I've arranged for an
intimate lunch with our supervisor.

57
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:06,357
Fitz, you have to take the test.

58
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,444
I'm very hurt that's why you invited me
over here today.

59
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:12,113
Don't do that, Alice.

60
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,118
I'm sorry, I'm not myself today.
I saw my neurologist this morning.

61
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:20,497
You're not gonna give me
some bullshit that you're dying, are you?

62
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,540
No...

63
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,709
...not now.

64
00:11:10,923 --> 00:11:12,131
Millbarge.

65
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:19,722
- Where's the brain for the Scramjam 7000?
- Procurement picked it up over an hour ago.

66
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:20,932
Was it fixed?

67
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,059
Yeah, new voice scramblers
and everything.

68
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:26,396
Huh. What about that
Chinese radio chatter?

69
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:27,605
It's done.

70
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,026
- Here you go.
- Done?

71
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:37,240
It was a static-filled, triple-scrambled
microwave transmission...

72
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:39,784
...between two soldiers
talking in Mandarin Chinese.

73
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:43,580
The Chinese were only using a simple
polyphonetically grouped 20-digit key...

74
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:46,874
...transposed in boustrophendonic form
with multiple nulls.

75
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,584
I broke it with this.

76
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,628
A Drogan's decoder wheel?

77
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:54,464
They put these in cereal boxes
for kids.

78
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:58,343
Yeah, I found it in a box
of Lucky Charms.

79
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,973
- Break it down again with the machines!
- I already did.

80
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:09,104
Then clean up the desk!

81
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,321
Good. That's much better.

82
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:20,824
By the way, good luck
on the test tomorrow.

83
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:25,370
- What test?
- Foreign Service Board exams. Good luck.

84
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,832
Foreign Service Boards, tomorrow?
I can't take that test tomorrow.

85
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,834
I haven't studied. I'm not prepared.

86
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,754
You were bumped up on the list.

87
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:38,425
You're scheduled for tomorrow
morning. I'm sure I told you.

88
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:41,595
This is dated two weeks ago.

89
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:43,889
You planned this.

90
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,767
You want me to fail that test
so you can keep me...

91
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:50,020
...down here in the center of the earth
doing your work for you.

92
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:51,980
Watch your mouth, mister.

93
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,734
This department's laying off
civilians left and right.

94
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:02,366
- Where you going?
- Home. To study.

95
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:07,037
Ha. One night studying for
a grade-19 FSB exam?

96
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,831
- Good luck.
- Listen, captain.

97
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:14,044
I'm going to pass that exam,
and I'm going to get out of this hole...

98
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:17,547
...and do some really important work
for national security.

99
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,216
Yeah, sure.

100
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:23,679
I was going to do your family a favor
and hook up the Disney Channel...

101
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:27,057
...for free. Well, forget it.

102
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:30,894
Ladies and gentlemen...

103
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:34,481
...as of this afternoon, the undersecretary
for South American affairs...

104
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,942
...emphatically denies
any and all intervention...

105
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,737
...in the current realignment of top positions
of the Paraguayan Air Force.

106
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,447
Thank you very much.

107
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:46,576
What about the Paraguayan army's request
for spraying subsidies?

108
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:50,496
Are there any Paraguayans here?
No?

109
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:56,002
Their request for subsidies
was not Paraguayan, as it were.

110
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,964
The United States would never...
The president, our president, had not.

111
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,925
As far as I know, that's how
it'll always be. Is that clear?

112
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,762
How can you say we aren't
spending millions on spraying...

113
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:09,432
...when the International
Wheat Board has reported...

114
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:13,394
...and I quote, "Extensive contamination
in the Argentine grain fields"?

115
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,397
The State... Ever...

116
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:17,898
Microphones...

117
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,110
...cutting out on us.
I'm sorry. However...

118
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,739
Lunch date, so I must go.

119
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:33,372
These examinations
are qualifiers for positions...

120
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:37,001
...in the intelligence sections
of our embassies overseas.

121
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:42,465
The nature of your postings
will be secret.

122
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,927
Now, secret work can be very risky.

123
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,972
I cite as an example what happened to
a great American...

124
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,640
Not yet!

125
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,853
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

126
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,563
My fault.

127
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,155
Mm...

128
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,283
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to attend the reading of a will.

129
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:15,289
I had to stay to the very end.
I found out I received nothing.

130
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,333
Broke my arm.

131
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,842
Would you hold my wallet
while I take the test please?

132
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,886
There's $1,000 in there...

133
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,890
...or maybe there isn't.
Know what I mean?

134
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,310
Are you saying I can take this money
if I help you pass the test?

135
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,021
What do you think?

136
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,777
Thank you.

137
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,448
- Where do I...?
- Sit down!

138
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,050
You may begin...

139
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,635
...now.

140
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,410
Excuse me.

141
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:38,949
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

142
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,998
Oh, God, the pressure!
I can't take it!

143
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,838
I can't take it! I can't!
I can't do it!

144
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:03,140
I can't... What page?

145
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:06,893
This is Emmett Fitz-Hume.

146
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:10,022
He's an information
officer at State.

147
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:12,649
He started there in '74 as a mail boy.

148
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,860
His father got him his job.

149
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,946
This is Austin Millbarge.

150
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:22,659
He's a repair supervisor in DIA's
code-breaking arm at the Pentagon.

151
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:26,747
Wiggled into supervisor's pay
through an F-section.

152
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:30,667
His last job before joining Defense
was fixing office copiers.

153
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:34,838
He's good with hardware,
got some Russian.

154
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,465
Want to see their test scores?

155
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:38,508
What the hell for?

156
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:41,720
They're a couple of absolutely
self-involved bullshit artists...

157
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:45,557
...who got caught cheating
on a departmental exam.

158
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,893
They'll do anything
to save their jobs.

159
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:50,437
One's got basic diplomacy skills.

160
00:19:50,646 --> 00:19:54,106
The other's a code-breaker
with language ability.

161
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:56,400
I believe we've found our decoys.

162
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:02,865
Uhn. Heart attack!

163
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,578
Can I borrow your pen?

164
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:09,872
All right, everybody,
please stand back!

165
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,335
I'm a trained cardiovascular
respiratory emergency assist technician.

166
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:19,465
Stand back! This man needs air!
All of you should leave the room...

167
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:21,884
Well?

168
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,931
So, what are we gonna get?
Dismissal? Suspension?

169
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,809
Censure? Departmental prosecution?
What?

170
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:31,602
Promotion.

171
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:34,021
- What?
- That's right.

172
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,941
We like what we've seen of you two.

173
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,902
We're bucking you
right up to gathering.

174
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:41,195
Level 20.

175
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:46,158
Gathering, level 20?
That's quite a step up in base pay.

176
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:47,535
We're not in trouble?

177
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:50,037
We're not recruiting
for the Boy Scouts.

178
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:52,540
We want people who are aggressive...

179
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:57,169
...who know how to go after that
little edge that you need to survive.

180
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:02,925
We especially liked the way you guys
were working as a team in there.

181
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:10,182
Now, if you feel you can work together,
you're on your way up.

182
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:15,438
We've got a very special assignment
for you two.

183
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:19,525
- Foreign service?
- Yes.

184
00:21:19,693 --> 00:21:22,194
- Undercover work?
- Yes.

185
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:27,366
- Emmett Fitz-Hume.
- Austin Millbarge.

186
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:30,286
- When do we begin our training?
- Right away.

187
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:32,121
Boy!

188
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,049
We're just hitching a ride.
They won't make us jump.

189
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:47,803
Jump? No chance.
We won't have to jump.

190
00:21:49,347 --> 00:21:52,933
All right, Sky-troopers!
Let's go! Let's go!

191
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:55,393
Go?
What does he mean, go?

192
00:21:55,895 --> 00:22:00,565
Come on, come on. You can't do this!
What are you doing?

193
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:02,567
Fitz-Hume!

194
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:16,789
Help! Help!

195
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:53,284
- Where are we?
- I don't know. I wasn't watching.

196
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,537
I lost everything at 7,000 feet.

197
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,459
- You hear that?
- Yeah. It's a dickfer.

198
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:03,795
- What's a dickfer?
- To pee with.

199
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:10,468
Was that me?

200
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:31,489
- We need a plan.
- Let's play dead.

201
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:41,207
- Come on, superspy, think of something.
- You're the diplomat. Talk to them.

202
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:48,339
All right.

203
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,677
Stop right there,
and I'll bring back the sun.

204
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,179
Okay?

205
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,057
This is my sister.
You can all have her.

206
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:00,976
I hear she's very good.

207
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:04,563
- One more step, I swing!
- He's threatening you!

208
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:06,023
Let's get him!

209
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:09,901
- Show some balls!
- It's too late to try to impress them.

210
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:13,155
That's enough.

211
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:22,789
- Austin Millbarge?
- Here, sir.

212
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,167
Emmett Fitz-Hume.

213
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:27,085
Hello.

214
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:31,465
Sir.

215
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:38,055
Colonel Rhombus, Special Projects
Training. We've been expecting you.

216
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:41,683
Excuse me, but what was all this...?

217
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:43,560
That's how I welcome new trainees.

218
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:45,771
What's wrong with
coffee and a handshake?

219
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,483
It's my job to get you prepared
to go out into the field for combat.

220
00:24:49,692 --> 00:24:52,778
I must know right away
what I've got to work with.

221
00:24:52,987 --> 00:24:54,488
I've made my decision.

222
00:24:55,782 --> 00:24:57,699
- What's it say?
- Pussy.

223
00:24:57,867 --> 00:25:01,244
I don't think that's fair. They had swords.
What are we supposed to do?

224
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:05,248
It depends on your
particular arena of combat.

225
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:06,792
Maybe this.

226
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:25,977
I'll take you back to the base.

227
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:28,855
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

228
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:30,774
This is the obstacle course.

229
00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:34,319
It's the course familiar
to armed service recruits.

230
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:37,030
Except that here in
Intelligence Operative Training...

231
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:39,282
...we do it a bit differently.

232
00:25:39,492 --> 00:25:41,785
We add the element
of scorched earth.

233
00:25:51,254 --> 00:25:54,840
This is your standard
bog negotiation trial.

234
00:25:57,635 --> 00:26:00,761
You'll be judged
on survivability and time.

235
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:02,638
Enter...

236
00:26:02,848 --> 00:26:04,181
...now!

237
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:13,649
Heads down!

238
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,574
This will verify your ability
to stay afloat at high speeds.

239
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:36,922
We'll now begin with AFPSR...

240
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:39,550
...air force passive strain response.

241
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:44,054
You are not required
to exert yourself.

242
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:48,559
Only to survive aggravated
body temperature measurement.

243
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:56,358
Hot! Hot! Hot!

244
00:26:56,526 --> 00:27:00,946
We'll now determine your G-force
threshold. Relax, gentlemen.

245
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:06,202
- I guess we just sit here?
- Piece of cake.

246
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:42,863
- You want some coffee?
- Good idea.

247
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,456
Colonel, we were just talking...

248
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:55,709
We've had loads of fun here.
And, you know, we met new friends...

249
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,628
...and had a great lunch, right?

250
00:27:57,796 --> 00:28:00,713
Yeah, the tuna-and-cream casserole
was beautiful.

251
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:03,633
Anyway, we were just talking
and we'd like to go home now.

252
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:06,970
So thanks for the bruises,
and you can keep the stool samples.

253
00:28:12,935 --> 00:28:16,604
Boys, it would be a shame
to have to kill you now.

254
00:28:19,108 --> 00:28:22,777
- What did he mean by that?
- Means we're OIO.

255
00:28:22,987 --> 00:28:24,028
What's that?

256
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:26,823
Obligated involuntary officers.

257
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:31,619
Gentlemen, begin
radical vertical impact simulation...

258
00:28:31,787 --> 00:28:33,288
...now.

259
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:47,886
Come in.

260
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:54,976
You wanted to see us, sir?

261
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:00,857
Sit.

262
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:10,491
Congratulations, men.

263
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:14,078
You're about to enter the operational phase
of your assignment.

264
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:18,082
I'm not authorized to give you
the full operational package...

265
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,587
...but I will tell you the location of
your initial drop will be well inside Pakistan.

266
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:24,672
- Pakistan?
- Pakistan?

267
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:39,037
Is one of these people
our contact?

268
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:46,920
Okay. Who led the American League
in home runs in 1953?

269
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:52,843
I'll handle this.

270
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:27,502
What's he doing?
- That's just their way of saying hello.

271
00:31:27,712 --> 00:31:30,881
Hello. I'm Austin.

272
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:39,389
Hi. Bud Schnelker, liaison office.
U.S. Consulate, Karachi.

273
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,477
Rob Hodges. DIA, West Asian section.
Welcome to Pakistan.

274
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:47,022
Boy, you don't know
how glad we are to see you guys.

275
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:50,650
- When's lunch?
- Come on, guys. Jeep's over here.

276
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:00,660
I'm starving. What time you got?

277
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,626
Hey, listen. Could we stop?

278
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:12,004
- What's the matter?
- I gotta take a leak.

279
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:24,642
You should go too.

280
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:27,019
Are you my mother?

281
00:32:27,187 --> 00:32:30,773
Don't you think I'm capable of determining
my own time to go to the bathroom?

282
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:33,275
Isn't now one of those times?

283
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:34,735
No.

284
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,614
You don't feel urgent pressure
on the inner wall of your bladder...

285
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:42,743
...now, right at this moment?
- No. I'm fine.

286
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:46,247
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable
being fully relieved...

287
00:32:46,414 --> 00:32:50,793
...of any excess fluids that might be
building up, immediately, right now?

288
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:52,711
I got to take a whiz?

289
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,883
- Don't go away.
- We'll be here.

290
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,727
These guys are not our legitimate contacts.
These guys are KGB special branch.

291
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:10,896
- Come on.
- Don't tell me to come on.

292
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:12,481
That was a Russian wristwatch.

293
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:14,859
I know the country of origin
of every timepiece.

294
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,736
That was a Russian copy
of a 1969 Timex digital.

295
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:20,072
Is this some kind of a hobby
with you?

296
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,243
Most common slip-up in espionage.
We walked right into enemy hands.

297
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,081
- Hi.
- Just between us...

298
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:31,083
...if you know your final objective...

299
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:34,920
...you'd be smart to tell us. We could
probably work things out quicker for you.

300
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,175
Well, like he said, we still don't know.

301
00:33:39,342 --> 00:33:42,386
You know what they say
about this type of operation:

302
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,108
- Feet.
- Hat.

303
00:34:03,825 --> 00:34:04,992
Come on!

304
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:12,916
Look out!

305
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:23,760
- They sure had me fooled.
- The Soviets obviously know we're here now.

306
00:34:24,136 --> 00:34:27,639
- Where to, boss?
- First we check our gasoline supply.

307
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:31,309
- How's our gasoline supply?
- Eight 5-gallon cans.

308
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,354
- That enough to get us to an airport?
- I hope so.

309
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:38,149
We'll drive in shifts.
One drives, the other sleeps.

310
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:40,318
I'll drive, you sleep.

311
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,822
- Wake me up when you get tired.
- Okay.

312
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,492
- Good night.
- Good night.

313
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:51,621
- Sleep tight.
- Thanks.

314
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,290
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.
- Okay.

315
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:56,709
Night.

316
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:35,999
Good morning. Is there
an airport near here?

317
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:07,571
Austin. Your turn to drive.

318
00:36:14,537 --> 00:36:17,622
These are the Yusufzai.
They're Afghani freedom-fighters.

319
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:19,166
They're our allies.

320
00:36:22,962 --> 00:36:24,588
We're Americans!

321
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:42,147
Dr. Hadley!

322
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:49,863
Oh, my God!

323
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:54,117
What do you think you're doing?

324
00:36:58,498 --> 00:37:02,084
Sorry about this.
They're very distrustful of outsiders.

325
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,879
- No problem.
- Get your men to cut them down.

326
00:37:17,058 --> 00:37:18,809
- Who are you?
- Oh, sorry.

327
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,395
Hadley, London College of Medicine.

328
00:37:21,562 --> 00:37:24,523
They only allow us here
because we're helping with the wounded.

329
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:27,401
- They didn't realize you were with the effort.
- With who?

330
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:30,028
The United Nations medical effort,
of course.

331
00:37:30,238 --> 00:37:32,155
Aren't you
Drs. Trowbridge and Greenberg?

332
00:37:32,323 --> 00:37:33,949
Doctors?

333
00:37:34,117 --> 00:37:37,452
Yeah, sure. That's us. Uh-huh. We're
doctors. I'm Dr. Trowbridge. This is Dr...

334
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,745
- Greenbaum.
- Berg.

335
00:37:38,913 --> 00:37:41,248
Greenbaumberg. We're doctors.

336
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,501
Everybody looks fine here.
What do you say?

337
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:46,503
I say yes, doctor.

338
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,425
Stick your tongue out, please.

339
00:37:55,721 --> 00:37:56,888
Everything's fine.

340
00:37:59,225 --> 00:38:01,351
I guess we'll be heading back
to the old U.N.

341
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,439
And of course we'll let them know
what a good job you're doing here.

342
00:38:07,108 --> 00:38:09,650
The American sense of humor.

343
00:38:09,985 --> 00:38:13,112
Come on. The others
are anxious to meet you.

344
00:38:15,824 --> 00:38:18,701
Have we received
the last shipment of penicillin yet?

345
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:21,871
- Not yet, no.
- Possibly tomorrow.

346
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,664
Two envoys are coming.

347
00:38:29,546 --> 00:38:33,215
Ah. Here we are.
I'm Hadley, Internal Medicine.

348
00:38:33,717 --> 00:38:36,302
Dr. La Fong, Communicable Diseases.

349
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:39,138
Dr. Boyer, Bacteriology.

350
00:38:39,347 --> 00:38:43,893
Doctors Stinson, Marston, and Gill
of Northampton Trauma Institute.

351
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:47,062
And Dr. Imhaus of
the Zurich relief fund.

352
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:51,150
These are our newly arrived surgeons,
Trowbridge and Greenbaum.

353
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,068
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

354
00:38:53,236 --> 00:38:54,445
Doctor.
- Doctor.

355
00:38:54,613 --> 00:38:58,365
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

356
00:38:58,533 --> 00:39:00,242
Doctor.
- Doctor.

357
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:07,500
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

358
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:08,667
Doctor.

359
00:39:08,835 --> 00:39:11,170
- And, doctor.
- Did we miss anyone?

360
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:12,922
Why don't you gentlemen relax.

361
00:39:13,381 --> 00:39:16,759
The tribe's planning a raid on
a Soviet tank division tomorrow.

362
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:18,719
There will be plenty for us
to do then.

363
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:20,638
Doctors.

364
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:33,943
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

365
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,236
Doctor.
- Doctor.

366
00:39:35,403 --> 00:39:36,445
Doctor.
- Doctor.

367
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:38,489
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

368
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:41,825
We're not doctors.

369
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:45,120
We've got to get out of this place,
immediately, if not sooner.

370
00:39:45,288 --> 00:39:48,165
- Not until I've had...
- Excuse me.

371
00:39:49,543 --> 00:39:50,834
Her.

372
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:55,214
- Am I interrupting?
- No! Not at all. He was just on his way out.

373
00:39:59,302 --> 00:40:02,221
What happens when
the real doctors come?

374
00:40:05,475 --> 00:40:08,018
- Dr. Trowbridge.
- Where?

375
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:09,728
Oh! Right.

376
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:14,232
- Make yourself comfortable. Sit down.
- Thank you.

377
00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:29,497
What can I do for you?

378
00:40:29,707 --> 00:40:32,375
Dr. Trowbridge...
May I call you Homer?

379
00:40:32,585 --> 00:40:35,003
- Why?
- That's your name.

380
00:40:35,421 --> 00:40:39,007
Oh! Right! Homer. Of course.
What's your name?

381
00:40:39,258 --> 00:40:41,676
- Karen.
- Karen.

382
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:46,639
Dr. Trowbridge... Homer,
when you walked into this tent...

383
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:49,892
...it was the most exciting
moment of my life.

384
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:51,936
You just wait.

385
00:40:52,187 --> 00:40:55,106
You're a hero of mine.
I've read all your papers.

386
00:40:55,274 --> 00:40:56,566
How did you get my papers?

387
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:58,276
Oh, you mean my medical papers.
Right.

388
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:03,156
- Are you making fun of me?
- Oh, Karen. Our first fight.

389
00:41:03,365 --> 00:41:05,950
You might think I'm silly to worship you
the way I do...

390
00:41:06,118 --> 00:41:08,328
...but in my estimation, you're a genius.

391
00:41:09,371 --> 00:41:12,790
"Genius" is a pretty strong word,
but if you insist on using it...

392
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:14,042
...I can handle it.

393
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:17,337
In fact,
I hesitate to mention my problem.

394
00:41:17,546 --> 00:41:19,964
It's a task hardly worthy of your abilities.

395
00:41:20,382 --> 00:41:23,176
Go ahead and mention it.
There's nothing I wouldn't do.

396
00:41:23,344 --> 00:41:27,930
It's the khan's brother. He's been suffering
from pain in the right lower abdomen.

397
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,351
- Obviously an inflamed appendix.
- Obviously.

398
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,979
Dr. Hadley was going to remove it,
but now that you're here...

399
00:41:35,147 --> 00:41:38,566
I mean, just to see you perform
even the most simple surgery...

400
00:41:38,734 --> 00:41:41,194
...would be one of the great thrills
of my life.

401
00:41:41,403 --> 00:41:44,781
I'd rather not.
I don't have my instruments. Ahem.

402
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:48,159
Use Dr. Hadley's. Please, Homer.

403
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,080
The khan's brother is being prepped.
If you refuse to do this...

404
00:41:52,247 --> 00:41:55,208
...the khan will lose faith in you,
and us.

405
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,919
The consequences could be severe.

406
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:02,215
I see. Well...

407
00:42:02,758 --> 00:42:04,801
The truth is I am a great surgeon.

408
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:09,430
But, alas, I recently suffered severe
nerve damage in my left hand.

409
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,724
Oh, my God!

410
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:16,269
Look at that.
No feeling at all.

411
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:17,854
Dead.

412
00:42:18,064 --> 00:42:21,900
- How did that happen?
- I was lifting a car off a child.

413
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,944
It was a big car, a Cadillac.

414
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:30,075
I'm so disappointed.
And the khan, he'll be very suspicious.

415
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:34,621
- My God.
- Oh, there, there.

416
00:42:35,331 --> 00:42:38,125
Actually, I could
operate without my hands.

417
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:39,751
Dr. Greenbaum could be my hands.

418
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:42,254
I could tell him what to do,
and he'd do it for me.

419
00:42:42,422 --> 00:42:46,591
- Then you'd get a chance see me in action.
- That would be wonderful.

420
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:52,305
Of course, after I guide Dr. Greenbaum
through an operation, I get very depressed...

421
00:42:52,473 --> 00:42:55,100
...because I couldn't do it myself.

422
00:42:55,768 --> 00:42:57,436
It's a very bad time for me.

423
00:42:57,854 --> 00:43:00,981
Don't you worry. I'll be with you.

424
00:43:05,153 --> 00:43:06,611
Give me a break.

425
00:43:10,658 --> 00:43:12,409
About an hour?

426
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,119
Fine. An hour.

427
00:43:16,372 --> 00:43:17,497
Thank you.

428
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:20,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

429
00:43:23,463 --> 00:43:26,089
You're good with tools, aren't you?
Devices, instruments?

430
00:43:26,257 --> 00:43:28,675
What? You kidding? You're talking
to Millbarge here.

431
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:31,386
You want something converted,
built, repaired, modified.

432
00:43:31,554 --> 00:43:32,971
You're talking to Mr. Hands.

433
00:43:36,434 --> 00:43:39,060
Ah. Oh. Mind if I play through?

434
00:43:42,231 --> 00:43:46,026
Doctor. Doctor. Ha. Glad I'm not sick.

435
00:43:55,578 --> 00:43:58,538
If anything happens to him,
my people will be angry.

436
00:43:59,248 --> 00:44:04,211
To die in battle is glorious.
To die in a tent is disgrace.

437
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:07,506
And with that,
I give you Dr. Julius Greenbaum.

438
00:44:08,466 --> 00:44:09,883
Thank you, doctor.

439
00:44:10,051 --> 00:44:12,219
I'll just step out for a smoke.

440
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:13,887
Perhaps I'll stay here. Heh-heh.

441
00:44:14,304 --> 00:44:16,722
Today we will be removing
the patient's appendix.

442
00:44:16,932 --> 00:44:20,518
The first step in an operation
of this particular type is...

443
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:36,534
...to shave the patient.

444
00:44:42,499 --> 00:44:44,416
Ah. Forget it, get on with it.

445
00:44:46,586 --> 00:44:50,297
We'll skip the shave
and go to the operation.

446
00:44:50,507 --> 00:44:54,510
The second step
in an operation of this type is...

447
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:02,560
...anesthetic.

448
00:45:04,855 --> 00:45:08,816
But can't you tell? He's already been given
the required injection of Pentothal.

449
00:45:08,984 --> 00:45:10,025
Of course.

450
00:45:10,193 --> 00:45:14,572
He's already been given
the required injections.

451
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,908
All right.
Let us begin the operation.

452
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:39,805
Thank you, doctor.

453
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:43,517
And now, the first incision.

454
00:45:52,444 --> 00:45:53,485
Doctor.

455
00:45:53,695 --> 00:45:57,114
Isn't that incision a bit high
for an appendix?

456
00:45:57,324 --> 00:46:01,410
Do you wanna do the operation?
Fine. You come on up here, and you do it.

457
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:04,371
- Imhaus.
- He was cutting into his chest!

458
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:07,082
Did you see me cut into his chest?
Did I cut his chest?

459
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,336
I was probing to determine muscle tone
and skeletal girth.

460
00:46:10,503 --> 00:46:12,046
It's a new technique.

461
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:15,716
- We mock what we don't understand.
- Yeah.

462
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,677
Go ahead, will you? I'm getting hungry.

463
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,182
And now, the first incision.

464
00:46:47,456 --> 00:46:50,541
And now, I will incise.

465
00:46:57,216 --> 00:46:58,883
Cut the sucker.

466
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:17,193
This man is dead.

467
00:47:52,312 --> 00:47:53,563
Excuse us.

468
00:47:54,106 --> 00:47:55,273
Thank you.

469
00:49:02,131 --> 00:49:03,423
Let me do it!

470
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,489
Emmett!

471
00:49:27,824 --> 00:49:29,699
Help me!

472
00:49:35,123 --> 00:49:36,331
Let go!

473
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,259
The drive-in is closed.

474
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:33,387
We're with the Ace Tomato Company.

475
00:50:49,863 --> 00:50:53,532
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.
The military love it.

476
00:50:53,783 --> 00:50:56,619
Christ, will you look at this place?

477
00:51:13,803 --> 00:51:16,180
- Mr. Ruby.
- Sir.

478
00:51:16,348 --> 00:51:17,473
Mr. Keyes.

479
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:21,644
- Yes, sir.
- Won't you gentlemen have a Pepsi?

480
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:46,502
Two Pepsis to go.

481
00:51:54,886 --> 00:51:56,011
Now what?

482
00:51:56,221 --> 00:52:01,016
"Why don't you gentlemen
have a Pepsi?"

483
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:16,282
You do it.

484
00:52:45,477 --> 00:52:46,686
This way, gentlemen.

485
00:52:53,402 --> 00:52:55,153
Welcome to W.A.M.P.

486
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:06,372
- General Sline, sir.
- Yes, sergeant?

487
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,334
It's a collect call from Pakistan
for Mr. Ruby.

488
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:12,045
A Mr. Fitz-Hume.

489
00:53:12,254 --> 00:53:13,254
What?

490
00:53:13,422 --> 00:53:17,717
Folks, sorry. We'll just be another minute.
Thank you for your patience.

491
00:53:17,885 --> 00:53:19,510
It's person to person, sir,
collect.

492
00:53:19,678 --> 00:53:22,680
Their contacts tried to kill them
and they don't know what to do.

493
00:53:22,848 --> 00:53:26,392
And they told you this
over a public phone?

494
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,354
No, sir, the AT&T operator
told our operator.

495
00:53:30,731 --> 00:53:33,483
- They're insane.
- And apparently roaming free.

496
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:34,984
He's on line seven, sir.

497
00:53:35,152 --> 00:53:36,778
Get us the hell out of here!

498
00:53:36,945 --> 00:53:39,614
Everything's under control,
Mr. Fitz-Hume.

499
00:53:40,074 --> 00:53:41,574
Hold on one moment.

500
00:53:41,825 --> 00:53:44,118
Look, the longer we keep them
out in the field...

501
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:47,622
...the more heat we can draw
away from the real team.

502
00:53:48,457 --> 00:53:51,584
I agree. Let's send them over the border.

503
00:53:52,586 --> 00:53:55,671
- How do they get there?
- That's their problem.

504
00:53:55,881 --> 00:53:57,548
Hello, gentlemen.

505
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:01,344
Listen, we are organizing
a rescue operation for you.

506
00:54:01,595 --> 00:54:04,472
For after you've reached
your final objective.

507
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,307
What is our final objective?

508
00:54:06,475 --> 00:54:09,394
Information like that is given out
on a need-to-know basis only.

509
00:54:09,603 --> 00:54:12,688
And at this particular time,
you do not need to know.

510
00:54:12,898 --> 00:54:16,109
However, we can tell you
to make immediately...

511
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:18,820
...for the Soviet Pamir District.

512
00:54:20,114 --> 00:54:23,990
Wait for your next contact
on the road to Dushanbe.

513
00:54:28,496 --> 00:54:30,080
The road to Dushanbe?

514
00:54:30,248 --> 00:54:32,582
You practically told them the strike zone.

515
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,751
Listen.
Even if they make it there at all...

516
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:37,671
...they'll be plucked
by Soviet motorized infantry.

517
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:41,341
The road to Dushanbe is
a heavily traveled military artery.

518
00:54:42,135 --> 00:54:44,302
I guess that takes care of that.

519
00:54:45,513 --> 00:54:48,014
We must make no mistakes this time.

520
00:54:49,225 --> 00:54:52,894
Our whole way of life
hangs in the balance, gentlemen.

521
00:54:59,986 --> 00:55:01,361
Pamir? Dushanbe?

522
00:55:01,529 --> 00:55:04,364
- You're sure that's what he said?
- Right.

523
00:55:04,824 --> 00:55:08,243
- Those places are in Russia?
- And how.

524
00:55:12,665 --> 00:55:14,708
No, thanks.
I've already eaten.

525
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:17,377
How can we get there?
It must be 1000 miles from here.

526
00:55:17,545 --> 00:55:20,589
Actually, if this is
the lower Kohistan district...

527
00:55:20,756 --> 00:55:23,758
...we're only about 150 miles
from the Soviet border.

528
00:55:23,968 --> 00:55:25,802
You would have to know that.

529
00:55:27,054 --> 00:55:31,224
Wait a minute. The Soviet border?
How do we get across the Soviet border?

530
00:55:31,601 --> 00:55:34,394
We don't shave, sell the ambulance...

531
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:37,731
...sell our clothes, and go native.

532
00:55:51,245 --> 00:55:53,246
How far do we have to go on this bus?

533
00:55:53,414 --> 00:55:55,582
As far as it takes us.

534
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,386
Hey, look! It's Dr. Boyer!

535
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,480
She's the last person we want to see.

536
00:56:18,898 --> 00:56:21,024
No, she's nice.

537
00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:02,147
- Is this the border?
- No. Toll stop.

538
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:05,734
Hopefully, there won't be
any guard posts where we're gonna cross.

539
00:57:08,697 --> 00:57:11,615
Look. Dr. Boyer.

540
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,494
Leave it alone.

541
00:57:24,504 --> 00:57:27,006
I left without saying goodbye.
Can you ever forgive me?

542
00:57:31,094 --> 00:57:32,386
Where are you going?

543
00:57:32,554 --> 00:57:34,555
You can't deny
what happened between us.

544
00:57:34,723 --> 00:57:36,473
Don't touch me.

545
00:57:36,641 --> 00:57:37,850
Come on.

546
00:57:44,983 --> 00:57:46,567
"Don't touch me. "

547
00:57:59,539 --> 00:58:02,374
Look at this. This is really neat. Ha-ha.

548
00:58:05,712 --> 00:58:09,423
How do you like that? She lets a little thing
like death interfere with romance.

549
00:58:09,591 --> 00:58:14,136
They couldn't have done any better with
the khan's brother. They aren't doctors.

550
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:15,346
What do you mean?

551
00:58:15,513 --> 00:58:18,182
That metal case
she was packing on her horse.

552
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:20,559
- What about it?
- It's a Satscrambler terminal.

553
00:58:20,727 --> 00:58:22,936
Sophisticated system
for sending, scrambling...

554
00:58:23,104 --> 00:58:25,397
...receiving and unscrambling
satellite messages.

555
00:58:25,565 --> 00:58:27,899
So she's a sophisticated woman.

556
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:31,069
It's a highly classified piece
of intelligence hardware.

557
00:58:31,236 --> 00:58:35,907
- So she's a high-class intelligent piece.
- Come on, knock it off.

558
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:39,744
Well, what are you saying?
That they're spies like us?

559
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:43,081
They're spies,
but not necessarily on our side.

560
00:58:45,084 --> 00:58:47,669
I think it's our duty
as American operatives...

561
00:58:47,878 --> 00:58:50,922
...to follow her and find out
what she's up to.

562
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,383
- You just want to follow her.
- No.

563
00:58:53,592 --> 00:58:56,052
You're thinking with your dick.

564
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,679
They left their Land Rover here.

565
00:58:57,846 --> 00:59:00,932
They're probably headed right
for the border at some secret point.

566
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,142
It would save us a lot of trouble.

567
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:06,521
They do seem to be headed
in that general direction.

568
00:59:06,689 --> 00:59:10,024
- Maybe your dick's not so dumb.
- Got me through high school.

569
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:28,209
Do you think those men
are following us?

570
00:59:31,004 --> 00:59:34,465
They're most likely Chitrali nomads.
Not to worry.

571
00:59:52,818 --> 00:59:55,987
- Did you say sit?
- I didn't say sit.

572
00:59:56,488 --> 00:59:59,782
- Did you say sit?
- No, I didn't say sit. What...?

573
01:00:06,123 --> 01:00:07,165
Now what?

574
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,168
I guess we walk.

575
01:00:39,238 --> 01:00:41,031
Why do we have to carry
all this stuff?

576
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:44,785
The Dushanbe road runs across the top
of the mountains, the roof of the world.

577
01:00:44,952 --> 01:00:48,371
It'll be sub-arctic temperatures
up there, freezing. You'll thank me.

578
01:00:48,998 --> 01:00:50,540
"You'll thank me. "

579
01:01:22,114 --> 01:01:23,156
That's it.

580
01:01:23,616 --> 01:01:25,242
The Dushanbe road...

581
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,162
...where we're supposed to meet
our contacts. I hope.

582
01:01:35,962 --> 01:01:40,298
Only insofar as it serves to confirm
the president's own beliefs.

583
01:01:40,508 --> 01:01:43,301
This is quite an exciting project
you've got here, general.

584
01:01:43,511 --> 01:01:45,679
What was the cost
of this Star Wars system?

585
01:01:45,847 --> 01:01:47,931
- Just under 60 billion.
- Quite a bargain.

586
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:50,934
Sir. Printout from Gravsat.

587
01:01:52,103 --> 01:01:55,939
Let's see. A transmission from the field,
your GLG-20s.

588
01:01:57,441 --> 01:01:59,734
Well, wonderful.
They confirm estimated arrival...

589
01:01:59,944 --> 01:02:02,779
...at the strike site by 6 p. m.
Their time tomorrow.

590
01:02:02,947 --> 01:02:06,074
That's 9 a. m. Here.
Right on schedule.

591
01:02:06,242 --> 01:02:09,369
You can always count on our people.

592
01:02:17,795 --> 01:02:19,254
Well, this is it.

593
01:02:20,464 --> 01:02:22,799
Where are those contacts
we heard so much about?

594
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:25,218
Didn't exactly say where on the road,
did they?

595
01:02:25,386 --> 01:02:26,803
No.

596
01:02:27,471 --> 01:02:29,847
Maybe we should start hitchhiking.

597
01:02:30,056 --> 01:02:32,641
We're inside the Soviet Union.

598
01:02:33,768 --> 01:02:38,522
- I wish we hadn't lost Boyer.
- They were on horseback. We were on foot!

599
01:02:55,248 --> 01:02:57,166
It's the Tadzhik highway patrol.

600
01:02:58,919 --> 01:03:03,297
They were just sitting there in the dark.
They heard our entire conversation.

601
01:03:05,425 --> 01:03:06,842
What are they saying?

602
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:10,346
He says we needn't
bother whispering anymore.

603
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,681
Come on, let's get out of here.

604
01:03:12,891 --> 01:03:16,310
- We try that, they'll cut us down.
- We can't just go with them.

605
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:18,395
What other choice do we have?

606
01:03:18,563 --> 01:03:21,941
If we give ourselves up, the state
department can work out an exchange...

607
01:03:22,108 --> 01:03:23,359
...to get us home.
- Not me!

608
01:03:30,492 --> 01:03:32,201
Hi! Just me.

609
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:59,019
I was just looking for
the Burt Reynolds Theater.

610
01:04:03,441 --> 01:04:05,693
Don't I get a phone call?

611
01:04:14,661 --> 01:04:16,453
Who do you intend to call?

612
01:04:23,086 --> 01:04:26,088
Goddamn it.
He gives himself up.

613
01:04:30,677 --> 01:04:33,344
- What's your objective?
- My objective?

614
01:04:33,554 --> 01:04:37,932
I object to taking a girl out and buying her
dinner and then she won't put out for you.

615
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:46,774
- Why are you here?
- Why am I here? Why are you here?

616
01:04:46,942 --> 01:04:50,069
Why is anybody here?
I think it was Jean-Paul Sartre who said...

617
01:04:50,237 --> 01:04:52,155
How do you spell Sartre? Ow!

618
01:04:52,614 --> 01:04:54,157
And let that be a lesson to you!

619
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:56,617
Every minute you don't tell us
why you're here...

620
01:04:56,785 --> 01:04:58,703
...I cut off a finger.

621
01:04:58,871 --> 01:05:01,330
- Mine or yours?
- Yours.

622
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,582
Damn!

623
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:06,335
Oh! Why are you still hitting me?
He's gonna cut my fingers off.

624
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:09,922
- You have 30 seconds.
- You're not gonna hum the Jeopardy theme?

625
01:05:10,132 --> 01:05:13,509
We start with the little one.

626
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:16,304
All right. All right.
I'm an American agent.

627
01:05:16,638 --> 01:05:17,638
And...?

628
01:05:17,806 --> 01:05:19,474
And...

629
01:05:19,641 --> 01:05:23,352
They sent me here to
assassinate your premier.

630
01:05:23,562 --> 01:05:27,940
- I knew it! Pay up.
- Let's cut his fingers off anyway.

631
01:05:28,108 --> 01:05:29,817
No.

632
01:05:29,985 --> 01:05:33,029
Let's take him back to headquarters
in Moscow.

633
01:05:33,197 --> 01:05:36,407
Good move. Good move. Headquarters.

634
01:05:40,245 --> 01:05:42,705
It shouldn't be much further now.
We've made good time.

635
01:05:42,873 --> 01:05:45,666
We'll go on foot from here.

636
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:28,042
Goddamn it!

637
01:06:45,726 --> 01:06:47,477
Hi.

638
01:06:47,645 --> 01:06:50,230
How you doing?
Remember me?

639
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:53,650
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

640
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:57,028
They surprised us.
Border troops.

641
01:06:57,238 --> 01:06:58,613
They got my partner.

642
01:06:58,823 --> 01:07:01,408
- Did they get you too?
- I'm fine!

643
01:07:01,576 --> 01:07:06,413
No wonder neither of you could do that
appendix operation. You're spies like us!

644
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:10,333
- You mean you're...?
- Austin Millbarge. I'm a GLG-20.

645
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:12,544
So...

646
01:07:12,712 --> 01:07:16,423
...you two are the other GLG-20s.
The decoys!

647
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:18,884
- Decoys?!
- Lower your voice.

648
01:07:19,093 --> 01:07:23,388
That's why they rushed us through training,
why we were met by the KGB...

649
01:07:23,598 --> 01:07:26,558
...why they sent us into enemy hands.
- Right.

650
01:07:26,767 --> 01:07:31,396
I am extremely pissed off.
My partner and I were set up.

651
01:07:31,606 --> 01:07:35,942
Forget it, that's behind us.
Our first priority is to cover those bodies...

652
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:40,322
...establish a new base camp
and complete this project.

653
01:07:40,531 --> 01:07:45,744
Project? Fitz-Hume is in the custody of
the Tadzhik highway patrol because of you.

654
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:52,584
The only project I have to complete
is to get my partner out.

655
01:08:10,102 --> 01:08:13,772
Fitz-Hume! Fitz-Hume!

656
01:08:26,118 --> 01:08:27,160
Come on!

657
01:08:38,922 --> 01:08:43,342
- Look at this. Did you do that?
- Yeah, I did that for you.

658
01:09:09,786 --> 01:09:14,790
You know, I must really like you because
I don't like horses and I hate guns.

659
01:09:34,936 --> 01:09:37,521
- What's this?
- You don't want it!

660
01:09:49,743 --> 01:09:50,743
Duck!

661
01:10:05,759 --> 01:10:07,468
I'll get the horse.

662
01:10:19,314 --> 01:10:20,564
Let's go!

663
01:10:23,318 --> 01:10:25,402
Hi-yo, Silver! Away!

664
01:11:02,815 --> 01:11:06,651
It's "Soul Finger" by the Bar-kays.

665
01:11:07,528 --> 01:11:10,113
They must be having trouble getting gigs.

666
01:11:28,549 --> 01:11:31,634
This is a Soviet ICBM site.

667
01:11:37,182 --> 01:11:41,894
That's an SS-50 long-range
rocket and mobile launcher.

668
01:11:46,525 --> 01:11:49,819
They just moved it in here.
Haven't even put up their locator beacon.

669
01:11:49,987 --> 01:11:53,906
Means they're not hooked in to
Soviet defense. They are radio-isolated.

670
01:11:54,116 --> 01:11:55,324
Only three men.

671
01:11:57,494 --> 01:11:58,494
And their mother.

672
01:12:16,138 --> 01:12:17,138
Let me see that.

673
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:18,890
Come on!

674
01:12:30,068 --> 01:12:32,820
Honestly.
You two are unbelievable.

675
01:12:33,739 --> 01:12:38,075
- Wait a minute. What are we doing here?
- This is our final objective.

676
01:12:38,285 --> 01:12:42,287
Our project orders are to subdue the crew
and seize control of this emplacement.

677
01:12:42,455 --> 01:12:46,166
Hold it, sister. We're not going near
that thing. That missile is tipped with...

678
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:48,960
...a 40-megaton nuclear warhead.
- Good night, everybody.

679
01:12:49,128 --> 01:12:50,921
- Where are you going?
- Home.

680
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:55,258
For once, I am in complete agreement.
We should all get up and leave immediately.

681
01:12:55,426 --> 01:12:57,052
You know what those things can do?

682
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:00,055
Suck the paint off your house
and give your family an orange Afro.

683
01:13:00,223 --> 01:13:04,434
I don't care what you two do,
but I'm fulfilling my obligation.

684
01:13:04,602 --> 01:13:08,813
I intend to go down there and seize control
of that emplacement alone if I have to.

685
01:13:08,981 --> 01:13:10,106
Now, wait a minute.

686
01:13:10,274 --> 01:13:13,527
You know we'd do anything for you,
but we can't go seize that rocket.

687
01:13:13,694 --> 01:13:17,322
- We'd have to kill everybody down there.
- And I'm not killing anybody.

688
01:13:17,657 --> 01:13:19,199
I'm not either.

689
01:13:26,374 --> 01:13:30,335
Gentlemen, I think you both should realize
the gravity of this moment.

690
01:13:30,545 --> 01:13:35,465
I've spent the last two and a half years
of my life preparing for this penetration.

691
01:13:35,675 --> 01:13:38,635
This afternoon I buried
my partner, Jerry Hadley...

692
01:13:38,803 --> 01:13:43,557
...perhaps the finest, most dedicated
GLG-20 in the history of the service.

693
01:13:43,766 --> 01:13:46,476
He is now forever entombed
in a snowy grave.

694
01:13:46,644 --> 01:13:48,562
And it's not going to be for nothing!

695
01:13:49,772 --> 01:13:54,818
We are here today to guarantee
the personal freedom of every American.

696
01:13:55,027 --> 01:13:59,948
And we should never forget the words of
President John F. Kennedy, who said:

697
01:14:00,116 --> 01:14:02,826
"Ask not what your country can
do for you...

698
01:14:03,035 --> 01:14:06,288
...but what you can do for
your country. "

699
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:10,208
Will you marry me?

700
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:19,593
Now...

701
01:14:20,678 --> 01:14:24,139
These are high-compression
tranquilizer pistols.

702
01:14:24,307 --> 01:14:26,766
We're not going to kill anybody...

703
01:14:27,101 --> 01:14:30,854
...but you've got to get in close
to use them.

704
01:14:43,366 --> 01:14:46,619
Hours, T-minus two until designated
target apogee.

705
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:54,168
Sir, all air traffic has been
diverted from our response corridor.

706
01:14:54,377 --> 01:14:57,838
What's our present on-line power
reading?

707
01:14:58,256 --> 01:15:01,592
Michigan reactor and Washington State
atomic plants on-line, general.

708
01:15:03,887 --> 01:15:05,304
Lock us in, sergeant.

709
01:15:13,563 --> 01:15:14,897
W.A.M.P. Secure, sir.

710
01:15:16,524 --> 01:15:20,235
All right. Let's go to
response level yellow.

711
01:15:20,528 --> 01:15:22,905
Initiating level yellow.

712
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:54,603
Run your full servo and arming.

713
01:16:32,142 --> 01:16:34,560
Servo on and armed.

714
01:17:02,087 --> 01:17:03,713
"Soul Finger. "

715
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,928
"Soul Finger. "

716
01:17:49,927 --> 01:17:51,511
What's she saying?

717
01:17:52,221 --> 01:17:54,597
Hair... Hairbrush... Headrest.

718
01:17:55,057 --> 01:17:57,266
Jesus, where'd you learn
your Russian, J.C. Penney?

719
01:18:05,108 --> 01:18:08,402
When she was a child in Lithuania,
her uncle used to tell a story...

720
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:12,824
...about strange beings that came down
from a disk and stole an ox...

721
01:18:13,033 --> 01:18:16,494
...which the village had put aside
for roasting.

722
01:18:16,703 --> 01:18:20,122
I told you it would work.
Everybody knows about UFOs.

723
01:18:20,332 --> 01:18:23,793
Apparently the aliens from the silver disk
dissected the ox...

724
01:18:23,961 --> 01:18:26,504
...and kept the best pieces of meat
for themselves.

725
01:18:26,713 --> 01:18:28,965
So what?
So we owe them a cow.

726
01:18:30,342 --> 01:18:32,677
Where do we get one?

727
01:19:05,334 --> 01:19:06,626
Do what I do.

728
01:19:39,744 --> 01:19:42,412
Satscram signal from the strike site.

729
01:19:42,622 --> 01:19:46,082
Your GLG-20s have penetrated successfully
and are awaiting the go-code.

730
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:49,169
Open and lock down ground deflectors.

731
01:20:25,665 --> 01:20:27,832
Ground deflectors opened and locked.

732
01:20:42,056 --> 01:20:45,808
- Okay, Dostoyevsky, what does it say?
- It says:

733
01:20:46,017 --> 01:20:48,018
"Approach SS-50...

734
01:20:48,228 --> 01:20:51,772
...source programmable rocket. "

735
01:20:59,572 --> 01:21:00,823
Easy.

736
01:21:01,032 --> 01:21:05,703
"Find control box at front
of transporter. "

737
01:21:08,999 --> 01:21:10,499
This is a snap.

738
01:21:10,917 --> 01:21:14,628
"For erector panel, push red button. "

739
01:21:27,392 --> 01:21:29,309
"Depress red key switch.

740
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:33,272
- Enter first numbered sequence. "
- Go.

741
01:21:33,606 --> 01:21:34,940
"Three-three-nine...

742
01:21:36,276 --> 01:21:38,277
...dash two-five-nine...

743
01:21:39,237 --> 01:21:40,320
...dash six.

744
01:21:42,741 --> 01:21:45,451
Acknowledge compliance
on Satscram now. "

745
01:21:45,618 --> 01:21:48,746
GLG-20s acknowledge
programming and compliance.

746
01:21:48,955 --> 01:21:51,457
Bring all birds
into final bounce mode.

747
01:22:54,019 --> 01:22:55,853
Bounce mode engaged.

748
01:22:57,397 --> 01:22:59,524
Send them the go-code.

749
01:23:13,413 --> 01:23:16,374
"Go with numbered sequence,
seven-four...

750
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:19,544
...dash seven-four...

751
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:21,879
...dash eight-eight-three...

752
01:23:22,047 --> 01:23:24,173
...dash five, dash three. "

753
01:24:28,947 --> 01:24:32,200
SAC-COM confirms an outbound blip
from Soviet Central Asia.

754
01:24:33,118 --> 01:24:34,202
It's on its way.

755
01:24:34,411 --> 01:24:37,914
Override all SAC alerts
with stand-down orders for 10 minutes.

756
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:41,375
SAC override code, entered.

757
01:24:41,627 --> 01:24:43,461
Error. Stand down.

758
01:25:15,284 --> 01:25:17,327
I think we just started World War Ill.

759
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:24,125
She wants to know why
we would do such a thing.

760
01:25:27,296 --> 01:25:28,713
Tell her so do we.

761
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:45,021
- What are they saying?
- It's 4:47 a. m.

762
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:49,109
They're saying it'll be 28 minutes before
the rocket detonates above its target...

763
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:51,695
...somewhere inside
the continental United States.

764
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,911
Let's see, 28 minutes. That's 18 until
it's inside the U.S. Radar cup.

765
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:04,541
Figure two for our response,
say 20 until total commitment.

766
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:09,212
Figure 20, 22 until the first impact
of our retaliatory strike.

767
01:26:09,422 --> 01:26:13,758
I figure we have 42 minutes until
the end of civilization as we know it.

768
01:26:18,097 --> 01:26:21,683
- You want to go out with a bang?
- I beg your pardon?

769
01:26:22,893 --> 01:26:24,102
Just an idea.

770
01:26:24,353 --> 01:26:28,106
You know, if we were sitting in a bar,
I'd throw a drink right in your face.

771
01:26:32,737 --> 01:26:34,946
But under the circumstances...

772
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:36,990
...it's not such a bad idea.

773
01:28:17,924 --> 01:28:19,591
Release full pulse.

774
01:28:20,218 --> 01:28:21,218
Three...

775
01:28:22,262 --> 01:28:23,762
...two...

776
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:25,431
...one.

777
01:28:25,682 --> 01:28:26,682
Mark.

778
01:28:37,735 --> 01:28:40,779
Bounce pulse failed to connect
with target, sir.

779
01:28:41,448 --> 01:28:44,199
- Just what are you saying, soldier?
- We missed it, sir.

780
01:28:44,367 --> 01:28:46,702
- What?
- We missed the rocket. It didn't work.

781
01:28:48,746 --> 01:28:51,540
Didn't work?
Where did the pulse go?

782
01:28:51,749 --> 01:28:54,709
Don't know, sir,
but it definitely didn't connect.

783
01:29:04,386 --> 01:29:06,679
- Wow.
- Excellent!

784
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:13,728
- We'd better call the president.
- We're not calling anyone.

785
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:15,897
What do you mean,
we're not calling anyone?

786
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:19,775
The president must know that this attack
was not initiated by the Soviet Union.

787
01:29:23,906 --> 01:29:26,574
We are prepared for this contingency.

788
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:29,035
What in hell do you intend to do?

789
01:29:29,203 --> 01:29:30,745
You understand, sir...

790
01:29:30,913 --> 01:29:34,707
...that we are responsible for launching
a nuclear weapon against our own country!

791
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:38,419
No one outside this command center
has that information, gentlemen.

792
01:29:38,879 --> 01:29:41,756
When we commissioned
the Schmectel Corporation to research...

793
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:45,176
...this precise event-sequence scenario,
it was determined...

794
01:29:45,344 --> 01:29:48,971
...that the continual stockpiling
and development of our nuclear arsenal...

795
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:54,435
...was becoming self-defeating.
A weapon unused is a useless weapon.

796
01:29:54,895 --> 01:29:57,813
SAC-COM confirms.
All defense systems commitment ready.

797
01:29:58,023 --> 01:30:02,109
We have verification. The president
is aboard the airborne command center now.

798
01:30:03,487 --> 01:30:08,616
I'm sure it will only be a matter of minutes
before the president commits to total release.

799
01:30:11,537 --> 01:30:13,704
Jesus Christ.

800
01:30:18,627 --> 01:30:23,923
You see, we had to show that we had
the technical capability...

801
01:30:24,508 --> 01:30:26,008
...and were determined.

802
01:30:27,636 --> 01:30:32,640
History demonstrates conclusively
that naive wishing for peace...

803
01:30:33,141 --> 01:30:37,353
...is the surest possible way
to encourage an aggressor.

804
01:30:37,521 --> 01:30:40,231
I demand you place me in communication
with the president!

805
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:43,818
Relax, Mr. Ruby. This facility
is more than adequately stocked...

806
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:46,946
...for a comfortable 17 months
of below-ground existence.

807
01:30:47,155 --> 01:30:48,364
We'll be fine.

808
01:30:48,615 --> 01:30:51,993
By your actions, sir, you are risking
the future of the human race!

809
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:56,580
To guarantee the American
way of life...

810
01:30:57,415 --> 01:31:00,208
...I'm willing to take that risk.

811
01:31:10,845 --> 01:31:14,347
Hard to believe it's been only
15 minutes since I destroyed the world.

812
01:31:15,349 --> 01:31:18,059
In another 15 minutes, it'll all be over.

813
01:31:18,436 --> 01:31:21,187
Such a short time to destroy a world.

814
01:31:21,647 --> 01:31:25,859
And to think my high school guidance
counselor said I'd never amount to anything.

815
01:31:26,068 --> 01:31:27,569
It just goes to show...

816
01:31:27,778 --> 01:31:30,655
Guidance?
Source Programmable guidance!

817
01:31:31,115 --> 01:31:34,618
Fitz-Hume! Boyer!
Get up! Get up!

818
01:31:39,665 --> 01:31:42,292
Come on! Come on!

819
01:31:43,628 --> 01:31:46,588
Fitz-Hume! Boyer!

820
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:55,847
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

821
01:31:56,098 --> 01:31:58,725
- You have a tent?
- Bring me the Satscram dish.

822
01:31:58,934 --> 01:32:00,226
I think we can recall it.

823
01:32:00,394 --> 01:32:02,896
What do you mean?
You mean like a defective Pinto?

824
01:32:05,941 --> 01:32:08,902
Take this up. Up. Climb!

825
01:32:10,946 --> 01:32:13,782
Grab a rock! Grab a hammer!
We can divert it!

826
01:32:13,949 --> 01:32:17,452
It's made to respond to in-flight commands
through their sat-relay network.

827
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:20,580
- Here's a rock.
- Go to the Satscram terminal.

828
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:24,501
- Now what?
- Smash that thing.

829
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:31,758
- It's broken.
- Bring it here.

830
01:32:31,967 --> 01:32:33,218
Not the rock.

831
01:32:36,931 --> 01:32:39,015
What's the use?
It's probably all over anyway.

832
01:32:39,183 --> 01:32:42,602
No, no, no. All we have to do
is switch sending boards.

833
01:32:45,773 --> 01:32:49,567
Boyer, start sending the launch sequence
in reverse order.

834
01:32:49,985 --> 01:32:50,985
Yes, sir.

835
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:01,745
Fitz-Hume, hold these together.

836
01:33:02,247 --> 01:33:05,124
I've got to make the splice.
Hold it together.

837
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:07,960
- Ow! I got a shock.
- And you will.

838
01:33:08,128 --> 01:33:11,130
I don't care how painful it is,
you've got to hold them together.

839
01:33:11,297 --> 01:33:12,965
You are the circuit bridge.

840
01:33:13,216 --> 01:33:15,843
- But, but, but...
- I need...

841
01:33:16,511 --> 01:33:17,636
Bigger than a bread box?

842
01:33:17,804 --> 01:33:20,973
- I need...
- The title of a movie?

843
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:27,479
Animals in their natural habitats?
Book title? Things that are round?

844
01:33:27,647 --> 01:33:30,274
Things that are square.
Things that are being electrocuted?

845
01:33:30,442 --> 01:33:32,359
Got it!

846
01:33:41,828 --> 01:33:44,830
Miles: Five...

847
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:46,039
...zero...

848
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:47,875
...zero...

849
01:33:56,509 --> 01:33:58,385
- We did it!
- We did?

850
01:33:59,012 --> 01:34:00,053
We did it!

851
01:34:02,724 --> 01:34:04,641
Can I borrow your tent?

852
01:34:05,643 --> 01:34:09,229
SAC-COM confirms destruction
of the inbound at Zulu 3000 hours.

853
01:34:09,397 --> 01:34:12,316
- What about the rest of their inbounds?
There are none, sir.

854
01:34:12,525 --> 01:34:15,903
Both the U.S. And Soviet
response chain on full recall.

855
01:34:16,821 --> 01:34:19,782
Damn. Recall.

856
01:34:44,057 --> 01:34:47,017
- Place them under arrest. All of them.
- Wait!

857
01:34:47,227 --> 01:34:49,812
- We don't know these men.
- Oh! We were kidnapped!

858
01:34:50,021 --> 01:34:52,439
- That's right! Kidnapped!
We were!

859
01:34:52,649 --> 01:34:54,191
We were at the drive-in!

860
01:34:54,609 --> 01:34:59,028
As the disarmament talks
continue through closed sessions...

861
01:34:59,196 --> 01:35:02,865
...last night and on into this afternoon,
a feeling of positive anticipation...

862
01:35:03,075 --> 01:35:05,117
...is shared by everyone
in the press corps.

863
01:35:07,579 --> 01:35:09,664
The doors to the conference room
are opening.

864
01:35:09,873 --> 01:35:13,835
I see the chief United States delegate,
Mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume.

865
01:35:14,628 --> 01:35:16,712
Mr. Fitz-Hume.
- Hi, Ed.

866
01:35:16,922 --> 01:35:21,843
Everybody at home is most anxious to know
how things are going in there.

867
01:35:22,052 --> 01:35:24,929
Well, Ed, right now we're at
an extremely sensitive juncture.

868
01:35:25,097 --> 01:35:28,641
And of course, the slightest misperceived
phrase or gesture...

869
01:35:28,851 --> 01:35:31,185
...could upset everything
we've achieved today.

870
01:35:31,395 --> 01:35:34,564
- Now, if you'll excuse me, Ed.
- Thank you, Mr. Fitz-Hume.

871
01:35:34,773 --> 01:35:35,940
Thank you, Ed.

872
01:35:36,108 --> 01:35:39,110
Mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume,
chief state department negotiator...

873
01:35:39,278 --> 01:35:42,613
...here at the disarmament talks,
re-entering what he has called...

874
01:35:42,781 --> 01:35:45,116
...the "delicately balanced negotiations. "

875
01:35:48,579 --> 01:35:50,329
Comrade!

876
01:35:53,292 --> 01:35:54,750
Okay.

877
01:35:55,043 --> 01:36:00,298
"What Little Richard song
was the title of a 1950s movie...

878
01:36:00,757 --> 01:36:03,551
...starring Jayne Mansfield?"

879
01:36:12,227 --> 01:36:14,520
"Good Golly Miss Molly"?

880
01:36:16,815 --> 01:36:18,149
"Great Balls of Fire"?

881
01:36:18,358 --> 01:36:20,818
Wrong! It was
"The Girl Can't Help It. "

882
01:36:22,321 --> 01:36:24,280
- Sorry. You lose.
- Eastern Europe.

883
01:36:24,489 --> 01:36:25,990
Eastern Europe.
