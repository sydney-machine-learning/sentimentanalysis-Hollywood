1
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,810
<i>She's, um...</i>

2
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,063
<i>Well, she's...</i>

3
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,566
something a little strange.

4
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,527
That's what you notice,

5
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,072
that she's not a woman
like all the others.

6
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,993
She seems all wrapped up in herself.

7
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,830
Lost...

8
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:08,001
in a world she carries
deep inside her...

9
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:13,799
but surrounded by a world of luxury.

10
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,469
A sumptuous boudoir.

11
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:22,015
Her bed all quilted satin.

12
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,102
Chiffon drapes.

13
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:31,108
From her window,
you can see the Eiffel Tower.

14
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:37,322
Suddenly, her maid brings in
a gift-wrapped box.

15
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,409
A token from an admirer.

16
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:45,664
She's a cabaret star of the highest rank.

17
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,292
She opens the box.

18
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,794
It's a diamond bracelet.

19
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,672
But she sends it back.

20
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:57,426
Men are really at her feet.
She's known a few.

21
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,137
But not the one

22
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,765
she's been waiting for all her life.

23
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,809
A real man.

24
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,897
Her maid has prepared her a foam bath.

25
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:15,027
The star takes a towel
and wraps it around her hair

26
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,030
like a turban.

27
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:22,075
Her fingernails painted a rosy peach,

28
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,163
she unfastens her taffeta nightgown

29
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,791
and lets it slide smoothly
down her thighs

30
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,377
to the tile floor.

31
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,713
Her skin glistens.

32
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:40,177
Her petite ankle slips
into the perfumed water.

33
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:45,349
Then her sensuous legs,
until finally her whole body

34
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,685
is caressed with foam.

35
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,854
I told you.
No erotic descriptions.

36
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,774
Whatever, but she's a ravishing woman.

37
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,192
Do you know what I mean?

38
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,194
I mean...

39
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:02,407
the most ravishing woman in the world.

40
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,201
Yeah, sure.

41
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,369
She really is.

42
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,537
Perfect figure.

43
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,998
Classical features.

44
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:14,795
But with these big green...

45
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,214
<i>eyes.</i>

46
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,050
They're black.

47
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,802
I'm the one who saw the movie,

48
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,221
but if that's what you want,
big black eyes.

49
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,139
Kind eyes.

50
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,268
<i>Tender eyes.</i>

51
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:33,230
<i>But beware.
They can see...</i>

52
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,815
<i>everything.</i>

53
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,277
<i>There's nothing you can hide from them.</i>

54
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,243
No matter how lonely she may be,

55
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:50,580
she keeps men... at a distance.

56
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,208
She's probably got bad breath 
or something.

57
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,046
If you're going to crack jokes
about a film

58
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,465
that I happen to be fond of,
there's no reason to go on.

59
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,552
All right, all right, go ahead.

60
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,181
Suddenly...

61
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,934
we're in Paris.

62
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,355
Troops are marching

63
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,984
right underneath the Arc de Triomphe.

64
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,197
Really handsome soldiers,

65
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,575
and...

66
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:31,288
the French girls are applauding
as they pass by.

67
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:36,126
Then we are on this typical
Parisian back street.

68
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:40,088
Dead end, sort of --
sort of looking up a hill,

69
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:45,177
<i>and these really weird-looking Frenchmen --</i>

70
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,846
<i>not the typical ones with the berets --</i>

71
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,308
<i>are unloading a truck --
It's wartime of course --</i>

72
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,896
<i>and the boxes contain contraband delicacies 
like canned meat,</i>

73
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,316
<i>the best cheeses...</i>

74
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,235
mm, peaches in syrup...

75
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,612
Don't talk about food.

76
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,698
Not to mention the hams and the patÃ©s.

77
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,784
I'm serious.

78
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,328
No food and no naked women.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,834
You still feeling dizzy?

80
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,088
It's my back.

81
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,173
You've been bleeding again.
Look at your shirt.

82
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,174
It's all wet.

83
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,344
It's just sweat.
I had another fever break.

84
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:35,769
Well, what do you think so far?
Isn't it fabulous?

85
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,354
Helps pass the time.

86
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,523
Does that mean that you like it?

87
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,026
Doesn't help any great cause,
but I guess it's all right.

88
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,362
Blessed Mary, is that all
you can talk about?

89
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,948
You must have studied 
political philosophies in school.

90
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,991
The phrase is "political science",

91
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,369
and the answer is no.
I studied journalism.

92
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,371
Oh, so you can appreciate a good story.

93
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,289
And easily spot a cheap one.

94
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,333
I know it's nothing terribly intellectual

95
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,793
like you must be used to.

96
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,337
It's just a... romance,

97
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,048
but it's so beautiful.

98
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,386
Now...

99
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,388
suddenly...

100
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:16,309
this military convoy rushes forward!

101
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,982
<i>Marvelous German soldiers

102
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,152
<i>catch those weird smugglers in the act</i>

103
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,195
<i>and arrest them all.</i>

104
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:39,833
But watching nearby...

105
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,795
is this small truck.

106
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,507
With these two French thugs
from the Resistance...

107
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,177
who are spying on the Germans.

108
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,680
<i>This hulking clubfoot
and his half-deaf flunky.</i>

109
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,223
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

110
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,517
Those weird guys the Germans arrested?

111
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,436
Yes.

112
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,398
What do you mean
they didn't look French?

113
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,984
They didn't look French.
They looked...

114
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,362
um... Turkish.

115
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,114
I'm not sure, but they had these,

116
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,782
like, these caps on their heads,

117
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,659
like these -- like these, um...

118
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,457
Turkish. Fezzes.

119
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:25,921
Those caps are yarmulkes.

120
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,007
Can't you see this is
a fucking anti-Semitic film?

121
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,469
Oh, come on!

122
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,471
Wait.

123
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,389
This must have been a German movie, right?

124
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,142
I don't know.
It was from years ago.

125
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,186
Look.

126
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,482
I don't explain my movies.
It just ruins the emotion.

127
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,484
This must have been
a Nazi propaganda film

128
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,443
done during the war.

129
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,239
I don't know.
That's just the background.

130
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,993
This is where the important part begins,

131
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,247
the part about the lovers.

132
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,499
<i>It's divine.</i>

133
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:10,507
<i>Every night, the chic set flocks 
to this exclusive club,</i>

134
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:15,220
<i>with lovers at every table,
spies in every corner,</i>

135
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:20,517
<i>and the top officers
of the German high command.</i>

136
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,520
<i>One of them is Werner.</i>

137
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,439
<i>Werner -- so distant, so divine --</i>

138
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,233
<i>and the chief of counterintelligence</i>

139
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,526
<i>for all France.</i>

140
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,863
<i>Oh, and Michelle, 
with her angel face,</i>

141
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,117
<i>the cigarette girl 
who really is working for, the --</i>

142
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,368
<i>Well, you'll see.</i>

143
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,371
<i>And then...</i>

144
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,874
<i>The moment they're all waiting for...</i>

145
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,919
<i>Da da!</i> 

146
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:52,549
Stepping into the spotlight
is that legendary star,

147
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,427
that ravishing chanteuse,

148
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,221
Leni...

149
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,556
Lamaison.

150
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,371
Yes?

151
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,915
<i>Yakov and Naveed were arrested.</i>

152
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,541
Did you get the map?

153
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,627
No. There was no time.

154
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,004
Just get it.

155
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,632
Nothing else matters.

156
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,634
Vive la France!

157
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:10,019
<i>Werner's eyes begin to burn into her soul.</i>

158
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,272
<i>Eyes like the claws of an eagle.</i>

159
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,524
<i>Inescapable.</i>

160
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,289
What are you laughing at?

161
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,668
Well, it must be something.

162
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,757
At you.

163
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,095
And me.

164
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,706
What's going on?

165
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,125
Quiet!

166
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,835
They're bringing someone new.

167
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,676
What time is it anyway?

168
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,513
He's really bleeding.

169
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,641
Is it a political prisoner?

170
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:37,190
They don't treat you like that
for stealing bananas.

171
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,527
Mm. You know him?

172
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,108
Come on. Go.

173
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,948
Your name?
Hey! You!

174
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,825
And your name?

175
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,501
Luis Molina.

176
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,336
Valentin Arregui.

177
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,859
Do you want to shave?

178
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,283
Well, I didn't mean your legs.

179
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,500
What is the matter?

180
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,796
I don't understand why they stopped 
my interrogation.

181
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,887
It's been almost a week.

182
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,890
Why couldn't they give me

183
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,893
that handsome leading blond man here

184
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,521
to keep me company, instead of you?

185
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,857
What the hell are you talking about?

186
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,234
Are you afraid to talk about sex?

187
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,780
You really want to know, Molina?

188
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,406
I find you boring.

189
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:54,410
Darling, you don't know page one.

190
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,997
You know I'm a faggot.
Well, congratulations.

191
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,916
You know I corrupted a minor.

192
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,920
Well, that's even on TV,
film at 11:00.

193
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,547
You really like those Nazi blonds, 
don't you?

194
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,551
Well, no, you see,
I detest politics,

195
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,096
but I'm mad about the leading man.

196
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,848
He's so romantic.

197
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,226
Should I be shot for that?

198
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,936
Your Nazis are about as romantic

199
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,438
as the fucking warden
and his torture room.

200
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,940
I can imagine.

201
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,193
No.

202
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,028
You can't.

203
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,988
You can't sleep?

204
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,992
You mind if I tell my picture?

205
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,998
After the show...

206
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,834
Leni changes into a satin evening gown

207
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,003
that makes her look heavenly.

208
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,213
Firm breasts...

209
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,716
thin waist...

210
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,009
smooth hips...

211
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,011
Is this propaganda or porno?

212
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,722
<i>Just listen.
You'll see.</i>

213
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,015
Excuse me.

214
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,642
Leni.

215
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,688
What is it, Michelle?

216
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,943
Leni...

217
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,322
I'm a traitor.
A traitor to France.

218
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,199
What do you mean?

219
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,493
I'm going to have a baby.

220
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,078
But the father,

221
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:04,040
he's a young lieutenant
of the occupation army.

222
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,918
Is that so?

223
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,961
My poor Michelle.

224
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,423
But he loves me
and wants to get married --

225
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,051
as soon as he can get permission.

226
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,348
I really can't understand.

227
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,558
How could you fall in love

228
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:27,021
with an enemy of our France?

229
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,107
Love has no country, Leni.

230
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,071
But there's something else
you don't know.

231
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,031
Leni, dear...

232
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,741
I'm working for the resist--

233
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,621
Come in!

234
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,838
For you, madame.

235
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,091
How can you remember all this crap?

236
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,467
You must be making it up.

237
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,470
No! I'm not, I sw--

238
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,140
Well, I embroider a little

239
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,475
so that you can see it the way I do.

240
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,102
God help me.

241
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:10,481
You atheists never stop talking about God.

242
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,942
And you gays never face facts.

243
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,652
Fantasies are no escape.

244
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,028
Whew.

245
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,868
If you've got the keys to that door,

246
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,580
I will gladly follow.

247
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:30,001
Otherwise, I will escape in my own way.

248
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,294
Thank you.

249
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,505
Then your life is as trivial
as your movies.

250
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,885
I'm going to sleep.

251
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,265
Tell the truth.

252
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,768
Who do you identify with the most?

253
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:52,732
The clubfoot patriot
or the handsome Werner?

254
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,360
Who do you identify with?

255
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,325
Oh, the singer.

256
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,160
Mmm.

257
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,078
She's the star.

258
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,831
I'm always...

259
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,167
the heroine.

260
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,864
Have some.
It's delicious.

261
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,199
No, thanks.

262
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,825
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

263
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,120
Sure, I like it, but, no, thanks.

264
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,040
Well, then go ahead and have some.

265
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,750
It's a long time till lunch.

266
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,210
Can't afford to get spoiled.

267
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,212
Do you really think
that eating this avocado

268
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,880
will make you spoiled and weak?

269
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,465
Enjoy what life offers you.

270
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:04,220
What life offers me is the struggle.

271
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,013
When you're dedicated to that,

272
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,598
pleasure becomes secondary.

273
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,308
Does your girlfriend
think the same thing?

274
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,726
How do you know I have a girl?

275
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,563
It's... the normal thing.

276
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,859
Does she avoid pleasure, too?

277
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,653
She knows what really counts.

278
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,405
That the most important thing

279
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,448
is serving a cause that is noble.

280
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,950
What kind of cause is that,

281
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,702
one that doesn't let you eat an avocado?

282
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,245
Molina, you would never understand.

283
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,663
Well, I understand one thing.

284
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,248
I offer you half of my precious avocado

285
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,791
and you throw it back in my face.

286
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,419
Don't act like that!
You sound just like a --

287
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,213
Like a what?
Say it.

288
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,842
Say it.
Like a woman, you mean.

289
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,845
What's wrong with being like a woman?

290
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,015
Why do only women get to be sensitive?

291
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,601
Why not a man?

292
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,937
A dog?

293
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,857
Or a faggot?

294
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,650
If more men acted like women,

295
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,236
there wouldn't be so much violence like that.

296
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,531
- Maybe you have a point.
- Oh!

297
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,283
A flimsy one, but still a point.

298
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,369
Oh, nice!
"Maybe I have a point."

299
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,297
Molina, today's your lucky day.

300
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,841
The warden want to talk to you.

301
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,318
Why did the warden want to see you?

302
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,158
My lawyer called.

303
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,328
Parole seems out of the question.

304
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,332
For a while, at least.

305
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,460
How did he treat you, the warden?

306
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,922
Like a faggot.

307
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,340
Same as always.

308
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,342
Oh, no.

309
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,927
Shit!

310
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,352
He told me something else.

311
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,359
My mother's not doing too well.

312
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,781
She has high blood pressure.

313
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,702
And her heart is kind of weak.

314
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,915
People can go on forever like that.

315
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,292
Sure, but not if you upset them.

316
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,671
Can you imagine the shame
of having a son in prison?

317
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,840
And the reason?

318
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,552
Go to sleep.
You'll feel better.

319
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,388
No.

320
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,391
Only one thing can help.

321
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,104
Sure, man, go ahead.

322
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,356
"Man"?

323
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,401
Is there a man here?
Don't let him go!

324
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,403
Did he get away?

325
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,534
Okay. Cut the crap and tell your movie.

326
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,329
And now...

327
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:22,793
waiting in the moonlight,
behind the cabaret...

328
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,254
is Werner's limousine.

329
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,301
<i>Werner's eyes are locked
on the backstage exit.</i>

330
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:34,346
<i>"La sortie des artistes."</i>

331
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,975
<i>He signals his chauffeur
to open the door for her.</i>

332
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:43,397
<i>Maybe because Leni sees a chance
to help Michelle,</i>

333
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,317
<i>or maybe because Leni wants to know</i>

334
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:50,863
<i>what kind of man is hidden
inside this enemy invader,</i>

335
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,449
<i>she decides...</i>

336
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,452
<i>to join him for the evening.</i>

337
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,337
Madame.

338
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,482
To a great artiste.

339
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:35,866
<i>Michelle hurries
to meet her secret love.</i>

340
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,745
<i>But dark forces have already
decided the fate</i>

341
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,497
<i>of this sweet girl,</i>

342
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,707
<i>this girl from the French Resistance</i>

343
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,503
<i>in love with a German lieutenant.</i>

344
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:51,340
Her time is up.

345
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,508
What?

346
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,511
<i>Because...</i>

347
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,429
Hanson!

348
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,724
<i>love is a luxury</i>

349
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,395
<i>a spy cannot afford.</i>

350
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,070
Michelle, look out!

351
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,464
How can you leave me
sitting there like that,

352
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,467
chattering to myself
like some silly parrot?

353
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,261
Strange.

354
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,807
When Michelle was killed,

355
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,019
I...

356
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,062
It was chilling.

357
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,564
It's just a movie, Valentin,

358
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,482
just one of mother's many stories.

359
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,569
Yeah, but I keep thinking about...

360
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,446
someone I know.

361
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,075
Your girlfriend.
Tell me about her!

362
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,578
My lips are sealed.

363
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,500
It's just that I'm...

364
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:13,088
so helpless in here,
with no way to protect her.

365
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,382
So you have a heart after all.

366
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,010
Mm.

367
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,763
Write to her, 
tell her to stop taking chances.

368
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,930
If you think like that,

369
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,849
you'll never change anything
in this world.

370
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,646
Now look who's living in a fantasy.

371
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,610
You call this fantasy?

372
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,116
I'm so sorry.

373
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,286
Someday the struggle will be won.

374
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,918
Don't worry, Valentin.
You'll have your day.

375
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,547
I'm sure.

376
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,928
Great.
I'm starving.

377
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,686
Here.

378
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,855
No. You take this one.
It has twice as much.

379
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,189
Sure.
Because those bastards

380
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,899
want us to fight over it.
Take it.

381
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,401
No, you need it more than I do.

382
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,819
Please. Please.
To build your strength.

383
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,237
Don't argue.
Take it!

384
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,366
May I have a spoon?

385
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,163
Thanks.

386
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,891
What's the matter?
Afraid of getting fat?

387
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,727
No. 

388
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,815
This glue is not so bad today.

389
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,693
No.

390
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,823
Valentin?

391
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,910
When I said you should write
your girlfriend,

392
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,413
I also meant you should tell her
that you love her.

393
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,500
It's so nice to get a letter
from someone that you love.

394
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,543
Are you crazy?

395
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,254
A letter would be like
denouncing her to them.

396
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,507
The only reason I'm still alive

397
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,759
is because they want
some information from me.

398
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,136
And if anyone tries to save me,

399
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,556
they'd hide my arrest
by killing me on the spot.

400
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,310
Valentin, please.
Just don't say things like that.

401
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,688
The same thing could be happening 
to her right now.

402
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,106
You love her very much, don't you?

403
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,566
Love should always come first.

404
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,610
That's great.
Now I'd like to eat in peace!

405
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:25,531
Don't worry.
I won't disturb you.

406
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,205
Oh.

407
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,797
What is it now?

408
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,174
It's my mother.

409
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,801
She must really be in bad shape,

410
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,427
or she'd come visit me with groceries.

411
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,471
This happened once before.

412
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,973
Sorry to hear that.

413
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,558
Well, I told you she was sick,

414
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,768
but of course you weren't paying
any attention.

415
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,189
But that's not what I'm crying about.

416
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,817
So what is it, for Christ's sake?

417
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,820
Because it's so beautiful...

418
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:09,366
when lovers are together
for a lifetime.

419
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,536
Why is it so impossible?

420
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,123
You got to be crazy crying
about something like that.

421
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:21,753
I will cry about whatever I want to.

422
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:27,426
Valentin, do you think 
you're the only one who's suffered?

423
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:32,848
You think it's easy to find a real man?

424
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,852
One who's humble
and yet has dignity.

425
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,812
How many years
have I been searching?

426
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,648
How many nights?

427
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:45,861
How many faces filled 
with scorn and deceit?

428
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:48,947
<i>I mean, you know,</i> 

429
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,867
<i>working as a window dresser --</i>

430
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,870
<i>enjoyable as it is --</i>

431
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,872
<i>sometimes, at the end of the day,</i>

432
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,874
<i>you wonder what it's all about.</i>

433
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:03,587
<i>You feel kind of... empty inside.</i>

434
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,339
<i>Then one night...</i>

435
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,673
What? 

436
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,092
It's something new
she just invented herself,

437
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,345
which she calls it La Chikka-Chakka.

438
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,639
And she goes, "Chikka-chakka,
chikka-chakka."

439
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,223
And it's an overnight sensation!

440
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,100
Next day she's in all newspaper,

441
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,894
and her husband becomes so jealous

442
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,896
because he thinks she's nuts.

443
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,981
Good evening, gentlemen.

444
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,900
Would you care for the daily special,

445
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,902
or would you like to order <i>a la carte</i>?

446
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,905
I haven't decided yet.

447
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,823
Okay. Right.

448
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,660
<i>My heart was pounding,</i>

449
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:40,207
<i>so afraid that I would be hurt
once again.</i>

450
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,960
Are you ready for me, sir?

451
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,296
Um... what do you suggest?

452
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,924
Well, perhaps the lasagna and antipasto.

453
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,844
Don't you think the lasagna
might be fattening?

454
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,097
Then perhaps the steak and onion soup.

455
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,350
That sounds wonderful.

456
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,351
Right.

457
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,727
- Thank you.
- Okay.

458
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,855
<i>His white tunic, the way he moved,</i>

459
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,733
<i>his sad smile.</i>

460
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:12,572
<i>Everything seemed so perfect,
like in the movies.</i>

461
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:16,034
<i>You have no idea how much trouble 
I went through,</i>

462
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,954
<i>month after month, just to get him 
to go for a walk.</i>

463
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:24,710
<i>But little by little, 
I made him see that I respected him.</i>

464
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,383
Anyway, after more than a year,
we finally became friends.

465
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,260
Jesus, did it take you another year

466
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,761
to get him in the sack?

467
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,264
Are you out of your mind?

468
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,808
Nothing at all happened, ever.

469
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,351
You got to be kidding.

470
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,937
Don't you know anything at all?
He's straight. He's married.

471
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,523
I said to him, 
"Just once. Let's do it just once",

472
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,942
but, uh, he never wanted to.

473
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,986
I don't believe this.

474
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,947
Here I am staying up all night
thinking about your boyfriend.

475
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,575
Sounds like a real bind, Molina.

476
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,536
All you can do is take it like a man.

477
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,915
I take it...

478
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,209
like a woman.

479
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,336
Always.

480
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:13,008
That's why I want a husband
who's the boss.

481
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,843
Did you ever meet his wife?

482
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,387
No.

483
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,015
But when they were on the verge
of splitting up,

484
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,059
God, such illusions I had.

485
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,311
Like what?

486
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,147
That he might come home
and live with me.

487
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,775
With my mother and me.

488
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,528
And I would take care of him...

489
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,949
<i>and help him lose 
that sadness of his forever.</i> 

490
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,951
Well, that's life, Molina.

491
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,119
No, it's a shame.

492
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,704
With your looks and charm,

493
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,956
you should work in a chic restaurant

494
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,334
or in a big luxury hotel,

495
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,836
making three times
what you're getting now

496
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,588
in that stinkhole.

497
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,049
That's not so easy.

498
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:59,179
I know someone who works
in a big hotel on the coast.

499
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,182
He could talk to the manager,

500
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,893
and -- presto -- a new life.

501
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:09,064
And be what,
a busboy in a snob joint?

502
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,732
I would make less money than now.

503
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,069
I could help you with a loan.

504
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:18,073
With your poise,
you'd be a waiter in six months.

505
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:22,077
I don't know.

506
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,537
Of course you do.

507
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,748
In a year,
a maitre d' in a tuxedo. 

508
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,751
You could pay me back in no time.

509
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,253
Maybe.

510
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,089
Anyway, I appreciate your offer.

511
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,173
I'll think about it.

512
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,679
I got to get my bus.
I'm gonna be late.

513
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,097
See you tomorrow.

514
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,516
Bye-bye, Molina.

515
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,476
Good night, Gabriel.

516
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,440
Kiss the children for me.

517
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,710
<i>And then it's over -- again.</i>

518
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:16,131
<i>My dreams disappear...</i>

519
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,967
<i>into the darkness...</i>

520
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:25,140
<i>and I wake up alone...</i>

521
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:28,143
waiting, as always,

522
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,229
waiting and waiting
and waiting and waiting.

523
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,065
Waiting for what?

524
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,151
A man...

525
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,154
Ha ha.
A real man.

526
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,907
But that can't happen
because a real man,

527
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,160
what he wants is a real woman.

528
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,289
Can I ask you a question?

529
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,085
What is a real man in your terms?

530
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,297
Well...

531
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:01,676
to be marvelous-looking and strong,

532
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,553
without making any fuss about it,

533
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,305
and walking very tall
like my waiter.

534
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,432
He just gives you that impression,

535
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,684
but inside it's another story.

536
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,480
In this society,
without power behind you,

537
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,148
no one walks tall.

538
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,775
Don't be jealous.

539
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,193
Don't be stupid.

540
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,946
You see how you react?

541
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,366
There's just no talking 
about a guy with another guy,

542
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,493
without getting into a fuss.

543
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,955
Look, just keep it
at a certain level, okay?

544
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,206
Or let's not talk at all.

545
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:35,543
Okay, you tell me what a real man is.

546
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,879
I don't know.

547
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,883
Sure, you do.
Go ahead, tell me.

548
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,804
Well, not taking any crap from anybody,

549
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,222
not even the powers that be.

550
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,224
That's not the most important thing.

551
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,433
What really makes a man

552
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,560
has to do with not humiliating anybody.

553
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:58,108
It's not letting the people around you 
feel degraded.

554
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,235
That sounds like a saint.

555
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,196
Forget it.

556
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,618
Ohh!

557
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,953
What's wrong?

558
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,247
- My stomach.
- Maybe it's your appendix.

559
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,291
No, I had mine out.
God, it hurts.

560
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,001
You feel like throwing up?

561
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,044
No, it's below there.
It's in my guts.

562
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,965
The food didn't do anything to me.

563
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,343
I don't know.
Maybe it's my ulcer.

564
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,139
I don't like this.

565
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,724
Why don't you go on with your movie?

566
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,268
God! I never felt a pain like this.

567
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,894
Go ahead and tell it.

568
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:40,275
<i>Leni...lingers at the window, 
so sad, so alone,</i>

569
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:44,612
<i>so afraid that she will fall in love...</i>

570
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:50,076
Tonight, the invaders murdered
your friend Michelle.

571
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,411
No!

572
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:56,541
You must complete her mission
and find the secret map

573
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,293
to the German arsenal.

574
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:04,132
Their chief of counterintelligence

575
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,967
is in love with you.

576
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,012
I could never get involved
in such a thing.

577
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:14,517
Nonsense.
Nothing could be safer.

578
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,311
Do you love France?

579
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,855
Of course I do.

580
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:23,109
That Kraut can't keep his hands off you.

581
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:28,323
Next time he touch you like this...

582
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:32,327
and like this,
think of your country

583
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:36,164
and get the map.

584
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,333
Ah.

585
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,669
Aah! Ohh!

586
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,339
Stop her, you idiot!

587
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:54,182
<i>Leni, desperate,</i>

588
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,059
<i>runs along this dark, empty street,</i>

589
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,353
<i>but, furious, 
Clubfoot hobbles after her.</i>

590
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:04,359
Taxi!

591
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,111
<i>When suddenly...</i>

592
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,947
This girl is finished.

593
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,241
What girl?

594
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,369
Me, stupid!

595
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,912
Molina!

596
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,750
Guard! Guard!

597
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,003
Guard!

598
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,404
You're strong enough
to go back to your cell.

599
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,407
Your diarrhea will stop tomorrow.

600
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,993
Till then, no food.

601
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,413
Only water. Clean water.

602
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,789
If you can find it.

603
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,333
Doctor, I need to see the warden 
right away.

604
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,420
That's what they all say.

605
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:25,064
I don't understand how you can 
pass out from an ulcer.

606
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,443
I'm no spring chicken, darling.

607
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:32,447
I'm getting dizzy even looking
at these pictures.

608
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,620
God, wouldn't it be wonderful

609
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,580
if you told me a movie for a change?

610
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:44,000
One that I haven't seen.

611
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,045
I don't remember any.

612
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,464
Don't be like that.

613
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,384
Come on, tell me one.

614
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,386
Please?

615
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,597
Don't be such a crybaby.

616
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,768
Valentin, have you ever loved someone

617
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,478
that you didn't want to love?

618
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:06,481
What do you mean?

619
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,237
Leni didn't want to fall in love
with Werner,

620
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,740
but what could she do?

621
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,452
She steps through his doorway

622
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,580
like a goddess.

623
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,500
<i>Her slim, graceful figure</i>

624
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,502
trembles at the sight of Werner

625
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,754
descending the marble staircase.

626
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,381
Their eyes meet.

627
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,507
Leni says...

628
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,468
My best friend has been killed.

629
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,637
I need a place to stay.

630
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,072
Prepare the guest room.

631
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,328
This music is magical.

632
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,164
I feel like...

633
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,875
I'm floating on air.

634
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,255
<i>But her heart is saying,</i>

635
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,466
<i>"Oh, Werner, you seem like a god,</i>

636
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,468
<i>but your tears...</i>

637
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:21,055
your tears are proof that you have 
the feelings of a man."

638
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,265
Quiet!

639
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,102
I can't hear.

640
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,370
Murderers.

641
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,040
Fascist murderers.

642
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,794
Murderers.

643
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,006
Fascist murderers.

644
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,718
Murderers!

645
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:03,931
Fascist murderers!
Murderers!

646
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,601
Fascist murderers!

647
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,603
Murderers!

648
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:17,612
Murderers!
Fascist mur--

649
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:23,701
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker!

650
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,870
Motherfucker!

651
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:26,996
I'll clean it up.

652
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,417
You son of a bitch.

653
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,003
They're killing one of my brothers, 
and what am I doing?

654
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,799
Listening to your fucking Nazi movie!

655
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,343
Don't you know anything?!

656
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,637
Don't you know what the Nazis
did to people?

657
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,431
Jews! Marxists! Catholics!

658
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,641
Homosexuals!

659
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,017
Of course I know.

660
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,478
What do you take me for,
an even dumber broad than I am?

661
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,481
You son of a bitch!

662
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,650
You don't know shit!

663
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,652
Aah!

664
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,780
You wouldn't know reality
if it was stuck up your ass!

665
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,658
Why should I think about reality
in a stinkhole like this?

666
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,993
Why should I get more depressed
than I already am?

667
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,662
You're worse than I thought.

668
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,789
You just use this movies
to jerk yourself off. 

669
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,792
If you don't stop,
I will never speak to you again!

670
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,001
Stop crying!

671
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,920
You sound just like an old woman!

672
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,922
That's what I am.
That's what I am.

673
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,049
What's this between your legs?! 
Huh?!

674
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,468
Tell me, lady!

675
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,847
It's an accident.

676
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,307
If I had the courage,
I'd cut it off.

677
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,269
You'd still be a man.
A man!

678
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,188
A man in prison!

679
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:38,568
Just like the faggots
the Nazis shoved in the ovens!

680
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,699
Don't look at me like that.

681
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,257
Luis Alberto Molina...

682
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,718
you shall endure the full weight
of the law

683
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,052
and not one day less.

684
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,514
You will be confined
without a chance of parole

685
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,726
for a period of not less
than eight years.

686
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,272
Poor Mama.

687
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:20,026
Her eyes filled with tears
as if someone had died.

688
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,029
<i>A life full of humiliation</i>

689
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,740
<i>and then the humiliation
of a son steeped in vice,</i>

690
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,451
<i>but she never gave me
that black look.</i>

691
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:32,163
<i>Her heart broken
by too much suffering,</i>

692
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,165
<i>too much forgiving.</i>

693
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,086
<i>Because of me she could die.</i>

694
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:53,768
If he ever says 
one unkind word about her,

695
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:57,563
I'll strangle the son of a bitch.

696
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,404
Him and his filthy words

697
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,533
and his piss-ass revolution!

698
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,617
Get me some water!

699
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,286
It's my stomach.

700
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,663
It's like a bomb exploding.

701
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,248
It's the same thing that happened --

702
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,583
I think it's the food.

703
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,376
We got to get to the infirmary
right away.

704
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,794
- Guard!
- No!

705
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,963
Wait! Stop!

706
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,882
I'm a political prisoner.

707
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:48,966
Don't be ridiculous.

708
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,593
This is no time
for your damn discipline.

709
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,219
Get away from the door!

710
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,388
Look at me. They gave me a shot,
and I'm better already.

711
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,890
Are you crazy?
That's what they want.

712
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,141
They'll get me hooked on those shots,

713
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,351
and I'll tell them everything.

714
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,352
What are we going to do?

715
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,686
Just leave me alone.

716
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,902
Oh, God.

717
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:12,949
What about my movie?

718
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,534
It might help you forget the pain.

719
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:19,288
Later that night,
on the moonlit veranda, 

720
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,416
<i>Leni feels so safe,</i>

721
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:26,462
<i>so secure in Werner's arms.</i>

722
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:56,075
<i>Even when the phonograph stops,
they continue dancing.</i>

723
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:01,205
<i>Dancing and dancing.</i>

724
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,957
<i>Dancing.</i>

725
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:09,505
To the music of the evening breezes.

726
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,698
Marta.

727
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,331
Who are you?

728
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,500
It's okay.

729
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,047
There, now.

730
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,007
Try to rest.

731
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:06,062
Marta.

732
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,820
You shouldn't eat this garbage
while you're sick.

733
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:18,574
I have to get my strength back.

734
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,035
It will only make you worse.

735
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:25,456
Tastes like... dog piss.

736
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,168
My poor little Valentina.

737
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:32,588
Don't call me "Valentina".
I'm not a woman.

738
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:37,051
Well, I've never seen proof
to the contrary.

739
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,886
And you never will.

740
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,183
Now, uh, the clubfoot told...

741
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,061
You'll like this part.
Wait and see. 

742
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:50,856
<i>The clubfoot told Leni
that her sweet lover</i>

743
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,943
<i>was ordering the execution
of her countrymen every day.</i>

744
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,112
<i>But she refused to believe it.</i>

745
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,823
<i>She only wanted to live this love,</i>

746
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,243
<i>to feel his touch,
to hear his voice.</i>

747
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,286
<i>It's a difficult decision.</i>

748
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,831
<i>Ja, Herr Kommandant.
We captured 10 of them.</i>

749
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,291
<i>They are all French,
but their activities prove</i>

750
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,085
<i>that they are enemies of the people.</i>

751
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,087
They call themselves patriots,

752
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,422
but in fact they're common criminals.

753
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,799
<i>Jawohl, Herr Kommandant.</i>

754
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,300
<i>Let the execution take place at dawn.</i>

755
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,927
<i>Jawohl.</i>

756
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,097
Her fingers trembled with the agony

757
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,391
of betraying the man that she loves.

758
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:34,650
It's like a nail in my gut!

759
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,157
That's better.

760
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,868
Do me a favor and stop all this crap

761
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,120
about beautiful women in tears?

762
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,710
Leni's heart was beating so fast,

763
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:58,549
that her swelling breasts
leapt out of her low-cut gown,

764
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,093
like luscious <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>
on a silver platter.

765
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,139
Oh, don't make me laugh.
It hurts!

766
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,767
Here.
Have a nice juicy tit.

767
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,147
Have another.

768
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,358
The best places serve them in pairs.

769
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:21,155
The bucket, quick!

770
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,407
Oh, no!

771
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,117
Ah.

772
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,749
Phew. Christ.
What a smell.

773
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,084
I'm sorry.

774
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,544
You don't know how much it hurts.

775
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,922
Just let it all out.

776
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,174
It can't smell any worse
than it already does.

777
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,093
God, I can't stand this.

778
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:46,180
You've been through worse.

779
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,182
Much worse.

780
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,061
I'm so ashamed.

781
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,647
Aren't you the one always saying,
"Take it like a man"?

782
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,398
So what's this business
of being embarrassed?

783
00:53:56,524 --> 00:54:00,110
I can't stand this.
I can't stand myself like this.

784
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,820
Take off your pants.

785
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:05,199
Here.
Come on. Come on.

786
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,410
Cover yourself with this.
Here.

787
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,710
Why do you always have to...

788
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:20,214
pick on yourself so much?

789
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:25,135
That's it. That's it.
This one first.

790
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:29,139
Now this one.
That's it.

791
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:32,142
Okay, now...

792
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,477
wipe yourself off.

793
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,063
No!
It'll -- It's yours.

794
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:39,233
No, it's not.
It's ours.

795
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,360
Wipe yourself.

796
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,995
Okay.

797
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:58,085
There's a little more here...
and here...

798
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,962
Jesus.
Aren't you disgusted?

799
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,506
No, it breaks my heart
to see you like this.

800
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,800
There, almost finished.

801
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,346
Good.
Now take off your shirt.

802
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,806
No. It's all right.

803
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,267
The shirttails are soiled.
Please.

804
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:19,231
There. That's it.
That's it.

805
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:28,615
There we go.
Now just a second.

806
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,286
Okay, now, try to stand up.

807
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,079
No, it'll stink.

808
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:37,041
My weekly shower is tomorrow.

809
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:41,045
I'll have it all clean by noon.

810
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,673
There we go.
There we go.

811
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,383
There we go.

812
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,844
All wrapped up like a little papoose.

813
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,304
It doesn't disgust you?

814
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,347
Lie down.

815
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,727
There we go.

816
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,980
We don't want you to catch a chill.

817
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,359
What a shame I have no talcum left.

818
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,319
There.
Are you comfortable now?

819
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,322
Yeah, but I'm so cold.

820
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,658
I'll make you a nice hot cup of tea.

821
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,969
This will work wonders.
It's hot -- hot, hot.

822
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,429
You'll burn yourself.

823
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,648
You're very kind, honestly.

824
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,441
I don't know what to say.

825
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,235
Don't burn yourself.

826
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:04,920
Oh, um, this...
fell out of your shirt.

827
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:08,757
Go ahead, read it.
I know you've been curious.

828
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,175
No, I only read love letters.

829
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,302
I don't want to know anything
about your politics.

830
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:16,765
It's from my girlfriend.
Her name is Lydia.

831
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,392
What about Marta?

832
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,105
How do you know about Marta?

833
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,315
You mumbled her name in your sleep.

834
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,692
What else did I mumble?

835
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,735
Nothing.

836
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,411
The letter's from Lydia.

837
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,037
She's my girlfriend in the movement.

838
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,207
Her handwriting is like a child's.

839
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,628
She hasn't had much of an education.

840
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:52,342
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

841
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:57,181
During torture, 
whenever I felt close to death,

842
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,142
it was Marta I would think about,

843
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,227
and she would save me.

844
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:05,647
My whole body ached to hold her.

845
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,941
What's she like?

846
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:13,113
She's upper class.

847
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,491
Pure bourgeoisie.

848
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,451
She's got everything.

849
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:22,456
Money, looks, education... freedom.

850
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:26,084
I'm such a hypocrite.

851
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,462
Just like all those class-conscious pigs.

852
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:32,090
I must admit, it was convenient.

853
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:35,886
A safe place to stay

854
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:39,890
while I was forced to hide.

855
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:42,935
<i>Until one day I had to tell her</i>

856
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,479
<i>about my other life.</i>

857
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,985
<i>She just listened in silence
like she knew already.</i>

858
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,488
<i>Then she asked me to leave the movement.</i>

859
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,906
<i>But how could I do nothing</i>

860
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,992
<i>when my friends 
were disappearing every day?</i>

861
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:08,418
<i>I sensed that she was right,
but I had no choice.</i>

862
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:12,005
<i>So once again
I didn't know what to say.</i>

863
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,094
Things are what they are.

864
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:24,643
I'll be back in a few days.
Same as always.

865
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,856
I can't take it anymore.

866
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:34,528
Always waiting, watching the phone.

867
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,905
Always alone.

868
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,648
Valentin...

869
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:16,486
if you leave, don't come back.

870
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:20,699
Please.
Don't come back.

871
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,579
<i>I no longer believed in violence,</i>

872
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,497
<i>but I had to do something.</i>

873
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:28,999
<i>As a journalist,</i>

874
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,793
<i>I was always hearing
about the illegal arrests</i>

875
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,129
<i>and secret torture.</i>

876
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:37,883
<i>Then leaking this information abroad.</i>

877
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,693
<i>My assignment was to meet
one of the last</i>

878
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,947
<i>surviving members of the original movement.</i>

879
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:05,869
<i>His code name was Dr. Americo.</i>

880
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,623
<i>He needed my passport
to leave the country.</i>

881
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,128
Are you all right?

882
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:18,674
A little tired.

883
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,636
You should have left a long time ago, 
Dr. Americo.

884
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,805
This is where I'm needed.

885
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,598
I keep wondering if it's all worth it

886
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,975
when nothing really changes.

887
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:36,900
Well, good luck.
Here's your passport.

888
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:40,570
Take care of yourself.

889
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,656
Thank you.

890
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:49,287
<i>He had accomplished almost nothing,</i>

891
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:54,126
<i>but I was glad I could help him.</i>

892
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:07,806
Freeze!

893
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,683
Stop!

894
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:13,019
Here! Open your legs!
Open your legs!

895
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:20,694
Move!

896
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,032
<i>What happened to Marta?</i>

897
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,869
<i>I don't know anything for sure except...</i>

898
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,705
I'll never see her again.

899
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,583
Don't say that.

900
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:38,211
I don't deserve to die in this cell.

901
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:43,133
I only confessed some code names
they already knew.

902
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:47,429
I can't stand being a martyr.

903
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,098
It infuriates me.

904
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,434
I don't want to be a martyr.

905
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:58,982
My whole life, a mistake.

906
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,525
No.

907
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,822
Give me your hand.

908
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,624
I don't want to die, Molina.

909
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,755
I don't want to die.

910
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,929
Don't let me die.

911
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,764
Of course not.

912
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,186
You look thin, Molina.

913
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,687
What's the matter?

914
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:41,691
It's nothing. I was sick,
but I'm better now.

915
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,026
So stop trembling.

916
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,737
There's nothing to be afraid of.

917
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:51,660
Arregui doesn't suspect anything, does he?

918
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:52,786
No, sir.

919
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,791
What has he told you?

920
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:02,754
Well...

921
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,798
nothing yet.

922
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,092
He...

923
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:10,720
I feel I should proceed very cautiously.

924
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:14,224
Molina, you are lying.

925
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,229
What are you hiding?

926
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,898
Nothing. How can you accuse me
when I almost died for you?

927
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,901
He insisted...
that I eat the bowl with the poison.

928
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,904
Why?
You made a mistake there.

929
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,615
One plate had twice as much
as the other one,

930
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,742
so he insisted I eat
the larger portion.

931
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:36,788
Sir, you told me that the poison food 
would be in a --

932
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,332
in a new tin plate.

933
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:43,670
Well, they loaded it up so much,
I had no choice.

934
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,255
I had to eat it myself

935
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,549
or he would have become suspicious.

936
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,468
Poor Molina.
I'm sorry for the mix-up.

937
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,847
I commend you.

938
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:58,852
Sit down, here.

939
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,645
Please.

940
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,859
Your mother is feeling much better

941
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,903
since she learned you may be paroled.

942
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,279
Really?

943
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,781
Of course, so stop crying.

944
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,533
You should be pleased.

945
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,744
It's from happiness, sir.

946
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:19,122
What did Valentin say about his cadre?

947
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,752
His what?

948
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,087
His group.

949
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:29,758
Who they are.
Where they meet.

950
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,136
Nothing, sir.
He -- He is very sick.

951
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:37,557
If he has any more poison,
I don't know what will happen.

952
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:42,187
His girlfriend.
What did he say about her?

953
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,899
He says that personal things...

954
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,901
are secondary to the revolution.

955
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,904
He thinks everything else is trash, so...

956
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:54,908
I think he's warming up
to talking about it.

957
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,287
For me?

958
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,248
Thank you.

959
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,919
What did he say about the new prisoner?

960
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:07,921
The one across the hall.

961
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:11,925
The one who's all messed up.

962
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:15,136
He said no crime justifies
that kind of punishment.

963
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:18,306
This coffee really hits the spot.

964
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:20,934
Did he tell you his name?

965
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,063
Of course, sir.
It's Valentin Arregui.

966
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,731
No, you idiot!

967
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,945
The name of the new prisoner.

968
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:35,490
Of course not.
He's always wearing a hood.

969
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:38,952
Who put a hood on him?

970
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:42,372
It's routine.
He's political.

971
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,457
How do you expect him to talk

972
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,085
if he can't even see the bastard's face?

973
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:48,753
It won't happen again.

974
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:56,720
Molina, we've got to know everything 
they are planning.

975
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,931
As soon as he sees
that new prisoner's face,

976
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,560
he will spill his guts.

977
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:06,938
Remember every damn word he says.

978
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,399
Yes, sir.

979
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:13,987
The quicker he talks,
the quicker you get out.

980
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:19,993
Now, get back to work.

981
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:26,458
Uh, warden?
Um, one more thing.

982
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:30,920
Um, he heard the guards say
that my mother was coming.

983
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:34,049
And I had told him
that she always brings me

984
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,717
a bag full of groceries,

985
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:39,220
and... I don't want him
to get suspicious.

986
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:43,016
Okay.
Dictate what she brings.

987
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:45,977
To you, sir?

988
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,564
Yeah, to me.
And make it quick. I'm busy.

989
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,071
Um...

990
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,073
Two roast chickens in butter...

991
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,283
um...

992
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,619
egg salad...

993
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,037
canned peaches...

994
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,539
uh...

995
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:10,335
condensed milk,
two bags of -- of tea --

996
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:14,464
one regular and one chamomile...

997
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,716
a jar of pickled herring.

998
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:19,928
Four bars of toilet soap.
What else?

999
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,097
Um...

1000
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,307
Blessed Mary, my mind's a blank.

1001
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,476
What else? Let me think.
Um...

1002
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,063
Uh...

1003
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,358
Rye bread, sugar, I need.
Um...

1004
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:37,695
roast chickens...
canned peaches...

1005
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,949
Cheddar cheese. Mmm.

1006
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,992
Mmm.

1007
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,994
Rye bread.

1008
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,079
What happened?

1009
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,999
Look at this.
Two roast chickens.

1010
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,668
Two!
How about that?

1011
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,628
Just watch how fast you get better now.

1012
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:55,088
Your mother came?

1013
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:58,091
Yes. Tea!

1014
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,093
Um... oh...

1015
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:03,012
sugar.

1016
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,098
And...

1017
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,186
cigarettes.

1018
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:14,232
That's great. How is she?

1019
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:16,693
Oh, she's much better.
Much better. Thank you.

1020
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:21,072
And look...
at all she brought me.

1021
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,866
I mean "us".

1022
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,450
Well, really that's all meant for you.

1023
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,327
No, you have to stop eating
that damn prison chow,

1024
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:27,871
and you'll feel better in no time.

1025
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,080
You think so, huh?

1026
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,081
You're damn right I do.

1027
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,624
Starting today a new life begins.

1028
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,877
Oh, and I took a chance...

1029
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,797
and left the sheets out to dry...

1030
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,633
and no one walked away with them,

1031
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:44,137
so tonight we both have clean sheets.

1032
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:45,430
Nice going.

1033
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:48,099
Just let me get this started and...

1034
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,810
presto.

1035
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:53,146
In a few minutes,
you'll be licking your fingers.

1036
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:55,523
I expect you to eat all of these chickens, 
both of them.

1037
01:09:55,649 --> 01:09:58,151
Well, what about you?

1038
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,904
I'm not gonna just let you 
sit around and drool.

1039
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,781
No, I have to keep an eye
on my girlish figure,

1040
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,783
or at least what's left of it.

1041
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,410
Not yet.
That's for dessert.

1042
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,420
Mmm.

1043
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:19,672
Would you like some more peaches?

1044
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:22,759
No, thanks, I'm stuffed.

1045
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,184
Good food, good cigarette.

1046
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,436
I don't remember when I felt so good.

1047
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:38,441
There's only one thing missing.

1048
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,818
Christ!

1049
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,112
And I thought I was supposed
to be the one

1050
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:45,198
who was the degenerate around here.

1051
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,533
No, no.
I mean a good movie.

1052
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,369
Oh, of course!

1053
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,206
Geez, why didn't I think of that?

1054
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,916
Your Nazi movie.
How does it end?

1055
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:56,209
I thought you hated it.

1056
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,212
Yeah, but I'm curious to see
how it turns out.

1057
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,215
Well, let's see...

1058
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:07,220
<i>They are dining at the majestic table</i>

1059
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,931
<i>in Werner's chateau.</i>

1060
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:13,518
<i>As Werner begins to notice</i>

1061
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:17,313
<i>Leni's cold distance...</i>

1062
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:23,152
she, suddenly, impulsively... 

1063
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:27,824
<i>hurls her wine glass
across the room and says...</i>

1064
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,617
I refuse to love a man

1065
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,495
who is the butcher of my country!

1066
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,085
Oh, my love.

1067
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:43,673
Come with me,
and you will understand.

1068
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:49,595
Werner takes her
to this government archive

1069
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,307
filled with photos and documents

1070
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:56,185
about famine throughout the world.

1071
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,480
<i>He shows her how the elite</i>

1072
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:05,278
<i>create false shortages
to enslave the masses.</i>

1073
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,032
<i>Leni is deeply moved</i>

1074
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:13,786
<i>and begins to see things
through Werner's eyes.</i>

1075
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:17,707
<i>From that moment on,</i>

1076
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:21,836
<i>Leni understood Werner's mission --</i>

1077
01:12:21,962 --> 01:12:26,090
<i>to liberate humanity from injustice</i>

1078
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:28,384
<i>and domination.</i>

1079
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,346
<i>As they leave the baroque archive,</i>

1080
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:35,725
<i>Leni feels the anguish
in her heart being transformed</i>

1081
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,061
<i>back to her previous admiration,</i>

1082
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:41,314
<i>but this time...</i>

1083
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:45,318
<i>with the depth of a love...</i>

1084
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:48,029
<i>reborn.</i>

1085
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:51,199
Oh, my love.

1086
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:55,828
How could I ever have doubted you?

1087
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:59,791
She begs him to forgive her...

1088
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:04,337
and promises to help ensnare his enemies.

1089
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:07,131
She arranges this secret meeting

1090
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:09,884
with the head of the Resistance,

1091
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:12,220
<i>by telling him
that she will give the map --</i>

1092
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:13,346
<i>Remember the map?</i> 

1093
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:17,141
<i>Only to him.</i> 

1094
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,423
I believe this...

1095
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,800
is what you want.

1096
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,302
Yes.

1097
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,304
Well done.

1098
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:04,397
So often, I was tempted to steal it 
from him myself,

1099
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:09,402
but some things are best done by a woman,

1100
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:14,323
a woman who betrays the man she loves.

1101
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:19,412
And there is something else
I have wanted...

1102
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:23,833
almost as much as the map.

1103
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:26,461
What?

1104
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:30,047
You know very well.

1105
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:32,425
Hmm?

1106
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:36,637
I've prepared a lavish banquet for two.

1107
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:38,723
I'm not hungry.

1108
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:40,349
I am...

1109
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,435
for you.

1110
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,449
Aah!

1111
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:11,941
Leni.

1112
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:16,112
<i>Werner hears her sing.</i>

1113
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,866
She sings like never before.

1114
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:24,537
She sings of her eternal love for him

1115
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:28,416
and begs him not to cry,

1116
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:32,545
because her sacrifice was not...

1117
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:34,547
in vain.

1118
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:43,556
The end.

1119
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,604
Well, what'd you think?

1120
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:52,565
You told it well.
Next time, tell one I like.

1121
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:54,609
Come off it.
The love story was divine.

1122
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,902
Forget about the rest.
It's so perfect.

1123
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,195
When Leni...

1124
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,574
What's going on?

1125
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,038
What is it?

1126
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,605
That guy is Americo.

1127
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:33,856
Who?

1128
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:37,234
The man with my passport!

1129
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,611
God.

1130
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,615
They don't know he's here.

1131
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:44,784
Who doesn't know?

1132
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,578
Please, Valentin.
Maybe I can help.

1133
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,775
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?

1134
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,529
Turn the other way, will you?

1135
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:22,655
Why?

1136
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:23,823
Because you'll laugh.

1137
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,825
At what?

1138
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,661
Something on any healthy man,
that's all.

1139
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:31,747
Whoo. A hard-on.

1140
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:35,960
Well, that is healthy.
Shall I close my eyes, too?

1141
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,011
Hey, I missed breakfast.
Why didn't you wake me?

1142
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,222
I told the guard
not to bring us anything

1143
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:49,807
as long as our food holds up.

1144
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:52,685
Damn it, Molina.
Stop running my life for me!

1145
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,361
They already took him away.

1146
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:12,037
I didn't want to wake you.

1147
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:16,041
The water's almost hot
if you want some tea.

1148
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:26,093
Here.

1149
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,723
- Have some cake.
- You eat it.

1150
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:32,475
Oh, come on,
let me spoil you a little.

1151
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,351
Back off, Molina.

1152
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:38,105
It's not my fault
they killed your friend --

1153
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:40,733
Shut up!
You damn faggot!

1154
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:48,741
Look.

1155
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:52,745
Oh! Oh, Luisa.
My favorite friend.

1156
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:49,426
Look... at all the wonderful things 
Mama brought me.

1157
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:52,263
Here's a special treat!

1158
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:59,645
Assorted bonbons.

1159
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:08,821
What's the matter?
You don't like candy?

1160
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:10,948
About the --

1161
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:12,992
this morning.

1162
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,995
Uh, about my temper.
I'm really sorry.

1163
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,454
Oh, nonsense.

1164
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:21,250
It -- It wasn't even you
I was mad at.

1165
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:24,628
I've been thinking
maybe I am mad at you.

1166
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:26,839
Why?

1167
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:29,884
Because you're so kind.

1168
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:33,804
I don't --

1169
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,807
I don't want to feel obligated
to treat you the same way.

1170
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,643
"Unable to take.

1171
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:42,354
Unable to give."

1172
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:55,701
Every day he opens up
more and more with me.

1173
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:59,204
Just give me a few more days.
I'm sure he'll talk.

1174
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:04,043
If he doesn't,
he'll be interrogated again.

1175
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:05,794
And thoroughly this time.

1176
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,379
But he's too weak to be tortured.

1177
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:09,173
And if he drops dead,
we all lose out.

1178
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:11,634
I can't take anybody being nice to me

1179
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,969
without asking anything in return.

1180
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,305
If I'm very nice to you
it's because...

1181
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:18,891
I want your friendship and...

1182
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:21,644
No -- Yeah.

1183
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,354
And...

1184
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,523
Why not say it?
Your affection.

1185
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,817
The same way that I try
to be good to my mother,

1186
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:30,361
who's never harmed anyone

1187
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:33,197
and who accepts me for what I am
and loves me.

1188
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,658
It's...

1189
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:38,911
It's like a gift from heaven...

1190
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:43,123
and the only thing
that keeps me going.

1191
01:22:43,249 --> 01:22:45,459
The only thing.

1192
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:49,421
And you, too,
are a very good person.

1193
01:22:49,547 --> 01:22:50,881
Very selfless and devoted.

1194
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:53,342
Risking your life for your ideals, 
ready to die,

1195
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:55,469
even in here,
for what you believe in.

1196
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,430
Am I embarrassing you?

1197
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:00,265
No.

1198
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:03,978
Well, sir, there might be a way
to speed this up.

1199
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:07,773
I'm not sure, but I'm...

1200
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:09,650
It's just a hunch.

1201
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:11,694
Say it straight, Molina.

1202
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,946
Well, you know how inmates are, sir.

1203
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:18,325
When --
When a cellmate leaves...

1204
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:21,495
they feel all sentimental and helpless.

1205
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:23,288
So, um...

1206
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,332
Well, he's gotten a bit attached to me,

1207
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:27,876
so if he thought
that I was being released,

1208
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:29,503
he's bound to open up and talk,

1209
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:33,340
get a few things off his chest.

1210
01:23:33,466 --> 01:23:34,967
What do you think?

1211
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:40,431
So, that's why I respect you
and like you...

1212
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,558
and hope that you feel
the same way about me.

1213
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,519
So I want us always to be friends.

1214
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:47,271
Sure.

1215
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:50,983
The reason I...

1216
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:53,986
wanted to get this in the open is...

1217
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:56,113
because I may be leaving,

1218
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:57,990
since I just heard from the warden

1219
01:23:58,074 --> 01:23:59,992
that I may be paroled soon.

1220
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:01,827
When?

1221
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:04,663
Tell him that you're up for parole,

1222
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:08,042
that we are going to move you
to another cell in 24 hours.

1223
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:11,128
Yes, sir.

1224
01:24:11,254 --> 01:24:13,422
And this is your last chance,
so get going.

1225
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,382
You've got 24 hours.

1226
01:24:15,508 --> 01:24:17,009
One thing, sir.

1227
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,678
You can't catch a fish without bait.

1228
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:21,555
I, um, I need more food.

1229
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:25,893
This time, sir,
I've prepared a list.

1230
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,105
They'll probably move me
to another cell in 24 hours.

1231
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:32,149
My lawyer says that's the procedure.

1232
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:37,821
I don't want to get my hopes 
up too high.

1233
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:39,490
Do you want an apple?

1234
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:41,825
No, thanks.

1235
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:44,161
I guess I should be happy for you.

1236
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:47,247
I don't know.

1237
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:49,333
Yes. All I wanted in life
was to get out of here

1238
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:50,709
and take care of my mother.

1239
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:53,045
Nothing else mattered,
but now that my wish might be...

1240
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:57,800
Be happy, damn it.
I'd give anything to get out.

1241
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:59,927
But is it fair?

1242
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:02,304
What?

1243
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,681
That I always end up with nothing?

1244
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:07,684
That I don't have anything
truly my own in life?

1245
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:09,061
You've got your mother.

1246
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:11,939
Yes, but listen, though,
she's had a life and lived it.

1247
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:16,610
She had a husband and a son.
But I'm still waiting.

1248
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:17,986
At least she's still alive.

1249
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:21,031
But so am I.

1250
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,699
When is my life supposed to begin?

1251
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:25,077
When do I strike it lucky
and have something for my own?

1252
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,621
Right now you just got lucky.
Take advantage of it.

1253
01:25:27,747 --> 01:25:30,290
You're getting out.

1254
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:35,754
And do what?
Hang out with my friends?

1255
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,384
A bunch of silly old queens like me?

1256
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:43,762
Tell a few jokes till I can't stand 
the sight of them,

1257
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:45,514
because they're a bunch of mirrors

1258
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,517
that send me running for my life.

1259
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:51,728
My life of waiting for nothing?

1260
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,865
Tell a movie.
You'll feel better.

1261
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:14,835
Once upon a time...

1262
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:20,174
in a tropical island far away...

1263
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:26,138
there lived a strange woman.

1264
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:30,058
<i>She wore a long gown</i>

1265
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:32,227
<i>of black lamÃ©</i>

1266
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:36,148
<i>that fit her like a glove.</i>

1267
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:38,567
<i>But the poor thing --</i>

1268
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:43,155
<i>she was caught in a giant spider web</i>

1269
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:46,366
<i>that grew out of her own body.</i>

1270
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:54,166
<i>One day...</i>

1271
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:59,213
<i>a shipwrecked man 
drifted onto the beach.</i>

1272
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:10,933
She fed him
and cared for his wounds.

1273
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:16,521
She nourished him with love
and brought him back to life.

1274
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,568
When he awoke...

1275
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:29,826
he gazed up at the spider woman...

1276
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:32,162
and saw...

1277
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:37,501
<i>a perfect teardrop</i>

1278
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:40,545
<i>slide from under her mask.</i>

1279
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,549
<i>Why is she crying?</i>

1280
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:50,180
I don't know.

1281
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:54,351
Why do you always need explanations?

1282
01:27:54,477 --> 01:27:59,314
Valentin, I'm so tired.
I'm tired of suffering.

1283
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,108
You're not the only one they've hurt.

1284
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:02,859
You don't know.

1285
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:08,907
I hurt so much inside.

1286
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:11,243
Where does it hurt you?

1287
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,246
In my neck and shoulders.

1288
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:18,000
Why does the sadness 
always jam up in the same spot?

1289
01:28:20,336 --> 01:28:22,921
Please don't touch me.

1290
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:32,264
Can't a friend even pat your back?

1291
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:35,475
It only makes it worse.

1292
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:37,519
Why?

1293
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:42,983
'Cause I've fallen in love with you.

1294
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:51,283
I'm sorry, Valentin.
I wish it hadn't happened.

1295
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:59,916
I understand.
Don't be ashamed.

1296
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,522
Can I touch you?

1297
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:28,528
If it doesn't disgust you,
I'd like you to.

1298
01:29:48,674 --> 01:29:52,177
Can I touch your scar?

1299
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:54,471
Sure.

1300
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:56,723
Oh.

1301
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:29,005
Do what you want with me
because that's what I want.

1302
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:31,591
If it doesn't disgust you.

1303
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:36,346
Okay.

1304
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:59,161
You are so kind to me.

1305
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,580
No.

1306
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:04,416
You're the one who's kind.

1307
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:33,570
Wait, I'm squeezed against the wall.

1308
01:31:33,696 --> 01:31:36,448
That's better.

1309
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:39,576
No, wait, let me lift my legs.

1310
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:50,879
You know, when I woke up,
I put my hand to my eyebrow...

1311
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:53,340
to feel my scar.

1312
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:54,758
You don't have one.

1313
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:58,470
Like I wasn't me anymore.
As if somehow...

1314
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:01,014
I was you.

1315
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:06,436
Look, let's not talk about this.

1316
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:10,106
Let's not talk about anything at all.

1317
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:12,943
Just for this morning,
I'm asking.

1318
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:17,489
Aren't you going to ask me why?

1319
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:19,491
Why?

1320
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:22,369
Because I'm happy.

1321
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,955
I'm really happy,
and I don't want to spoil it.

1322
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:33,171
The nicest thing about feeling happy...

1323
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:39,553
is that you think you'll never feel 
unhappy again.

1324
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:47,519
You shit-face motherfuck.

1325
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,645
Talk!

1326
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:53,275
Let me handle this.

1327
01:32:56,195 --> 01:32:58,363
Look at me, Molina.

1328
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:05,912
What's the matter?

1329
01:33:06,038 --> 01:33:08,373
You're afraid this group will kill you?

1330
01:33:08,499 --> 01:33:09,874
Is that it?

1331
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:13,253
No, sir, I want to help.

1332
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:14,588
So what did he say?

1333
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:18,550
Nothing.

1334
01:33:20,511 --> 01:33:22,804
Wouldn't it be worse
if I told you something

1335
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:25,557
that was not true?

1336
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:31,479
I'll have to move you
to another cell, Molina.

1337
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:32,897
No, sir, please don't do that.

1338
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:34,399
As long as I'm with him,

1339
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:37,152
there's still a chance
that he might talk.

1340
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:42,115
You faggot piece of shit!

1341
01:33:42,241 --> 01:33:46,703
You fell in love with that bastard!

1342
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:51,374
Okay, Molina.
You can go.

1343
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:56,296
Get your things ready.
You're leaving today.

1344
01:33:56,422 --> 01:33:57,505
Here.

1345
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:02,594
The minister approved your parole.

1346
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,471
Oh. God.
Thank you, sir.

1347
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:07,932
Thank you.

1348
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:16,524
And no more hanky-panky
with the little boys.

1349
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:18,485
Oh, no, sir.
I swear.

1350
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:25,492
They --
They would never suspect you.

1351
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:28,119
I mean, really,

1352
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:29,663
there's no risk at all.

1353
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:31,206
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

1354
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:33,541
I'm --
I'm just too afraid.

1355
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:36,419
All you have to do
is give them a message...

1356
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:37,796
from any public phone.

1357
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,298
No. No names.
No phone numbers. Nothing.

1358
01:34:40,424 --> 01:34:43,218
I'm terrified of the police.

1359
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:45,637
Okay.

1360
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:50,642
I guess I shouldn't drag you into this.

1361
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:55,605
I swear, Valentin.

1362
01:34:55,690 --> 01:35:01,236
My only desire 
is to stay here with you.

1363
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,655
Take care of yourself.

1364
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:14,541
Valentin, I've only ever loved
two people in my life.

1365
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:16,167
My mother and you.

1366
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:19,087
I'm gonna miss you, Molina.

1367
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:32,308
At least the movies.

1368
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:35,687
Yeah.
Whenever I go to sleep,

1369
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:38,231
I'll probably be thinking
of you and your...

1370
01:35:38,357 --> 01:35:40,024
crazy movies.

1371
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:46,489
Whenever I see bonbons,
I'll be thinking of you.

1372
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:49,951
Valentin, there's something
I'd like to ask you

1373
01:35:50,077 --> 01:35:52,162
that you've never done,
although we've done much more.

1374
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:57,041
A kiss.

1375
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:01,838
Okay, but first promise me something.

1376
01:36:01,964 --> 01:36:04,299
I told you I can't,
and I'm so sorry.

1377
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:06,968
No, no, no, no, no.

1378
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:12,724
Promise me you will never let
anybody humiliate you again.

1379
01:36:12,808 --> 01:36:16,394
That you'll make them respect you.

1380
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:19,272
Promise me you'll never let
anybody exploit you again.

1381
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:22,400
Nobody has the right to do that to anybody.

1382
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:27,739
I promise.
Thank you.

1383
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:33,745
Valentin?

1384
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:42,712
What? The kiss?

1385
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:45,256
No. The...

1386
01:36:45,382 --> 01:36:47,550
The phone number.

1387
01:36:58,562 --> 01:37:03,566
Wait a few days.
Dial two times, then hang up.

1388
01:37:03,692 --> 01:37:05,610
The third time...

1389
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,481
Molina. Let's go.

1390
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:53,825
Wait.

1391
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:02,166
Good luck, Molina.

1392
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:03,543
Come on.

1393
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:08,983
A beer.

1394
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:27,085
<i>Subject was granted a special parole</i>

1395
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:28,920
<i>by the minister of justice</i>

1396
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:32,465
<i>on orders from the Department
of Political Surveillance.</i>

1397
01:39:32,591 --> 01:39:35,927
<i>The department believes
he will lead our agents</i>

1398
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:38,721
<i>to the cadre of Valentin Arregui.</i>

1399
01:40:35,946 --> 01:40:39,115
Mama?

1400
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:22,116
Whoo-hoo! Luisa!

1401
01:41:22,242 --> 01:41:24,744
Look who's here.

1402
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:27,705
Nice to see you!

1403
01:41:27,831 --> 01:41:32,043
The return of the leopard woman!

1404
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:36,798
Don't pay attention to them.
You look great!

1405
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:39,717
10 years younger, darling.
Doesn't she?

1406
01:41:39,843 --> 01:41:42,261
Let's watch the show.

1407
01:42:00,906 --> 01:42:04,117
Oh, shut up,
you bunch of faggots!

1408
01:42:04,243 --> 01:42:08,996
Now I would like to welcome home
a very dear friend,

1409
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:10,832
a cherished sister,

1410
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:14,836
who spent Lord knows
how many precious nights

1411
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:19,090
to pay a stupid debt
to this hypocritical society.

1412
01:42:19,174 --> 01:42:23,886
This is for you, lovely Luisa.

1413
01:43:02,634 --> 01:43:06,429
<i>Surveillance reveals subject 
has not returned to work</i>

1414
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:08,848
<i>and almost never leaves home.</i>

1415
01:43:08,974 --> 01:43:12,143
<i>He spends his evenings

1416
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:15,146
<i>for no apparent reason.</i>

1417
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:20,067
You sure you won't eat something?

1418
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:21,694
Just coffee.

1419
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:24,530
You want to talk, Molina?
Is there something wrong?

1420
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:29,368
No, I'm just not going
to see you for a while.

1421
01:43:29,494 --> 01:43:30,912
I'm going away.

1422
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:34,832
With another boy?

1423
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:38,044
That's good.

1424
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:40,087
Don't get arrested again.

1425
01:43:40,172 --> 01:43:42,381
You're too old for it.

1426
01:45:25,861 --> 01:45:29,113
I have a message from Valentin Arregui.

1427
01:45:31,283 --> 01:45:33,409
Yes, a pay phone.

1428
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:41,751
Excuse me, is that really necessary?

1429
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:49,383
Um, all right.

1430
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:51,844
Um...

1431
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:54,263
I'll be wearing a red scarf.

1432
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:01,312
You don't have to close the account.

1433
01:46:01,313 --> 01:46:03,272
There's no penalty if you maintain --

1434
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:05,483
Yes. Thank you.
Do you have an envelope, please?

1435
01:46:06,693 --> 01:46:08,319
Thank you.

1436
01:46:16,661 --> 01:46:19,413
Now, this...

1437
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:22,333
is for Mama.

1438
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:24,960
To take care of her while I'm gone.

1439
01:46:25,087 --> 01:46:26,629
Please.

1440
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:31,884
All right, I'll handle it.

1441
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:36,347
Wherever you're going,
it's probably for the best.

1442
01:46:57,369 --> 01:47:00,454
Mama, you look so beautiful.

1443
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:07,044
Remember, Mama, when I was little

1444
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:09,463
and you used to come into my room

1445
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:11,090
and kiss me good night.

1446
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:12,967
I always pretended to be asleep,

1447
01:47:13,093 --> 01:47:16,387
but I was always waiting for your kiss.

1448
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,015
And though you're sleeping now,

1449
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:22,393
I know you understand me.

1450
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:34,321
It's time for me
to take care of my own life.

1451
01:47:39,786 --> 01:47:42,538
You understand, don't you, Mama?

1452
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:53,090
Don't be sad.

1453
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:42,843
Go that way.
Move, quick.

1454
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:31,266
Who are you?

1455
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:33,852
I have a message from Valentin.

1456
01:51:33,978 --> 01:51:34,853
Are you Lydia?

1457
01:51:34,979 --> 01:51:36,647
Yes. Get in quick.

1458
01:51:36,773 --> 01:51:37,731
Get him!

1459
01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:49,743
Molina! Stop!

1460
01:51:51,538 --> 01:51:52,663
Stop, Molina!

1461
01:52:39,043 --> 01:52:42,045
Get the car.
Move. Hurry!

1462
01:52:53,349 --> 01:52:56,727
Stand up. Move.
Get in the car!

1463
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:02,733
The number.

1464
01:53:02,734 --> 01:53:05,527
Tell me the telephone number,

1465
01:53:05,653 --> 01:53:08,155
and you go to the hospital.

1466
01:53:11,034 --> 01:53:13,744
Talk, you fucking fag!

1467
01:53:13,745 --> 01:53:16,789
The number!

1468
01:53:45,068 --> 01:53:48,779
<i>Subject was shot to death
by the extremists.</i>

1469
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,197
<i>His recent activities,</i>

1470
01:53:50,323 --> 01:53:52,699
<i>such as closing his bank account,</i>

1471
01:53:52,784 --> 01:53:56,787
<i>suggest that he planned
to escape with them.</i>

1472
01:53:56,788 --> 01:53:58,789
<i>Also the way he was shot</i>

1473
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,707
<i>seems to indicate that he had agreed,

1474
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:04,795
<i>if necessary, to be eliminated by them.

1475
01:54:04,796 --> 01:54:08,006
<i>In any case, it appears that
he was more deeply involved</i>

1476
01:54:08,132 --> 01:54:09,925
<i>than we suspected.</i>

1477
01:54:15,765 --> 01:54:16,849
This is morphine.

1478
01:54:18,852 --> 01:54:21,937
So you can get some rest, okay?

1479
01:54:22,063 --> 01:54:24,940
Oh, my God.

1480
01:54:25,066 --> 01:54:26,984
The way they worked you over.

1481
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,820
Okay.

1482
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:33,156
Just don't tell anyone about this, 
or I'll lose my job.

1483
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:38,829
Just count to 40
and you'll be asleep.

1484
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:00,851
<i>Marta...</i>

1485
01:55:04,856 --> 01:55:09,067
Come, Valentin.
Come with me.

1486
01:55:09,193 --> 01:55:13,488
Don't be afraid.
You won't wake up in the cell.

1487
01:55:28,296 --> 01:55:30,422
<i>What about Molina?</i>

1488
01:55:30,548 --> 01:55:33,592
<i>Come, my love.</i>

1489
01:55:33,718 --> 01:55:40,557
<i>Only he knows
if he died happy or sad.</i>

1490
01:55:55,865 --> 01:55:59,284
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1491
01:55:59,410 --> 01:56:01,954
<i>That's the one thing
I never said to you</i>

1492
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,915
<i>because I was afraid
of losing you forever.</i>

1493
01:56:20,932 --> 01:56:24,851
<i>That can never happen now.</i>

1494
01:56:24,936 --> 01:56:28,188
<i>This dream is short...</i>

1495
01:56:28,314 --> 01:56:32,484
<i>but this dream is happy.</i>
