00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,779
<i>~ Risin' up ~</i>

2
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,348
<i>~ Back on the street ~</i>

3
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:06,249
<i>~ Did my time, took my chances ~</i>

4
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,325
<i>~ Went the distance,</i>
<i>now I'm back on my feet ~</i>

5
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,613
<i>~ Just a man and his will to survive ~</i>

6
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:19,422
<i>~ So many times, it happens too fast ~</i>

7
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:23,304
<i>~ You change your passion for glory ~</i>

8
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,035
<i>~ Don't lose your grip</i>
<i>on the dreams of the past ~</i>

9
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,073
<i>~ You must fight just to keep them alive ~</i>

10
00:01:32,247 --> 00:01:36,516
<i>~ It's the eye of the tiger,</i>
<i>it's the thrill of the fight ~</i>

11
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:41,016
<i>~ Risin' up to the challenge of our rival ~</i>

12
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:45,381
<i>~ And the last known survivor</i>
<i>stalks his prey in the night ~</i>

13
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:52,644
<i>~ And he's watchin' us all</i>
<i>in the eye of the tiger ~</i>

14
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:58,693
- Come on! We made a deal.
- I know, but it's extremely crazy.

15
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:02,279
It's mentally irregular, but
it makes all the sense in the world.

16
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:05,120
- You owe me a favour.
- I know, but...

17
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:08,537
- When did you think of this?
- About three years ago.

18
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:13,464
- This is very crazy, Apollo.
- Stallion, when you won that last fight,

19
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:16,131
you won by one second.
You beat me by one second.

20
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:19,133
That's very hard for a man
of my intelligence to handle.

21
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,052
Didn't you say you learned
how to live with it?

22
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,224
- I lied.
- Oh, you lied?

23
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,604
Oh! So now you just gotta
prove it to yourself, right?

24
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:30,816
Just for myself. No TV,
no newspapers - just you and me.

25
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:33,565
Nothin' - just you and me.
Age before beauty.

26
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:37,231
- Anything you say.
- I do all the work. OK.

27
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:41,661
I tell you, Apollo, you'd better go slow.
You ain't as young as springtime no more.

28
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:45,999
- I'm still young enough to whip <i>your</i> butt.
- Oh, yeah? How you gonna do that?

29
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:49,626
- You taught me everything you know.
- <i>Almost</i> everything.

30
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:54,298
You gotta remember: You fight great,
but <i>I'm</i> a great fighter. You ready?

31
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,510
- Absolutely.
- You know, Stallion,

32
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,344
it's too bad we gotta get old, huh?

33
00:03:02,643 --> 00:03:05,099
Oh, just keep punchin', Apollo.

34
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:10,439
- Wanna ring the bell?
- All right.

35
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:13,059
Ding, ding.

36
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:15,735
Come on, Stallion.

37
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:18,524
Come on, come on.

38
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,075
Boy, you really move
good for an older guy.

39
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:24,244
- Look at him fly.
- Look out now.

40
00:03:24,415 --> 00:03:26,621
No, you don't want any of this.

41
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,582
- Come on.
- Maybe I'm in here with the wrong guy.

42
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:54,902
Dad, you're late. Mom's gonna yell at you.

43
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,070
- So how you doin'?
- Fine.

44
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,035
You know, don't you think
that's a little bright?

45
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:03,866
- A little bit?
- Where'd you get that hat?

46
00:04:03,997 --> 00:04:07,781
- A friend gave it to me. Like it?
- Who punched you in the eye?

47
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:12,576
- Same friend.
- That's weird. Better hurry, Dad.

48
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:15,917
You know, you're developin'
a very, very loud personality.

49
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:19,502
Don't go too fast,
or you're gonna get out of focus.

50
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:21,677
Oh, really?

51
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:29,101
- Yo!
- Yo. It's about time.

52
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:31,057
I'm sorry I'm late.

53
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:34,810
- Why don't you go and get ready to eat?
- Great. You're here.

54
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:38,646
- Now you can stop calling him names.
- You been callin' me names?

55
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,356
We wait any longer,
it'll be my next birthday.

56
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:44,364
- Where have you been?
- Oh, gettin' punched.

57
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:47,663
Bring the cake in and we can
get this celebration under way.

58
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:50,958
- Boy, am I hungry.
- Baby, why don't you get the cake?

59
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,708
We got a great surprise.
You're gonna love this cake.

60
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,165
- And your present.
- Where is it?

61
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,965
Let me set the mood. I gotta turn
the lights down and everythin'.

62
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:02,421
- Watch this.
- Is it parked outside?

63
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:05,226
Just be patient, would ya?

64
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:08,222
I'm so excited, I'm startin' to sweat.

65
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:13,182
I feel like I'm gettin' ready to go into
a big fight or somethin'. Watch this.

66
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:24,990
<i>Happy birthday, Paulie.</i>

67
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:38,093
- What the hell is this?
- Your present.

68
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:41,801
I wanted a sports car for my birthday,
not no walkin' trash can!

69
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,015
- Come on! He looks great.
- This is extremely psycho.

70
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:47,633
You have no friends,
so we thought you'd like it.

71
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:50,687
Pretend you're happy.
It'll keep you company.

72
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:53,435
- That's a great-lookin' guy.
<i>- Please make a wish.</i>

73
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,441
It's creepy! It talks!

74
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:58,653
Creepy? I wish I had one of these
when I was growin' up.

75
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,446
- Go on, make a wish, like he says.
- I wish I wasn't in this nightmare.

76
00:06:02,576 --> 00:06:05,197
Very classy wish. What do you think?

77
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:07,864
Very good, huh?

78
00:06:07,998 --> 00:06:10,323
You wanna help me
put out this forest fire?

79
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:13,792
- Sure.
- OK. On the count of three. One...

80
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:15,960
two... three!

81
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:22,922
- Well, they're out.
- You "drownded" me!

82
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:28,342
<i>Oh, don't worry.</i>
<i>I'll clean it up for you, Paulie.</i>

83
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:36,100
- Rocky!
- Yeah, you noticed.

84
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:38,691
What are you doing with that cake?

85
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:43,282
The party ain't over yet, you know.
We still gotta celebrate some more.

86
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:46,613
- It's a special night.
- Yeah, it's Wednesday.

87
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:49,415
It's Wednesday, but in case you forgot,

88
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,752
it's almost been nine years since
you've been married to me, so...

89
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,918
here's your prize.

90
00:06:56,047 --> 00:07:00,958
- But our anniversary's a week away.
- That's true, but... why wait?

91
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:04,628
- Has it been that rough?
- No, no.

92
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:08,466
I tell you, it's been excellent.
Open your prize. Go on.

93
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,436
- Go on, open your prize.
- OK.

94
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:16,600
- Do you like it?
- It's beautiful.

95
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,024
All right!

96
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:22,488
I was so nervous. I didn't know.
I... I hope you like it.

97
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:27,410
The guy I bought it from says even if
it looks like a snake, don't worry,

98
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:29,910
cos it won't bite you.

99
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,825
It's beautiful.

100
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:36,453
You know what's amazing?

101
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,918
That after all these years,
everything still seems kinda new.

102
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:45,552
You remember a long time ago
I told you that...

103
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:50,094
I said that you ain't never
gettin' rid of me. Remember that?

104
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,512
Well, you're not.

105
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:57,104
You're never gettin' rid of me.

106
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,693
Happy "almost anniversary".

107
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:19,458
- A few questions, please.
- How long are you here for?

108
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:22,212
- We talk later.
- When are you gonna fight, Drago?

109
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:23,921
We talk later.

110
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:28,466
Is it definite that the Soviet Union
will enter professional boxing?

111
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,183
No more talk now.
We will talk at press conference.

112
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:38,976
<i>~ Oh, golden dishes</i>
<i>from Church's and catfish at Church's ~</i>

113
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,610
<i>~ Have some catfish from</i>
<i>Church's Fried Chicken ~</i>

114
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,195
<i>~ Catfish from Church's! ~</i>

115
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:48,655
<i>Today may be a landmark</i>
<i>in sports history.</i>

116
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:52,998
<i>After unravelling years of red tape,</i>
<i>Russia will throw its hat into the ring -

117
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:57,371
<i>the prize ring. The introductions were</i>
<i>made by his wife, Ludmilla Vobet Drago -

118
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,413
<i>gold medallist in swimming.</i>

119
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:03,592
<i>Today the Soviet Union has officially</i>
<i>entered professional boxing.</i>

120
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:07,966
<i>My husband and great undefeated</i>
<i>heavyweight world amateur champion,</i>

121
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:12,096
<i>Captain Ivan Drago, has come here</i>
<i>with his trainers to America</i>

122
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:16,641
<i>to compete as an international</i>
<i>sportsman and ambassador of goodwill.</i>

123
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:19,182
<i>Has he boxed against a professional?</i>

124
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:24,111
<i>From having been trained in Russia</i>
<i>by great boxing coach Manuel Vega,</i>

125
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,368
<i>and now by Sergei Rimsky,</i>
<i>we hope he's qualified to do so.</i>

126
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:30,653
<i>- Hope?</i>
<i>- Well, I know he is,</i>

127
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:33,872
<i>but I don't want to sound too confident.</i>

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,994
<i>We would like an exhibition bout with</i>
<i>your famous champion, Rocky Balboa.</i>

129
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,499
<i>You think he can fight</i>
<i>someone as seasoned as Balboa?</i>

130
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:46,845
<i>There is no one who can match his</i>
<i>strength, endurance or aggressiveness.</i>

131
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:49,213
<i>You make him sound indestructible.</i>

132
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:51,140
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

133
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:55,395
<i>Can this mammoth Russian,</i>
<i>nicknamed the Siberian Express,</i>

134
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:58,606
<i>wreak havoc among</i>
<i>the professional heavyweight ranks?</i>

135
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:01,900
<i>Whoever he fights first,</i>
<i>it'll be one hot ticket.</i>

136
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:05,813
<i>We'll be right back with a check on</i>
<i>today's pro football sports scoreboard.</i>

137
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:09,115
Dad, when can I learn to fight?

138
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:12,530
- I can't hear you. What?
- I wanna learn to fight.

139
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,585
Yo. Could you turn your robot down?

140
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:20,622
You see, I fight so you don't have to fight.

141
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:25,382
I want you to use your head for somethin'
instead of a punchin' bag, like I do.

142
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,761
Your head doesn't look
like a punching bag.

143
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,759
No? That's nice. Thanks a lot.

144
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:34,134
It looks like a catcher's mitt!

145
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,187
Oh! A wise guy, huh?

146
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:39,889
Mr Balboa! Mr Creed's on the phone.

147
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,567
- Yeah? I'll be right there.
<i>- You can get it right here.</i>

148
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:47,823
- I hope it's not another rematch.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

149
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,820
Hello? Yeah, Apollo... Turn that down.

150
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:55,865
Apollo, how ya doin'? Yeah?
You're comin' out? That's great.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,085
What am <i>I doin'? I'm just gettin' dizzy.

152
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:07,301
My husband and I thank you for
coming to our training quarter today.

153
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:11,675
As you can see, it is highly advanced,
and we wish to show the American press

154
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:15,259
a small portion of the advances
our country has made

155
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:17,637
in the technology of human performance.

156
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:21,141
Coach Rimsky, what does this do
to enhance performance?

157
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:23,315
- Well...
- If I may answer.

158
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:27,153
It makes a man a better man,

159
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:31,860
a great athlete a superathlete,
by harnessing all his strength.

160
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:35,079
Though most of the world is
ignorant in body chemistry,

161
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:39,952
- we wish to... educate your country.
- There have been rumours of doping,

162
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:44,166
and widespread distribution of
anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union.

163
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:49,175
- Has Drago partaken in any experiments?
- No! Ivan is naturally trained.

164
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:52,389
Then how do you explain
his... freakish strength?

165
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:55,850
Like your Popeye,
he ate his spinach every day.

166
00:11:58,981 --> 00:12:02,184
- Shall we have a demonstration?
- Please do.

167
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:08,280
A normal heavyweight averages
700 pounds of pressure per square inch.

168
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,085
As you can see,
Drago averages 1850 pounds.

169
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,041
- So the result's quite obvious.
- And what results are those?

170
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:31,094
Whatever he hits, he destroys.

171
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:37,175
I've seen Drago fight when he was an
amateur. He's big and strong, but clumsy.

172
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:39,768
I know I can beat him.

173
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:44,441
- Why do you wanna fight again?
- Let's just say it's somethin' <i>I believe in.

174
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,813
- You can do your homework.
- OK. Later, Dad. Later, Uncle Paulie.

175
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,988
- Later, Apollo.
- Later, big man.

176
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:54,368
See you later, kiddo.
Don't you think people are expectin'

177
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:59,952
- to see Rocky whack this bum out first?
- Yeah. And he will, when it's for real.

178
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:03,536
- This is an exhibition bout. Kids' stuff.
- What's the purpose?

179
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:07,883
What at this point in your life
is worth getting hurt for?

180
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:11,592
<i>~ Double or nothin',</i>
<i>you've gotta have a partner... ~</i>

181
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:14,391
- What the hell is that?
- That's my girl.

182
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,636
<i>~ Takin' and givin',</i>
<i>it's time we started livin'... ~</i>

183
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:23,685
- Thanks, honey.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

184
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:27,601
- That's a nice song.
<i>- It's my favourite. You're the greatest.</i>

185
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:30,360
<i>See you, sport.</i>

186
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,860
- See you.
- Paulie, who taught it to talk like that?

187
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:36,827
She loves me.

188
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:41,249
<i>~ You stepped out of the night... ~</i>

189
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:47,919
Like I was sayin', I don't want this chump
to come over here with all that hype,

190
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,051
tryin' to make us look bad.
They try every other way.

191
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:55,840
With Rock's help, we can get great
media coverage. We make <i>them</i> look bad.

192
00:13:55,975 --> 00:13:59,225
- I think it's wrong.
- No. It's never been more right.

193
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:02,520
You're a great fighter,
but you've been retired five years.

194
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:05,353
Isn't it time to start
thinking about something else?

195
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:08,521
How much can you take? Either of you?

196
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:14,030
I'll... get the coffee.

197
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,288
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

198
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:21,871
I just care about you both. I...

199
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:29,129
You ever try these comics?

200
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,339
- No, no.
- Keeps your fertility.

201
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:35,973
Hey, Paulie.

202
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:40,596
<i>In the ring now... Rocky's holding that</i>
<i>right hand. He's fighting right-handed!</i>

203
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:43,054
Oh, now this was a great fight.

204
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,977
Great! I'm gettin' punchy just watchin' it!

205
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:49,692
<i>Mamma mia!</i> What you usin'
for a chin there, Stallion?

206
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:55,530
- I should've slipped that one.
- You definitely should've slipped that.

207
00:14:55,661 --> 00:15:00,738
It's crazy how people just care about you
in that ring and when you're bleedin',

208
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:03,626
but once you step out,
you're ancient history.

209
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:05,709
It ain't ancient history.

210
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:09,538
I don't see anybody askin'
for autographs, do you?

211
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,886
Hey, Apollo... Can I... ask you somethin'?

212
00:15:14,638 --> 00:15:16,180
What?

213
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:20,885
Well, this fight you're havin' against
the Russian. Do you think maybe...

214
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,060
it ain't against him?

215
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:27,438
If it's not him, Stallion,
then who's it against?

216
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:32,693
Well, do you think maybe it's, like...
you against you? What do you think?

217
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:36,240
You know, I think you really
<i>are</i> gettin' brain-damaged.

218
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:40,319
Maybe, but... really.
I'm speakin' the truth here, Apollo.

219
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:43,126
- Are you?
- Yeah.

220
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:49,124
- I don't think I wanna hear this, Stallion.
- Hey, Apollo, you were a great fighter,

221
00:15:49,257 --> 00:15:52,127
but, look, we gotta face the facts too.

222
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,012
You don't wanna believe it,
but maybe the show is over.

223
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:58,258
That's easy for you to say.
You're still on top.

224
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:01,096
What happens when
you're not on top? Then what?

225
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:04,976
Where do we go, Stallion?
Cos we sure as hell can't be born again.

226
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:10,148
I know we can't be born again, but, let's
face it, we... we gotta change sometime.

227
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:12,816
I don't wanna change! I like who I am!

228
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:15,819
I like who you are, too, but look at that.

229
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:18,738
That ain't us up there no more, Apollo.

230
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:21,741
We can't do that the way we did it before.

231
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:25,574
We're changin'. We're, like,
turnin' into regular people.

232
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:28,914
No, Stallion!
Maybe you <i>think</i> you're changin'.

233
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:34,290
But you can't change what you really are.
You can forget all this money and stuff.

234
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,468
Cos it don't change a thing.

235
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:40,595
You and me, we don't even have a choice.

236
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:46,266
We're born with a killer instinct that you
can't just turn off and on like some radio.

237
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:50,230
We <i>have</i> to be right in the middle of
the action, cos we're the warriors.

238
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:53,148
Without some challenge,
some damn war to fight,

239
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,780
then the warrior may
as well be dead, Stallion.

240
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:01,993
So I'm askin' you,

241
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,288
as a friend,

242
00:17:08,712 --> 00:17:11,917
stand by my side this one last time.

243
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:17,342
You're a great talker, Apollo.

244
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:23,178
All right, but... when this is over?

245
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:28,514
You know me, Stallion.

246
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,106
I always think of somethin' else.

247
00:17:31,444 --> 00:17:35,656
That's what I'm afraid of.
All right. You got a deal there.

248
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:38,487
I feel sorry for that guy, you know?

249
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:42,820
What made you decide to put on
an exhibition fight with Drago?

250
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:45,743
Let's call it a sense of responsibility.

251
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,915
Responsibility, how?

252
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:51,544
I had to teach this young fella
to box - American style!

253
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:54,709
Isn't Drago a little inexperienced
to be in the same ring?

254
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:58,461
Well, you know, some folks
got to learn the hard way!

255
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:03,342
- No quick knockout predictions?
- No. I'm not angry with him.

256
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:08,305
I just wanna show the whole world that
Russia doesn't have all the best athletes.

257
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:11,774
Rocky, how do you think
Apollo should fight Drago?

258
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:17,324
Well, personally, I think the first thing
you'd better get Apollo is a ladder.

259
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:22,910
Drago, how does it feel to spar
with the great former champion?

260
00:18:24,332 --> 00:18:28,164
The man's tongue didn't
come through customs.

261
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:32,214
My husband is very happy
to have this opportunity.

262
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,127
- It's his dream.
- Dream? How do you mean?

263
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:39,304
In our country, Apollo Creed is
well known and very respected.

264
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,009
- It could be a good victory.
- Whoa! Wait a minute, now. Hold it.

265
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:49,101
When? Now you don't really think
you're gonna whip me, do ya?

266
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:53,099
- Well, he didn't come here to lose.
- You hold on, little lady.

267
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:56,818
- Lose, and lose royally, he's gonna do.
- How can you be so sure?

268
00:18:56,948 --> 00:19:02,239
I've been with the best. I beat the best.
I retired more men than Social Security!

269
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:06,203
Excuse, please. You are not
very realistic, are you, Mr Creed?

270
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,326
What are <i>you</i> talkin' about?

271
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,327
You can box, yes, but you are far too
old to think you can win over Drago.

272
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:15,798
- Is that a fact?
- Yes! And it could be a painful one!

273
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:19,509
Put that heavy bag with eyeballs
in the ring with me and <i>you'll</i> see pain!

274
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:22,674
- Why do you insult us?
- Now you just hold on here.

275
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:26,473
I'm not the bad guy. I came to talk
about a friendly exhibition bout

276
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:30,601
- till Comrade Bigmouth started up!
- It is <i>you</i> who are the aggressor.

277
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:33,567
I wish to say to the press, in all fairness,

278
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:37,312
Drago should not even fight this man,
because he is a has-been.

279
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:40,733
You get that big chump
in the ring right now...

280
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:48,831
- Stop this before you get hurt.
- I don't wanna hear! Let that chump go!

281
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:55,461
All right, all right. I've said what I feel.

282
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:58,296
- We'll finish this in the ring!
- Wherever you like.

283
00:19:58,428 --> 00:20:03,255
You shut up, and all these puppets you
brought with you! You're history, chump!

284
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:05,633
- How did I do?
- A little loud for me.

285
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:07,927
- But good?
- Oh, yeah. Very good.

286
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:16,026
<i>Welcome to the City of Lights -
<i>Las Vegas -

287
00:20:16,154 --> 00:20:20,198
<i>and to one of the most unusual</i>
<i>events in years... East meets West.</i>

288
00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:24,116
<i>Age versus youth in</i>
<i>a goodwill exhibition match,</i>

289
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:28,029
<i>as the former champion Apollo Creed</i>
<i>takes on a mountain of muscle</i>

290
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,250
<i>from the Soviet Union... Ivan Drago.</i>

291
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,287
- Come on.
- Patience is a virtue.

292
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:38,297
- I'm ready to rock 'n' roll.
- You gotta get your equipment.

293
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:41,131
- Now you look like a mummy.
- I feel like a mummy.

294
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:44,596
- How does it feel? OK?
- Feels great. I feel like I could eat nails.

295
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:48,094
- I never tried them snails.
- What are you talkin' about?

296
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:52,178
Snails. I never had 'em. I see 'em in
the garden, but I never want to eat 'em.

297
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:57,856
I didn't say anythin' about snails.
I said nails. N-N-Nails, Stallion!

298
00:20:57,988 --> 00:21:00,823
You look pretty good, but, you know,

299
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,523
just do me a favour when you go up there.

300
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:08,323
- Try not to wear yourself out, OK?
- Yeah, wear myself out. Sure.

301
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:11,707
Well, it's just that you ain't
been in the ring for five years.

302
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:16,747
- I just want you to... maintain a little bit.
- I'm in the best shape of my life.

303
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:21,211
- I'm stronger, I'm quicker...
- Hey, I'm not sayin' you're not ready,

304
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:23,966
but personally, if it were me,

305
00:21:24,098 --> 00:21:27,467
I wouldn't mind postponin'
a couple of weeks.

306
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:29,558
Postpone?

307
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:34,349
Come on, Apollo. We don't know anythin'
about this guy you're fightin', really.

308
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:40,024
Let's say I postpone. I pull out, somebody
else steps in and whips this chump.

309
00:21:40,156 --> 00:21:44,071
- Then where does that leave me?
- This is just some kind of exhibition fight.

310
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,986
- This thing don't mean nothin'.
- No, man. That's where you're wrong.

311
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:51,408
This is <i>not</i> just an exhibition fight
that doesn't mean anything.

312
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:56,288
This is us against them.
What are you talkin' about? Come on!

313
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:58,462
Stallion...

314
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:04,511
Maybe you don't know what I'm talkin'
about now, but you will when it's over.

315
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:09,808
Believe me, you will when it's over.

316
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,480
Ivan!

317
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:53,102
Good luck. I hope after we can be friends.

318
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,476
- I hope so.
- Of course. They're sportsmen,

319
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,518
not soldiers.

320
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,570
Enjoy the fight.

321
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,507
<i>~ Ow! Get up! ~</i>

322
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,968
<i>~ Knock it out! Dig! ~</i>

323
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:40,979
<i>~ Hit it! ~</i>

324
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:49,488
<i>~ Hit it! ~</i>

325
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,709
<i>~ Superhighways ~</i>

326
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,962
<i>~ Coast to coast ~</i>

327
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:03,629
<i>~ Easy to get anywhere ~</i>

328
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:08,301
<i>~ On the transcontinental overload ~</i>

329
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:11,264
<i>~ Just slide behind the wheel ~</i>

330
00:24:11,435 --> 00:24:15,349
<i>~ How does it feel?</i>
<i>~ When there's no destination ~</i>

331
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,520
<i>~ That's too far ~</i>

332
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:22,111
<i>~ And somewhere on the way</i>
<i>you might find out who you are, wow! ~</i>

333
00:24:22,238 --> 00:24:24,527
<i>~ Livin' in America ~</i>

334
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:28,193
<i>~ Eye to eye ~</i>

335
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:30,404
<i>~ Station to station ~</i>

336
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:32,827
<i>~ Livin' in America ~</i>

337
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:37,917
<i>~ Hand to hand, across the nation ~</i>

338
00:24:39,088 --> 00:24:41,544
<i>~ Livin' in America ~</i>

339
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:45,257
<i>~ Got to have a celebration ~</i>

340
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:51,429
<i>~ You may not be lookin'</i>
<i>for the Promised Land ~</i>

341
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,181
<i>~ But you might find it anyway ~</i>

342
00:24:56,189 --> 00:24:59,474
<i>~ Under one of those old familiar names ~</i>

343
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:01,934
<i>~ Like New Orleans</i>
<i>New Orleans! ~</i>

344
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,276
<i>~ Detroit City</i>
<i>Detroit City! ~</i>

345
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:06,398
<i>~ Dallas</i>
<i>Dallas! ~</i>

346
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:08,572
<i>~ Pittsburgh PA</i>
<i>Pittsburgh PA! ~</i>

347
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:10,611
<i>~ New York City</i>
<i>New York City! ~</i>

348
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:12,488
<i>~ Kansas City</i>
<i>Kansas City! ~</i>

349
00:25:12,622 --> 00:25:14,282
<i>~ Atlanta, yeah!</i>
<i>Atlanta! ~</i>

350
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:16,658
<i>~ Chicago and LA ~</i>

351
00:25:16,794 --> 00:25:20,542
<i>~ I live in America ~</i>

352
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:23,207
<i>~ Head to head ~</i>

353
00:25:23,342 --> 00:25:25,418
<i>~ Toe to toe ~</i>

354
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:28,838
<i>~ I live in America ~</i>

355
00:25:29,598 --> 00:25:31,258
<i>~ Say it loud ~</i>

356
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,633
<i>~ It’ll make you proud ~</i>

357
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:37,683
<i>~ I live in America ~</i>

358
00:25:37,815 --> 00:25:41,943
<i>~ Hey, I know what it means ~</i>

359
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:44,312
<i>~ Livin' in America ~</i>

360
00:25:44,446 --> 00:25:48,230
<i>~ Got it made! I said now,</i>
<i>eye to eye, tooth to tooth ~</i>

361
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:50,525
<i>~ This is undisputed truth ~</i>

362
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:53,615
<i>~ Livin' in America</i>
<i>Yeah! ~</i>

363
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:58,832
<i>~ All the way with your bad self ~</i>

364
00:25:58,961 --> 00:26:02,294
<i>~ Livin' in America</i>
<i>Yeah! ~</i>

365
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:05,337
<i>~ I feel good! ~</i>

366
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,569
Good evening. Along with
Warner Wolf, I am Stu Nahan.

367
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:27,899
We welcome you to an unusual
event: For the first time ever,

368
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:30,606
West against East in professional sports.

369
00:26:30,744 --> 00:26:33,151
Thanks for gettin' me here. I owe you one.

370
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:36,289
- Oh, no, no. We're even.
- God, I feel born again.

371
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,750
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!

372
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:44,291
I would like to announce the presence
of a true fighting champion

373
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:46,666
that defines the word "courage".

374
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:50,384
The Italian Stallion: Rocky Balboa!

375
00:26:53,183 --> 00:26:55,721
- Excuse me, would you?
- Certainly.

376
00:26:58,438 --> 00:27:00,478
Rocky!

377
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:08,526
Tonight's special event
features two great athletes.

378
00:27:08,658 --> 00:27:12,358
In the blue corner, weighing 221 pounds,

379
00:27:12,495 --> 00:27:15,864
a former heavyweight
champion of the world,

380
00:27:15,998 --> 00:27:18,536
the Dancing Destroyer,

381
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:20,826
the King of Sting,

382
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:23,535
the Count of Monte Fisto...

383
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:26,958
- Think you got enough names?
- Be patient. Almost done.

384
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:33,012
The Master of Disaster,
the one and only Apollo Creed!

385
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:41,722
The crowd anticipating a great fight now
as Apollo plays to the crowd.

386
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:50,074
In the red corner,
weighing an even 261 pounds,

387
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:54,528
gold medallist and undefeated
world amateur champion

388
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:57,284
from the Soviet Union,

389
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:59,455
the Siberian Bull,

390
00:28:00,502 --> 00:28:02,827
Ivan Drago!

391
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:10,921
I want you! I want <i>you!</i> I want <i>you!</i>

392
00:28:11,054 --> 00:28:15,847
The two fighters come to the centre
for instructions from referee Lou Filippo.

393
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:20,519
You know the rules. Watch the low blows,
kidney punches and rabbit punches.

394
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:25,226
In case of a knockdown, go to the corner
and stay there until I tell you to come out.

395
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,939
- Shake hands. Let's have a good fight.
- It's time to go to school, son.

396
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:35,316
Get your hands up! Do you need an
interpreter? It's time to go to school!

397
00:28:35,454 --> 00:28:37,909
You will lose.

398
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:41,971
All right!

399
00:28:42,075 --> 00:28:45,376
The bad blood between these two
can be felt all over this arena.

400
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:48,506
I can't get over the size of this Russian!

401
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:53,053
- Apollo! Apollo!
- Get ready, cos it's showtime! Showtime!

402
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:58,519
- It's showtime!
- Excuse me. Didn't you forget somethin'?

403
00:28:58,645 --> 00:29:00,851
Apollo seems to be in great spirits.

404
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,060
He's really putting on a show
for this capacity crowd.

405
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:06,604
Be back in a minute, all right?

406
00:29:08,863 --> 00:29:10,939
Round one.

407
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,776
Creed's dancing around.

408
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,575
Creed back-pedalling now.
He's been away five years.

409
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:32,838
Neither fighter ready to throw a punch.
A left jab there... and once again.

410
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:39,185
- A slip by Creed.
- This is bizarre.

411
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,889
Creed is over the hill, and...
the Russian hasn't fought anybody.

412
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:55,909
- Keep movin'. Stick him!
- Drago's moving in again.

413
00:29:56,036 --> 00:30:00,532
A left hand by Creed. Another left hand
by Creed, and Drago moves away.

414
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:12,584
Another left hand by Creed. Drago
waiting, waiting, cocking that right hand.

415
00:30:15,723 --> 00:30:18,130
A punishing right by the Russian.

416
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:21,137
Get outta there! Get outta there!

417
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:25,481
A left. He's taking some punishment now.
Drago moves him against the ropes.

418
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:26,806
Tie him up now!

419
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:30,726
The Russian ties him up
and throws Creed across the ring!

420
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:32,939
Move!

421
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:36,365
It is Drago with the upper hand now.

422
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:38,403
Get outta that corner!

423
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:41,112
Another right! Another right!

424
00:30:45,128 --> 00:30:49,375
Creed is against the ropes!
I think they may stop it.

425
00:30:49,507 --> 00:30:55,343
What are you guys doin'?!
This is supposed to be an exhibition!

426
00:30:55,472 --> 00:31:01,676
Tremendous end to the first round by the
Russian, and a very bloody Apollo Creed.

427
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,388
The Soviet's strength is incredible!

428
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:09,901
Champ, look. I gotta stop ya.
This fight's finished. I gotta call it.

429
00:31:10,028 --> 00:31:12,899
- You can't do no more.
- I'm here to fight him.

430
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:17,942
- He's killin' ya! I gotta stop this thing.
- Promise me you're not gonna stop it.

431
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:21,612
That was a pulverising round
for the ex-champion.

432
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:25,793
Hey, folks. Ivan Drago is definitely for real.

433
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:30,248
You don't stop this fight, no matter what.

434
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:32,422
Apollo! Apollo!

435
00:31:35,513 --> 00:31:37,552
No matter what.

436
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:48,602
Creed now comes out
for round two dancing around.

437
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:51,652
The legs appear to be still a little rubbery.

438
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,270
Get your hands up.

439
00:31:55,157 --> 00:31:59,950
And now it is the Russian just standing
there, trying to intimidate Creed.

440
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:06,037
And the Russian throws a right hand
to the jaw! Another right to the head!

441
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:13,967
Creed's being pounded without mercy!

442
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:16,299
Stop the fight!

443
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:21,221
- The referee is thrown across the ring!
- Throw the towel! Throw the towel!

444
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:28,682
- I've never seen Apollo take so much.
- Throw the damn towel!

445
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:37,069
No!

446
00:32:47,294 --> 00:32:50,081
- My God!
- Creed is down!

447
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:55,043
Apollo is down,
and he could be badly hurt.

448
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:59,964
- Get these guys outta here.
- The winner, Ivan Drago.

449
00:33:00,098 --> 00:33:03,930
- Let me through! Apollo!
- I cannot be defeated.

450
00:33:04,061 --> 00:33:06,468
- Is he OK?
- Somebody get a doctor in here!

451
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:11,018
- There is no movement by Creed.
- I defeat old man.

452
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:13,060
- Is he dead?
- Get outta here!

453
00:33:13,195 --> 00:33:15,271
It's absolute pandemonium!

454
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:18,731
Will ya let him breathe?

455
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:22,118
Soon... I defeat real champion.

456
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:25,829
Where's the stretcher?
Let him breathe, for God's sake!

457
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:29,493
What started out as a joke
has turned out to be a disaster.

458
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:31,871
Creed is in a very serious condition.

459
00:33:32,006 --> 00:33:34,332
- Is the man alive?
- You can make it, Apollo.

460
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:36,756
If he dies... he dies.

461
00:33:56,781 --> 00:34:00,232
There's a lot I could say... about this man.

462
00:34:02,412 --> 00:34:05,033
But I don't know if it matters now.

463
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:08,364
I guess what matters is...

464
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:10,957
what he stood for,

465
00:34:12,046 --> 00:34:14,503
what he lived for, and...

466
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:18,292
what he died for.

467
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:22,678
You always did everything...

468
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:26,807
the way <i>you</i> wanted it.

469
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:32,858
I know I didn't understand that, but...

470
00:34:38,824 --> 00:34:41,908
now I understand.

471
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,495
I'll never forget you, Apollo.

472
00:35:06,602 --> 00:35:08,477
You're the best.

473
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:22,985
- Rocky, is the decision final?
- Yes.

474
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,738
Is this the first time
the champion has given up his crown?

475
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:30,372
- I don't know about that.
- Doesn't the title matter?

476
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:32,744
Not until this is over.

477
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:37,173
Considering Rocky's punching power,
do you still expect an easy fight?

478
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,550
- Yes, of course.
- It's a matter of size...

479
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:48,055
and evolution. Isn't it, gentlemen? Drago
is the most perfectly trained athlete ever.

480
00:35:48,186 --> 00:35:53,228
This other man has not the size,
or the endurance, or the genetics to win.

481
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,023
It's physically impossible
for this little man to win.

482
00:35:57,153 --> 00:36:00,404
Drago is a look at the future.

483
00:36:00,532 --> 00:36:04,862
Champ, how much
are you making for this fight?

484
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:09,076
- No money. It's not about money.
- Has the fight date been set yet?

485
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,877
- December 25th.
- Why Christmas?

486
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,410
- That's what I was told.
- Where?

487
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,670
- It's in Russia.
- Are you nuts?

488
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,255
Rocky, what's going on?

489
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,836
We fight in Soviet Union,
or we fight nowhere.

490
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:27,309
Why don't you ask Drago's wife
why she is afraid? Tell them, please.

491
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:32,642
I'm afraid for my husband's life.
We have threats of violence everywhere.

492
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:39,652
We are not in politics. All I want is for my
husband to be safe, to be treated fairly.

493
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,241
You call him a killer.
He's a professional fighter, not a killer.

494
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,784
You have this belief that
you are better than us,

495
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:51,911
that this country is so very good,
and we are so very bad.

496
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,035
You have this belief that you are so fair,
and we are so very cruel.

497
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,249
It is lies and false propaganda

498
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:02,595
to support this antagonistic
and violent government!

499
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:07,847
Violent? We don't keep our people
behind a wall with machine guns!

500
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,265
- Who are you?
- Who am <i>I?</i>

501
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:14,891
- I'm... the unsilent majority, bigmouth!
- Good! Yes, good!

502
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:20,268
Insult us! Is more typical rude behaviour
towards visiting foreigners!

503
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:24,901
But perhaps this simple defeat
of this little so-called champion

504
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,027
will be a perfect example
of how pathetically weak

505
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,248
your society has become. We go!

506
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:44,053
Mrs Balboa!

507
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:47,548
- How do you feel about Russia?
- Is your husband going to Moscow?

508
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:52,642
How does it feel to be part of
such a controversial decision?

509
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:55,393
Did Creed's death
make up your husband's mind?

510
00:37:55,525 --> 00:38:00,400
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Why is he going at Christmas?

511
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:03,731
When will you be going to Russia?

512
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:07,947
I'm not going to Russia. I don't know
what you're talking about!

513
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,115
I don't know what you
people are doing here!

514
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,273
- Rocky?
- Yeah?

515
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,821
- You all right?
- Yeah.

516
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:48,779
Fine.

517
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,952
Why'd you do it?

518
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:58,461
- I just gotta do what I gotta do.
- You don't have to do anything.

519
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:07,088
No, Adrian, I do, and...
I gotta leave this place, too.

520
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,678
So where are you... going?

521
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:13,343
They said they were gonna
let me train in Russia.

522
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:18,721
I just wanna go someplace where I ain't
gonna think about nothin' except him.

523
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,809
Rocky, give it some time. Don't do this.

524
00:39:22,947 --> 00:39:25,105
A lot of people live with hurt.

525
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,076
A lot of people don't have a choice. I do.

526
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:31,487
And for that you're willing
to lose everything?

527
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:34,077
Adrian, this ain't everything.

528
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:40,127
This house, and the cars, and all
the stuff we got... that ain't everything.

529
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:45,380
There's a lot more than this, Adrian.

530
00:39:45,512 --> 00:39:49,556
Before, there were reasons to fight I
understood, but I don't understand this.

531
00:39:49,683 --> 00:39:53,383
Even if you win, what have you won?
Apollo's still gone.

532
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:57,140
Why can't you change your thinking?
Everybody else does!

533
00:39:57,274 --> 00:40:01,105
Cos I'm a fighter!
That's the way I'm made, Adrian.

534
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,188
That's what you married.
We can't change what we are.

535
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:09,409
- Yes, you can.
- You can't change anythin'.

536
00:40:09,536 --> 00:40:13,616
- All we can do is go with what we are.
- You can't go with what you are!

537
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:17,200
Have you read the papers?
Do you know what everybody says?

538
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:21,665
It's suicide! You've seen him.
You know how strong he is.

539
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:24,338
You can't win!

540
00:40:28,013 --> 00:40:30,052
Oh, Adrian.

541
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,516
Adrian always tells the truth.

542
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:38,353
No, maybe I can't win.

543
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:42,982
Maybe the only thing I can do...

544
00:40:43,946 --> 00:40:47,031
is just take everythin' he's got.

545
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:50,942
But to beat me...
he's gonna have to kill me.

546
00:40:52,204 --> 00:40:57,709
And to kill me, he's gonna have to
have the heart to stand in front of me.

547
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:03,915
And to do that, he's gotta
be willin' to die himself.

548
00:41:05,468 --> 00:41:08,504
And I don't know if he's ready to do that.

549
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:10,677
I don't know.

550
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:05,271
<i>~ We're not indestructible ~</i>

00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:09,280

00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:12,678

<i>Be careful with those plaid ones.</i>
<i>They belong to the boss.</i>

598
00:45:53,302 --> 00:45:57,930
<i>Paulie, did you pack your toothbrush?</i>
<i>You know how tobacco stains your teeth.</i>

599
00:45:58,058 --> 00:46:01,509
<i>- If I've told you once, I've told you...</i>
- Hey! Hey!

600
00:46:01,645 --> 00:46:05,263
- Stop bustin' my chops.
<i>- Paulie!</i>

601
00:46:05,399 --> 00:46:09,313
I'm gonna have her wires
tied when I get back.

602
00:46:10,362 --> 00:46:12,935
When will you be back?

603
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:15,529
- Oh, pretty soon.
- Are you scared?

604
00:46:16,994 --> 00:46:20,327
- Nah.
- Yes, you are. A little, maybe?

605
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:23,371
Well, wouldn't you be?

606
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,961
If a big giant man wanted to
beat <i>me</i> up, I'd be real scared.

607
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:34,926
Well, the truth is, you know, sometimes...

608
00:46:36,263 --> 00:46:39,180
I do get a little scared, you know.

609
00:46:39,308 --> 00:46:42,723
When I'm in that ring
and I'm really gettin' hit on,

610
00:46:42,853 --> 00:46:46,767
and my arms hurt so much I can't
even lift them, and I'm thinkin',

611
00:46:46,898 --> 00:46:52,819
"God! I wish this guy would hit me on
the chin so I don't feel nothin' any more."

612
00:46:54,198 --> 00:46:58,777
Then there's another side that
comes out that isn't so scared.

613
00:46:59,078 --> 00:47:01,534
There's another side that, like,

614
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:07,287
wants to take more, that wants
to go that one more round,

615
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:12,580
because by goin' that one more round
when you don't think you can,

616
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:19,222
that's what makes all the difference
in your life. You know what I mean?

617
00:47:20,224 --> 00:47:23,012
And will you remember one more thing?

618
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,762
Will you remember that... Daddy thinks
you're the best boy in the world, hm?

619
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,984
And that Daddy loves you...
no matter what?

620
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:34,151
Will you?

621
00:47:41,704 --> 00:47:44,161
I gotta go now.

622
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:47,209
- You gonna take care of everythin'?
- OK.

623
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:51,002
And don't forget to feed your robot.

624
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:54,339
Bye, baby.

625
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,175
Good luck.

626
00:47:57,805 --> 00:47:59,963
Thanks.

627
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:02,934
Come on! The meter's runnin'!

628
00:48:29,878 --> 00:48:32,832
<i>~ Two worlds collide, rival nations ~</i>

629
00:48:34,174 --> 00:48:39,550
<i>~ It's a primitive clash,</i>
<i>venting years of frustration ~</i>

630
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:43,216

631

00:48:51,568 --> 00:48:53,940
<i>~ Does the crowd understand? ~</i>

634
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,312
<i>~ Is it East versus West ~</i>

635
00:48:56,448 --> 00:48:58,773
<i>~ Or man against man? ~</i>

636
00:48:58,908 --> 00:49:03,321

637
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:06,661

<i>~ In the darkest night... ~</i>

641
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:18,340
What a horrendous flight.

642
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:21,720
This is Russia?
It don't look so tough, Rock.

643
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,742
Mr Balboa.

644
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,291
We take you to quarters now.

645
00:49:54,423 --> 00:49:58,717
Hey, when does the sun come up?
This is detrimental to my sinuses.

646
00:49:59,387 --> 00:50:02,672
Weather changes, hour to hour.
Get used to it.

647
00:50:04,183 --> 00:50:07,967
Get in car now. We have very long trip.

648
00:50:08,104 --> 00:50:10,559
He sounds like Dracula's cousin.

649
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:17,149
<i>~ In the warrior's code</i>
<i>there's no surrender ~</i>

650
00:50:18,197 --> 00:50:23,488
<i>~ Though his body says "Stop",</i>
<i>his spirit cries "Never!" ~</i>

651
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:27,120
<i>~ Deep in our soul a quiet ember ~</i>

652
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:29,831
<i>~ Knows it's you against you ~</i>

653
00:50:30,335 --> 00:50:34,203
<i>~ It's the paradox that drives us on ~</i>

654
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,707
<i>~ It's a battle of wills ~</i>

655
00:50:37,843 --> 00:50:42,670
<i>~ In the heat of attack,</i>
<i>it's the passion that kills ~</i>

656
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:47,302
<i>~ That victory is yours alone ~</i>

657
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,677
<i>~ In the burning heart ~</i>

658
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,020
<i>~ Just about to burst ~</i>

659
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:57,859
<i>~ There's a quest for answers,</i>
<i>an unquenchable thirst ~</i>

660
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:02,733
<i>~ In the darkest night, rising like a spire ~</i>

661
00:51:02,868 --> 00:51:07,743
<i>~ In the burning heart,</i>
<i>the unmistakable fire ~</i>

662
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:13,200
Like you requested, yes?

663
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:16,124
- You requested this dumb location?
- Yeah.

664
00:51:16,715 --> 00:51:20,049
Why? You plannin' to grow
reindeer or somethin'?

665
00:51:21,763 --> 00:51:27,433
- I just wanted to get away from things.
- The equipment you requested is in barn.

666
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,434
- Who are they?
- They?

667
00:51:33,566 --> 00:51:36,353
They are assigned to you.

668
00:51:36,486 --> 00:51:39,155
Official chaperons, yes?

669
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,569
Where you go, they go.

670
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,859
Oh, I have a bad dream here.

671
00:51:45,787 --> 00:51:50,199
- Paul, it's OK.
- OK? This is below human standards.

672
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:54,746
There's no antennas. You gotta
complain. We'll crack out here!

673
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:58,213
You have everything
I have been instructed to provide.

674
00:51:58,341 --> 00:52:02,588
We are finished, yes? <i>Da svidaniya.</i>

675
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:14,604
No sparrin'?

676
00:52:17,403 --> 00:52:20,522
I don't think I need it any more, Paulie.

677
00:52:20,656 --> 00:52:23,064
No sparrin', no TV, nothin'?

678
00:52:23,492 --> 00:52:26,612
How the heck is he supposed
to train around here?

679
00:52:27,204 --> 00:52:29,991
No TV. What about the Rose Bowl game?

680
00:52:30,332 --> 00:52:34,460
No room service, I bet.
I hope they got my comics here.

681
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:37,078
What a depressing vacation.

682
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:46,553
Goddamn!

683
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:54,978
<i>All right, you Chipmunks.</i>
<i>Ready to sing your song?</i>

684
00:52:55,107 --> 00:52:59,057
<i>~ Christmas, Christmastime is here ~</i>

685
00:52:59,612 --> 00:53:04,108
<i>~ Time for toys and time for cheer ~</i>

686
00:53:04,241 --> 00:53:08,619
<i>~ We've been good, but we can't last... ~</i>

687
00:53:08,747 --> 00:53:11,416
Checkmate, friend.

688
00:53:25,013 --> 00:53:28,014
- Yeah?
- Hey, champ. Can I come up?

689
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:30,181
Yeah, sure.

690
00:53:32,646 --> 00:53:34,804
- How you doin'?
- Pretty good.

691
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:39,186
- Some kinda weather we're havin', huh?
- Yeah, it's pretty rough.

692
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:41,988
But for what you gotta do, it's good.

693
00:53:43,615 --> 00:53:46,485
- Toughen you up.
- I guess so.

694
00:53:46,618 --> 00:53:51,196
I know you're gonna have to do almost
everything alone, but I'll be with you.

695
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:53,370
Yeah, I know.

696
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,501
Apollo was like my son.

697
00:53:56,628 --> 00:53:59,166
I raised him.

698
00:53:59,297 --> 00:54:01,872
And when he died... a part of me died.

699
00:54:04,053 --> 00:54:06,805
But now... <i>you're</i> the one.

700
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:11,260
You're the one that's gonna keep
his spirit alive. You're the one...

701
00:54:11,394 --> 00:54:15,522
that's gonna make sure
that he didn't die for nothing.

702
00:54:15,648 --> 00:54:18,649
Now you're gonna have
to go through hell,

703
00:54:18,776 --> 00:54:21,943
worse than any nightmare
that you ever dreamed.

704
00:54:22,238 --> 00:54:27,196
But in the end...
I know you'll be the one standin'.

705
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:31,034
I'll try.

706
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:36,123
I'll try.

707
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:42,254
You know what you gotta do.

708
00:54:44,343 --> 00:54:46,799
Do it.

709
00:54:47,221 --> 00:54:49,261
Do it!

710
00:54:54,604 --> 00:54:56,644
Thanks, Duke.

711
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:12,736
I couldn't stay away any more.

712
00:59:16,245 --> 00:59:18,701
I missed you.

713
00:59:20,916 --> 00:59:23,586
I missed <i>you.</i>

714
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:27,166
I'm with you, no matter what.

715
00:59:27,466 --> 00:59:29,505
No matter what?

716
00:59:32,137 --> 00:59:34,379
No matter what.

717
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:24,313
<i>~ Silent darkness creeps into your soul ~</i>

718
01:00:26,859 --> 01:00:31,403

01:00:33,866 --> 01:00:38,528
<i>~ The cage that holds</i>

720
01:00:41,207 --> 01:00:44,327

01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,130

01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:20,618
<i>~ Oh! ~</i>

729
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:27,462
No pain. No pain.

01:01:58,577 --> 01:02:01,744
<i>~ Heart's on fire ~</i>

01:02:01,872 --> 01:02:05,740

739

Drago!

740
01:04:00,327 --> 01:04:03,660
Drago!

741
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:11,126
Drago!

742
01:04:13,048 --> 01:04:15,965
Hello, and merry Christmas
from a very unusual place.

743
01:04:16,093 --> 01:04:20,304
We're in Moscow. I'm Barry Tompkins,
along with Al Bandiero,

744
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:24,380
and this promises to be the most
watched event in boxing history.

745
01:04:24,518 --> 01:04:29,678
The Iron Horse from America, Rocky
Balboa, comes here to the Soviet Union...

746
01:04:31,149 --> 01:04:36,061
Ivan Drago: Since that tragedy in Las
Vegas and the death of Apollo Creed,

747
01:04:36,196 --> 01:04:39,316
he's been re-nicknamed
"Death from Above".

748
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:53,131
Drago! Drago!

749
01:05:11,232 --> 01:05:15,479
The general secretary of the Soviet
and other members of the Politburo

750
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:20,570
have now made their way to their seats
high above the ring here in Moscow.

751
01:05:25,872 --> 01:05:30,581
I know you're kinda busy, but I wanna
tell you some things I never told you.

752
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:35,787
I know sometimes I act stupid and I say
stupid things, but you kept me around

753
01:05:35,923 --> 01:05:40,052
when other people would've said
"Drop that bum." You give me respect.

754
01:05:40,178 --> 01:05:44,046
It's hard for me to say these kinda
things because that ain't my way,

755
01:05:44,183 --> 01:05:49,557
but if I could unzip myself and step out
and be someone else, I'd wanna be you.

756
01:05:49,688 --> 01:05:51,728
You're all heart, Rock.

757
01:05:54,276 --> 01:05:56,483
Thanks, Paulie.

758
01:05:56,612 --> 01:05:58,770
Now blast this guy's teeth out!

759
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:02,564
I'll try.

760
01:06:17,466 --> 01:06:22,093
One of the fighters is starting to make his
way through this crowd toward the ring.

761
01:06:22,221 --> 01:06:26,550
- Listen to this crowd!
- This borders on pure hatred.

762
01:06:26,684 --> 01:06:31,559
Rocky's face: Absolutely like stone,
a picture of concentration,

763
01:06:31,689 --> 01:06:34,855
and the booing crowd here does
not seem to bother him one bit.

764
01:06:34,984 --> 01:06:37,654
The champ has a look that
could burn through lead.

765
01:06:37,779 --> 01:06:41,563
It seems the booing crowd has
absolutely no effect on the man.

766
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,776
His concentration is like stone.

767
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:46,282
- That's my dad.
- We know.

768
01:06:46,413 --> 01:06:48,785
What do you think we are - nerds?

769
01:06:48,915 --> 01:06:51,869
Listen to this crowd. It sounds insane.

770
01:06:59,467 --> 01:07:03,382
And now the entrance
of the Russian national champion.

771
01:07:03,513 --> 01:07:08,009
Ivan Drago, a man with
an entire country in his corner.

772
01:08:00,655 --> 01:08:03,655
Look at the expression
on the face of Ivan Drago.

773
01:08:03,783 --> 01:08:06,949
He seems impervious
to this madness of the crowd.

774
01:08:07,078 --> 01:08:09,948
He's like a volcano just waiting to erupt.

775
01:08:10,081 --> 01:08:14,790
The Russian is cool
as he acknowledges his premier.

776
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:20,584
I would like to point out again,
this is a non-sanctioned fight.

777
01:08:20,716 --> 01:08:26,222
This is not for the title. The American
Boxing Commission has not sanctioned it.

778
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:03,525
Ladies and gentlemen...

779
01:10:11,496 --> 01:10:13,205
Rocky Balboa!

780
01:10:17,753 --> 01:10:22,913
It's unbelievable.
I have never seen such a hostile crowd.

781
01:10:31,642 --> 01:10:33,516
Ivan Drago!

782
01:10:43,988 --> 01:10:49,326
Roaring for their champion!
The two men are walking to the centre.

783
01:10:49,451 --> 01:10:52,488
It's an unbelievable sight to see.

784
01:10:52,621 --> 01:10:54,661
They're toe to toe.

785
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:59,785
The Russian towers above the American.
It's a true case of David and Goliath here.

786
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,788
It's unbelievable, the...
the condition of both men.

787
01:11:05,009 --> 01:11:07,335
I must break you.

788
01:11:13,685 --> 01:11:17,184
Remember what I said
about wanting to be you?

789
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:19,353
Forget it.

790
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:22,356
Thanks, Paul.

791
01:11:30,535 --> 01:11:34,200
Take it straight to him, and be
a rock for me, you understand?

792
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:38,163
Be a rock for me! Be strong!
All right? Take it to him! No pain.

793
01:11:38,293 --> 01:11:41,744
- No pain. No pain.
- No pain. No pain. All right, Rock. Do it!

794
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,835
There's the bell.
Rocky comes to the centre of the ring,

795
01:11:47,969 --> 01:11:51,919
like the Russian, way back
into Balboa's corner now.

796
01:11:56,436 --> 01:11:59,770
- Get outta there!
- Let's go, Rocky!

797
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:08,194
Balboa gets out of the corner, and it is
Drago backing Rocky up with a jab.

798
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:13,828
And Balboa is not staying on balance
because of the long jab of the Russian.

799
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:16,243
Brace yourself! Brace yourself!

800
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,792
Hands up!

801
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:26,459
- Charge him!
- Now!

802
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:29,510
He can't seem to touch the Russian.

803
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:34,465
Rocky pounding away, and he's just hit
him with everything he's got.

804
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,222
And Drago just smiled at him.

805
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,313
- Keep choppin' away!
- Chop him down! Chop him down!

806
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,825
Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble!

807
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:54,071
They might have to stop this one
before somebody gets killed.

808
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:57,371
Reach and grab him! Reach and grab him!

809
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:03,452
Rocky woke the sleeping giant,
and now he's paying the price!

810
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:07,882
A right hand from Drago sends Rocky
Balboa 15 feet across the ring,

811
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:10,465
and the champ is down!

812
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:18,348
Come on! Get up!

813
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:22,854
Hands up! Hands up!

814
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:34,910
Drago continuing to punish Rocky.
He will not let him out of that corner,

815
01:13:35,037 --> 01:13:39,615
and Rocky Balboa is just trying to
get through this first round.

816
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:48,792
The Russian just threw Rocky Balboa
into his own corner like a rag doll.

817
01:13:48,926 --> 01:13:51,464
What a tough three minutes
for Rocky Balboa.

818
01:13:51,596 --> 01:13:54,632
He's not only fighting
an invincible opponent,

819
01:13:54,766 --> 01:13:57,221
he's also fighting a hostile crowd,

820
01:13:57,352 --> 01:14:01,729
and the Russian premier and
most of the Politburo looking on.

821
01:14:01,856 --> 01:14:05,307
- What's happenin' out there?
- He's winnin'.

822
01:14:06,527 --> 01:14:09,528
- I see three of him out there.
- Hit the one in the middle.

823
01:14:09,656 --> 01:14:12,740
- Right! Hit the one in the middle!
- Yeah.

824
01:14:12,867 --> 01:14:15,275
You're not doing as you're told.

825
01:14:15,745 --> 01:14:18,532
The American is small and weak...

826
01:14:18,873 --> 01:14:20,248
Weak.

827
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:25,500
Take his heart. If you hurt him, you'll
take his heart. No pain! Keep workin'!

828
01:14:28,007 --> 01:14:30,759
Round two.
It's been a one-sided fight so far.

829
01:14:30,885 --> 01:14:34,753
It'll take more than luck
for Rocky to survive this round.

830
01:14:35,014 --> 01:14:37,221
Slip him a hook, Rock! Slip him a hook!

831
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:42,428
Balboa trying to stay in the middle
of the ring against the big Russian.

832
01:14:44,984 --> 01:14:47,688
Do what you gotta do! Stay with him!

833
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,735
For all intent,
Balboa should be all finished,

834
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:59,575
but he's fighting back ferociously.

835
01:15:03,752 --> 01:15:05,792
Rocky!

836
01:15:06,839 --> 01:15:12,046
Balboa goes down again from
a right hand! Bounces right back up.

837
01:15:13,012 --> 01:15:15,253
He's gettin' killed out there!

838
01:15:18,559 --> 01:15:22,259
Rocky Balboa has taken
Ivan Drago's best punches so far.

839
01:15:22,396 --> 01:15:27,188
He's cut and he's bleeding,
but he's on his feet and he's on the run!

840
01:15:33,157 --> 01:15:35,945
- He's cut! He's cut!
- The Russian's cut!

841
01:15:36,077 --> 01:15:41,238
And it's a bad cut! And now it's
Rocky Balboa coming after Ivan Drago!

842
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:52,884
Incredible! Get him!

843
01:15:57,807 --> 01:16:01,223
Drago wants to go on!
He grabs Balboa by the throat!

844
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:05,646
Balboa picking up the Russian and throws
him to the ground like a wrestler.

845
01:16:05,774 --> 01:16:09,771
It's a gutter war!
No holds barred in Moscow!

846
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:13,402
Rocky may be on the receiving end
so far, but he's here to fight.

847
01:16:13,531 --> 01:16:16,568
This is shaping up to be
a personal war, and right now

848
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:19,453
it's anybody's boxing match.

849
01:16:20,872 --> 01:16:24,822
You're doin' good, Rocko.
I couldn't do better myself.

850
01:16:25,168 --> 01:16:26,366
How can you do this?

851
01:16:26,503 --> 01:16:28,412
He's nothing... soft!

852
01:16:28,546 --> 01:16:31,383
You got him hurt bad. Now he's worried.

853
01:16:31,509 --> 01:16:34,379
You cut him! You hurt him! You see?

854
01:16:34,512 --> 01:16:37,003
You see? He's not a machine. He's a man!

855
01:16:37,264 --> 01:16:39,222
He's not human...

856
01:16:40,893 --> 01:16:43,728
He's like a piece of iron.

857
01:16:44,689 --> 01:16:48,307
- You want it more than he does! No pain!
- No pain.

858
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,396
- No pain.
- No pain. OK! Take it to him!

859
01:16:51,529 --> 01:16:53,237
Take it to him! Take it to him!

860
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:12,918
Get up!

861
01:17:54,301 --> 01:17:57,634
And a big right hand by Rocky Balboa!

862
01:18:24,207 --> 01:18:27,077
You're doin' fine. You're doin' great.

863
01:19:31,942 --> 01:19:34,065
Come on!

864
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:43,579
A few cheers now for Rocky Balboa!

865
01:19:43,704 --> 01:19:46,621
Suddenly Moscow is pro-Rocky!

866
01:19:58,761 --> 01:20:00,967
No pain. No pain.

867
01:20:25,872 --> 01:20:28,078
Al, this place is ready to explode.

868
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:32,122
Lethal punch after punch.
Amazing willpower!

869
01:20:32,253 --> 01:20:37,793
And Rocky's determination is beginning
to win over what was a hostile crowd.

870
01:20:37,926 --> 01:20:39,206
This is incredible.

871
01:20:40,178 --> 01:20:43,013
- What round is it?
- 15. One more round.

872
01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:46,140
There's no stoppin' us now.
This is our round.

873
01:20:46,267 --> 01:20:48,937
Rocky! Rocky!

874
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:53,930
No stoppin' now!
You start and you don't stop!

875
01:20:54,067 --> 01:20:58,314
All your strength! All your power!
All your love! Everythin' you've got!

876
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:02,825
You trained this fool. He's a disgrace.

877
01:21:03,661 --> 01:21:05,903
Listen to them...

878
01:21:06,038 --> 01:21:09,288
Our people cheer for HIM! You idiot.

879
01:21:09,709 --> 01:21:10,751
WIN!

880
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:18,129
<i>Nyet!</i>

881
01:21:19,051 --> 01:21:21,008
I fight to win!

882
01:21:21,846 --> 01:21:23,044
For me!

883
01:21:24,765 --> 01:21:26,473
For me!

884
01:21:28,019 --> 01:21:32,727
To win you gotta knock him out! Punch
and punch till you can't punch no more!

885
01:21:33,107 --> 01:21:37,436
- This is your whole life here!
- Yeah, knock him out, Rocko.

886
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:39,609
Do it now! Now!

887
01:21:39,739 --> 01:21:45,029
- There's the bell. The war is on.
- This is the last round.

888
01:21:48,539 --> 01:21:50,413
To the end.

889
01:21:52,043 --> 01:21:56,456
Which of these magnificent fighters
will be standing at the end?

890
01:21:56,590 --> 01:22:00,588
Drago snaps out a stiff jab. And another.

891
01:22:02,846 --> 01:22:07,971
Rocky taking punishment. Trying to get
inside. He's completely exhausted.

892
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:11,895
Come on, Rock! What are you waitin' for?!

893
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:16,225
Rocky! Rocky!

894
01:22:19,196 --> 01:22:21,235
Hit him!

895
01:22:26,912 --> 01:22:29,319
Come on! Fight!

896
01:22:46,473 --> 01:22:49,261
Balboa is chopping the Russian down!

897
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:54,060
Rocky Balboa throwing
punches at the Russian.

898
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:58,567
And Drago throws a hard right hand
that stuns Rocky Balboa!

899
01:23:02,949 --> 01:23:05,487
Don't go down! Don't go down!

900
01:23:09,664 --> 01:23:15,453
Forget technique, forget strategy.
This is a street fight. Who wants it most?

901
01:23:15,586 --> 01:23:18,587
- What is he doin'?!
- He's winnin'!

902
01:23:22,969 --> 01:23:25,424
To the body! To the body!

903
01:23:31,019 --> 01:23:33,688
Rocko, knock his head off!

904
01:23:43,282 --> 01:23:45,524
You're gonna do it!

905
01:23:55,669 --> 01:23:56,832
Ivan!

906
01:23:59,798 --> 01:24:02,206
Four!

907
01:24:09,266 --> 01:24:15,020
Rocky Balboa has done the impossible!
And these people love him!

908
01:24:15,147 --> 01:24:17,555
It is absolute pandemonium!

909
01:24:17,691 --> 01:24:21,771
More than ever, Rocky has
proven himself a true champion!

910
01:24:23,113 --> 01:24:25,106
Rocky! Rocky!

911
01:24:53,269 --> 01:24:55,309
Thank you.

912
01:25:00,568 --> 01:25:05,029
I came here tonight,
and I didn't know what to expect.

913
01:25:07,742 --> 01:25:11,028
I seen... a lot of people hatin' me,

914
01:25:11,162 --> 01:25:14,199
and... I didn't know

915
01:25:14,332 --> 01:25:19,956
what to feel about that, so... I guess
I didn't like you much none either.

916
01:25:24,968 --> 01:25:30,390
Durin' this... fight...
I seen a lot of changin'.

917
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:37,270
The way... youse felt about me,

918
01:25:37,857 --> 01:25:40,395
and the way I felt... about you.

919
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:47,733
In here, there were two guys...

920
01:25:49,118 --> 01:25:55,536
killin' each other, but I guess...
that's better than 20 million.

921
01:25:59,128 --> 01:26:01,619
What I'm tryin' to say is...

922
01:26:03,924 --> 01:26:05,964
that if I can change...

923
01:26:08,262 --> 01:26:10,302
and <i>you</i> can change,

924
01:26:12,475 --> 01:26:14,551
everybody can change!

925
01:26:31,161 --> 01:26:32,860
Excuse me!

926
01:26:33,664 --> 01:26:38,622
I just wanna say one thing to my kid,
who should be home sleepin'.

927
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,663
Merry Christmas, kid!

928
01:26:42,172 --> 01:26:44,005
I love you!
