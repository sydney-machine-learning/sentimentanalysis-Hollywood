1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,295

00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,186
Timothy Brown in Nashville!

00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,273
Along with the spectacular

with Robert DoQui in Nashville!

00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:11,028

Gwen Welles
and Keenan Wynn in Nashville!

19
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,763
Be the first on your block
to marvel at the magnificent stars...

20
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,098
through the magic of stereophonic sound
and living-color picture...

21
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,351
right before your very eyes
without commercial interruption.

22
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,270
Fellow taxpayers...

23
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,856
and stockholders in America...

24
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,400
on the first Tuesday
in November...

25
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,488
we have to make some vital decisions
about our management.

26
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,032
Let me go directly
to the point.

27
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,868
I'm for doing some replacing.

28
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,078
I've discussed
the Replacement Party...

29
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,289
with people
all over this country...

30
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,542
and I'm often confronted
with the statement...

31
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,462
"I don't want
to get mixed up in politics"...

32
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,924
or "I'm tired of politics,"
or "I'm not interested."

33
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:18,262
Almost as often someone says,
"I can't do anything about it anyway."

34
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,058
Let me point out two things.

35
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,060
Number one:

36
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,896
All of us are
deeply involved with politics...

37
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,023
whether we know it or not...

38
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,651
and whether we like it or not.

39
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,444
And number two:

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,614
We can do something about it.

41
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,325
When you pay more
for an automobile...

42
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,995
than it cost Columbus to make
his first voyage to America...

43
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,289
that's politics.

44
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,113
- That girl down there.
- Hold it! Hold it, everybody.

45
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,906
Honey, you gotta
get her out.

46
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,324
- Bob.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,993
I want to talk to Buddy.

48
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,328
Buddy?

49
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,871
Y-Yes, sir, Dad?

50
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,250
Buddy, who is that woman
in there with the hat on?

51
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,087
- She a friend of yours?
- Mr. Hamilton, I'm Opal.

52
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,798
I'm from the BBC, and I'm doing
a documentary on Nashville.

53
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,884
You know I don't allow no people
visitin' when I'm recording.

54
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,095
I want no recording equipment
in that studio.

55
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,930
- Buddy, escort the lady out.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,976
If she wants a copy of this record,
she can buy it when it's released.

57
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,104
No, darling, I'm sorry.
No strangers at all.

58
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,606
Mr. Hamilton,
I'll be waiting outside for you.

59
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,817
We'll have a little interview.

60
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,486
I want to do another one.
Jimmy, you count off.

61
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,447
I want to hear
a little more Haven in this one.

62
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,745
Ah, there we are.

63
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,955
This is Studio B right here.

64
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,791
- They're doing some gospel.
- Oh, how sweet!

65
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,919
A recording of some sort.
Glenn, how are you?

66
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,255
- Mind if we sit in?
- Come on in.

67
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,590
It's so little!

68
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,593
We'll be going down front
so we'll get out of their way.

69
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,221
It's so pretty! I've been
to all the recording studios in London.

70
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,891
They're always enormous
and very impersonal.

71
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,642
This is so cozy.

72
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,187
- Keep down so they can...
- Yes, of course.

73
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,980
So they can see
what's going on.

74
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,940
There we are.

75
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,988
This is a choir...
a black choir...

76
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,158
from part of...
from Fisk University here in town.

77
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,868
Good Lord!

78
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,162
- The lady singing is...
- Is she a missionary?

79
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,831
No, she's not.
She's a gospel singer.

80
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,751
She's the wife
of our attorney.

81
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,922
I was making
a documentary in Kenya...

82
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,175
and there was this marvelous
woman who was a missionary.

83
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,886
That's why I asked.
She was sensational.

84
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,722
She was converting Kikuyus
by the dozens.

85
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,850
She was trying to convert Masais.
Of course, they were hopeless.

86
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,311
I mean, they have
their own sort of religion.

87
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,128
Look at that.
That rhythm is fantastic.

88
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,882
You know, it's funny.
You can tell...

89
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,177
It's come down in the genes
through ages and ages...

90
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,388
and hundreds of years,
but it's there.

91
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,390
Take off those robes...

92
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,726
and one is in... in...
in darkest Africa.

93
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,397
I can just see
their naked, frenzied bodies...

94
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,899
dancing to the beat of...

95
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,901
Do they carry on
like that in church?

96
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,695
Depends on which church
you go to.

97
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,318
Hold it, everybody.

98
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,278
Damn it, Bob.

99
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,157
What's the name
of the piano player, Bob?

100
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,952
- That's Frog.
- "That's Frog." He plays like a frog.

101
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,496
We'll try it again.

102
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,543
Jimmy, you count off.

103
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,709
- Damn it to hell!
- Hold it, everybody.

104
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,588
- Bob.
- Yes, sir?

105
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,383
What did you say
the piano player's name was?

106
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,802
- Frog.
- Yeah.

107
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,888
When I ask for Pig, I want Pig.

108
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,850
Now, you get me Pig, and then
we'll be ready to record this here tune.

109
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,895
Yes, sir.

110
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,610
You get your hair cut.
You don't belong in Nashville.

111
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,716
This is Bill Jenkins
on special assignment...

112
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,926
for Channel Two News
here at Metro Airport.

113
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,928
We are awaiting
the arrival of Barbara Jean...

114
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,931
who has been away for treatment
at the Baltimore Burn Center.

115
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,184
Already, prior to her arrival,
around 3,000 Barbara Jean fans...

116
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,228
and supporters are here.

117
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,648
They are being held inside
the terminal by security police.

118
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,193
Ma'am, excuse me.
Am I late for Barbara Jean's plane?

119
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,739
- I don't think so, but they're
not gonna let you out there.
- Thank you, ma'am.

120
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:00,492
Members of the Chamber of Commerce
and other fans are on the way.

121
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,246
Also, it's reported Haven Hamilton
will make an appearance here.

122
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,708
There is no question about being involved.

123
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,794
The question is,
what to do?

124
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,921
It is the very nature
of government...

125
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,382
to strain at a gnat
and swallow a camel.

126
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,595
As loyal citizens,
we accept our take-home pay...

127
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,056
understand
most of the deductions...

128
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,517
and even, to a degree,
come to expect them.

129
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,355
However, when a government
begins to force its citizens...

130
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,231
to swallow a camel...

131
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:35,152
it's time to pause
and do some accounting.

132
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,613
Her plane has touched down.
It's down the taxiway...

133
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,240
and will be turning
onto the ramp area...

134
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,951
directly here in front of us
at Metro Airport.

135
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,412
Could you pass me
the crackers, please?

136
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,456
- There you go.
- Thank you.

137
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,756
- Miss, may I have...
- Hi!

138
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,800
A caramel sundae, please?

139
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,718
Honey, we ain't got
no caramel sundae.

140
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,971
- Butterscotch?
- We ain't got no butterscotch sundae.

141
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,018
- Got a strawberry.
- Strawberries are always in season.

142
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,270
Fine, fine.

143
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,023
- That's fine. Thank you.
- Good for you too.

144
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,069
Thank you. Then I'll have
a strawberry sundae, if I may.

145
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,488
- You got it.
- Thank you.

146
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,241
- Sueleen, did you see what he did?
- One strawberry sundae!

147
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,368
Did you see
what he just did?

148
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,371
He took the thing off the salt
and threw it up in the air.

149
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,123
Why'd you do that?

150
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,750
What are you doin'
in Nashville?

151
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,836
- Oh, I live here.
- You do?

152
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,713
Hey, fellas, come here.
I want you to see somethin'.

153
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,216
My wife and I...

154
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,177
- My wife is sick, unfortunately.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

155
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,139
Oh, it's just one of those things
that happens.

156
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,975
- Happens in the best of families.
- Yeah.

157
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,019
I wrote me this real hot song.
You wanna hear it?

158
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,355
It's called
"I Never Get Enough."

159
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,899
Okay, listen. All right?

160
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,635
At any moment, Barbara Jean will be
stepping out and will be greeted...

161
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,639
by the Chamber of Commerce,
as well as Mr. Sperry.

162
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,560
Mr. Sperry making his way
to the aircraft now with a big wave.

163
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,063
Of course, he's the president
of Barnett Enterprises.

164
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,065
- We'll be talking with Mr. Sperry...
- How you doin'?

165
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,739
John Triplette?

166
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,076
- You looking for me? I'm John Triplette.
- Oh!

167
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,120
- How are you?
- Hey, John. How are you?

168
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,415
Those kids
in those uniforms are terrific.

169
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,375
- Hello.
- What's your name?

170
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,254
- Del Reese. I'm sorry. Forgive me.
- Thanks for coming out.

171
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,715
- It's a great idea.
- You mean the girls in the costumes?

172
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,518
Barbara Jean's
still on the aircraft. We'll be awaiting...

173
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,065
Thousands of people
have turned out at Metro Airport...

174
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,609
to greet Barbara Jean
on her arrival.

175
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,946
Haven Hamilton has just arrived,
typically dressed in white...

176
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,699
his white Jeep being driven
today by his son, Bud.

177
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,161
Members of the Chamber of Commerce
are going over to meet Haven Hamilton.

178
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,122
He's greeting some of his old friends,
business acquaintances.

179
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,458
Autograph seekers are now
making their way over.

180
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,877
Barbara Jean still
is aboard the aircraft...

181
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,505
- Hello, Martha.
- Hi.

182
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,174
- How are you, Martha?
- I'm okay, but, uh...

183
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,261
- Pardon me?
- Listen, uh, I've changed my name.

184
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,472
- Okay.
- It's L.A. Joan from now on.

185
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,432
Let me get some cigarettes.

186
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,351
Your Aunt Esther wants to see you.

187
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,271
- She's in the hospital...
- Wait a minute.

188
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,815
- And she'd like to see...
- This guy's a rock star. Hang on.

189
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,320
Can I get your autograph?
You're Tom, aren't you?

190
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,989
Tom, Bill, and Mary?

191
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,533
Jesus, you ought to stop that diet
before you ruin yourself.

192
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,662
Do you believe this? They have
our album here. Hey, how's it selling?

193
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,789
- What's that?
- Bill, Mary, and Tom.

194
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,916
A little slow,
but we sell mostly country.

195
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,795
I'm the handsome one in the front.
I don't have my glasses on
in the picture, but I...

196
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,924
Wait a minute! Hal Phillip Walker
looks exactly like Connie White.

197
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,684
Now, Del, I like...
I like the idea of bands.

198
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,312
I want you to listen
to those little kids, honey.

199
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,397
I want you to know
they practiced...

200
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,524
every day after school
for two hours...

201
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,401
for a whole month
just for this event.

202
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,236
- Yes, that's so nice.
- Isn't that cute?

203
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,530
I think that'll cheer her up.
Pearl, shut up.

204
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:52,618
- Just like your mama, son.
- Yes, yes, I'm sure he is.

205
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,829
... tragically burned
in an accident involving a fire baton.

206
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,707
She has now fully recovered.
However, she's required to take...

207
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,543
- Excuse me, Barnett.
- I got no time right now!

208
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,295
Jesus!

209
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,881
I just think they're so cute,
Buddy.

210
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,383
Hello, hello. Testing.
I wonder if this thing's on.

211
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,386
Hey, wait. Are you Tom
of Bill, Mary, and Tom?

212
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,347
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Jamie.

213
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,891
You thought of voting
for Walker for president?

214
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,311
- I don't vote for nobody.
- Oh, come on.

215
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,563
Just read it.
He's got a fantastic platform.

216
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,608
How you doin', Sarge?
Ya kill anybody this week?

217
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,072
Did you ever see
such pretty girls in your life?

218
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,033
Someday you're gonna be
big girls like your mommies...

219
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,203
and you're gonna be lookin'
for a nice, young, handsome man.

220
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,330
Come on, Buddy.
You say hello.

221
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,583
My son Buddy, he just graduated
from Harvard Law School...

222
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,836
and we're tryin' to give him
all the breaks we never got.

223
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,130
- Buddy, say hello to the people.
- Hi.

224
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,758
Thank you, Buddy.

225
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,595
And thank you again for comin' here
and makin' us all feel so at home.

226
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,812
Here she comes!
Our Barbara Jean!

227
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,608
Come on.
Get on the other side.

228
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,778
Here's our own Barbara Jean!

229
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,488
May I have a word, Barnett?

230
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,282
None of that shit.
Come on. Come on.

231
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,034
Get up there.
Come on.

232
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,328
Who do you think
you are? Marlon Brando?

233
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,747
Barbara Jean, ladies and gentlemen!

234
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,251
- Hi!
- Ah, look at that!

235
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,089
Thank you so much.
Hi, sweetie, darling!

236
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,886
Hi, Bill. Hi, Mary.
Where's Tom?

237
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,805
- Take my bag?
- Sure.

238
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,850
- You were supposed
to meet us at the gate.
- Then let's go meet at the gate.

239
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,436
- Norman, let's go to the limo.
- The limo is just outside.

240
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,981
Barbara Jean, for you.

241
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,358
- Thank you, Haven.
- Right here for the photographer.

242
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,653
Thank you, Tennessee Twirlers,
for coming out today...

243
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,239
and thank you,
Franklin High School Band.

244
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,075
I think you kids
get better every year.

245
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:28,315
Oh, little beauty!
Thank you so much!

246
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,234
Are you gonna ride into town
with me or not?

247
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,738
Go on without me. I'm gonna wait,
'cause I think she's gonna sing.

248
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,033
Her? She ain't gonna sing.
She don't sing unless she get paid.

249
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,660
I'd like to thank you...

250
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,371
for coming out
to greet me today.

251
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,458
It's great to be home.
It's hot as a firecracker.

252
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,378
What's so funny about that?

253
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,089
Me and the boys are gonna be
out at the Opry this week...

254
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,759
and like my granddaddy
always used to say...

255
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,762
if you're down to the river,
I hope you'll drop in.

256
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,181
Oh! Yes, that's sweet.

257
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,308
Who writes your material, darlin'?

258
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,187
Barnett, who are
all those people inside?

259
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,440
It's just airport security,
'cause of all the hijackers.

260
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,652
- Did they come to see me?
- They can see you pretty good.

261
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,571
Then I'd like to go in
and say hello.

262
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,615
I believe
Barbara Jean wants to go inside...

263
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,701
- Barnett, I'm sorry, darlin'.
- To see the fans who were not able...

264
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,703
to make it out here.

265
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,873
This was a little bit unscheduled.
She's on her way down there...

266
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,418
probably to greet
some fans inside there.

267
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,881
- Stepping down the walkway with Barnett.
- Watch out for the water.

268
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,092
Right behind, Haven Hamilton...

269
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,011
and all the other friends,
members, and, uh...

270
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,264
She's fallen! Harold, come on!

271
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,182
She's fallen somewhere
down there.

272
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,060
If we can get down there...
if we have enough cable.

273
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,272
Don't know how far
we can make it.

274
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,775
Who do you think is running Congress?

275
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,945
Farmers? Engineers?
Teachers? Businessmen?

276
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,992
No, my friends.
Congress is run by lawyers.

277
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,620
A lawyer is trained for two things
and two things only:

278
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,873
To clarify... that's one...

279
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:11,251
And to confuse...
that's the other thing.

280
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:15,422
He does whichever
is to his client's advantage.

281
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,425
Did you ever ask a lawyer
the time of day?

282
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,261
He told you how to make
a watch, didn't he?

283
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:25,265
Ever ask a lawyer how to get
to Mr. Jones's house in the country?

284
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,809
You got lost, didn't you?

285
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,813
Congress is composed
of 535 individuals.

286
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,775
Two hundred and eighty-eight
are lawyers.

287
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:40,030
And you wonder
what's wrong in Congress.

288
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,991
No wonder we often know
how to make a watch...

289
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,827
but we don't know
the time of day.

290
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,748
No wonder it takes six or seven years...

291
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,339
What the hell
is the matter with you?

292
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:13,104
Yes, I'm talking about replacement.

293
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,524
Replacing this lawyeristic,
red-taped...

294
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,693
and blank-taped government...

295
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,488
with the yes-and-no language
of farmers and teachers...

296
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,698
engineers and businessmen.

297
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,951
I'm not pessimistic
about this country.

298
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:29,037
She finally collapsed here
on the sidewalk. Sort of a faint.

299
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:32,165
That's all we've been able
to determine at this moment.

300
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,293
We interviewed Mr. Sperry.
He said the same thing.

301
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,587
Haven Hamilton
said the same thing as well.

302
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,674
That's about it for the moment
from Metro Airport.

303
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,010
For Channel Two News,
this is Bill Jenkins reporting.

304
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,471
Let's consider our national anthem.

305
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,556
Nobody knows the words.

306
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,767
Nobody can sing it.

307
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,103
Nobody understands it.

308
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,402
Yee-haw!

309
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,204
I suppose
all the lawyers supported it...

310
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,707
because a lawyer
wrote the words...

311
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,875
and a judge wrote the tune.

312
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,335
Careful, Buddy.

313
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,754
- Read it carefully.
- Watch out for that truck.

314
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,757
And I say "read it"
because I know you can't sing it.

315
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:27,137
Read all four verses, and you'll
understand what I'm talking about.

316
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,724
Yes, sir, I would support work
and vote for replacement.

317
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,437
- Change our national anthem back
to something people can understand...
- This is terrific, Norman.

318
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,607
Back to something that would make
a light shine in their faces.

319
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:43,069
Hey, man, get off my car!
Don't lean on my car!

320
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,823
I just got this goddamn thing fixed,
so don't lean on it.

321
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,702
Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, God.

322
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,787
Hey, man,
get the hell off my car!

323
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,914
You almost made me fall!

324
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,126
Great, thanks.
Can I have one too?

325
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,004
Thanks a lot. Just keep those
cards and letters comin' in, folks.

326
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,965
- I feel faint.
- I'm gonna get us a Popsicle.

327
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,009
Just a minute. Hello?

328
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,803
- All those mangled bodies.
- Would you go to that Popsicle truck...

329
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,972
and get us a couple sweet ices?

330
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:15,185
There must be 20 cars piled up,
one on top of the other,
some of them upside-down.

331
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,353
- Come on.
- I saw a leg sticking out.

332
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,274
This is gonna be a mess.
I don't know how long it...

333
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,486
Can you just pull on through
where the ambulance went?

334
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,488
You want to try it?

335
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,698
- What's the matter, son?
- It's stalled.

336
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,993
- What did you want? Popsicle?
- I wish my cameraman had been here.

337
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,622
He's never around. I need something
like this for my documentary.

338
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,707
I need it.
It's... It's America.

339
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,751
Those cars
smashing into each other...

340
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,836
and all those
mangled corpses...

341
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,213
Just a minute.
Just a minute.

342
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,427
Well, it's hard to really say.

343
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,554
You see...

344
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,849
after they opened her up, they figured
they ought to do an exploratory.

345
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,227
You know,
give her kind of an overhaul.

346
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,187
- Twenty dollars?
- Twenty dollars.

347
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:03,066
- I'll give you five.
- No, I'll take 15.

348
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,235
You'll take 15?
I'll give you ten.

349
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,029
I can think
of no sensible reason why New York...

350
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,407
must of necessity have 12,000...

351
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,409
major crimes committed...

352
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,871
for every 1,000
committed in Tokyo.

353
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,708
- Excuse me.
- Yet these are the true victims.

354
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,339
Some very funny notions
have developed in American politics.

355
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,299
Um, let me see.

356
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,552
Um, have you any children?

357
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,888
Yes, I have two children.
I have a boy and a girl.

358
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,891
Oh, isn't that nice!
How old are they?

359
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,935
Twelve and 11.

360
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,312
Do they want to be singers
like their mummy?

361
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,732
Um, well,
my children are deaf.

362
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,445
They're... They are deaf.
They were born deaf.

363
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,573
Oh, my God, how awful!

364
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,951
- It's so depressing.
- Now, just a minute. That's not so.

365
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,037
- I wish you could see my boy.
- Oh, I couldn't.

366
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,790
- He has the most incredible personality.
- It's the sadness of it.

367
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,794
What happened is, he made
a million dollars on a flyswatter...

368
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,213
because it had
a red dot in the center.

369
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,841
- Flyswatter?
- That's right. Just a red dot.

370
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:13,011
He was sittin' in a buffet,
and he was eatin'...

371
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,431
and he saw a woman,
and she was swattin' flies.

372
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:19,017
And, uh, she...
He said...

373
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,228
"What makes
the difference in flyswatters?"

374
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,315
'Cause it has to do
with the Industrial Revolution.

375
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:29,444
The thing with these country people is
they have a real grassroots appeal.

376
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:33,239
- Well, hell, they got fans.
- And they're the people
that elect the president.

377
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,492
- We're gonna do everything we can.
- You line up a lot of movie stars...

378
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:40,538
I think people here feel that
movie stars are eccentric and crazy.

379
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,790
- Communists.
- Well...

380
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,210
- A lot of 'em are.
- It's been said, now.

381
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:48,796
- Then I want to go to the Grand Ole Opry.
- Forget that.

382
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,549
- 'Cause I have to have my record...
- I don't like music.

383
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,552
- I'm gonna go see what's goin' on.
- I have a gold record...

384
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,931
- and it needs to be signed.
- Get the hell away from my truck!

385
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,517
- Goddamn it! Sons of bitches!
- Shit!

386
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,354
I say, could I please speak
to Mr. Tommy Brown?

387
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,940
- What?
- I'm sorry.

388
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,109
Is it possible to have a few words
with Mr. Tommy Brown?

389
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:13,404
I'm from the BBC. I'm doing
a documentary on Nashville.

390
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,490
What is the BBC?

391
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,825
- British Broadcasting Company.
- Oh, English.

392
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,953
It was called
"Wanda, Wander."

393
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,122
No, that song was called
"Wonder, Wanda."

394
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,510
- I don't really know.
- Thank you, thank you.

395
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,012
- Goddamn it, it was "Wanda, Wander."
- It was "Wonder, Wanda."

396
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,808
"Wanda, Wander"! What difference
does it make? It was a hit!

397
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,852
There's no breathing space.

398
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,188
What we need,
first and foremost...

399
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,524
is a commonsense approach.

400
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,526
Nothing complicated.

401
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:55,405
Is Mr. Brown going to...
Will he be here soon?

402
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,658
Yeah, he's in the back changin'.
He has to put his makeup on.

403
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,661
Whenever he's going to have
an interview, he puts his makeup on...

404
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,038
and likes to get
all prettied up, you know?

405
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,040
That's nice.

406
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,042
He must be
a marvelous person...

407
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,878
to have all you lovely people
working for him.

408
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,465
I know the problems in the South.
I mean, I've heard of them.

409
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,759
Well, yeah.

410
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,138
- He's a very liberal guy.
- That's lovely.

411
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,725
By the way, I'd like for you
to meet his wife. This is Joy.

412
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,060
- Mrs. Brown?
- Yes.

413
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,698
Today in America...

414
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,034
with its unmatched resources...

415
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,494
it is exceedingly ridiculous...

416
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,997
a total absurdity...

417
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,374
that any citizen with any ailment...

418
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,836
mental or physical,
should go medically unattended.

419
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,796
We're settin' up
everything for you.

420
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,467
- We got pictures the right height.
- Oh, the little bird again.

421
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,136
Isn't that beautiful?
I remember when you gave that to me.

422
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,388
I remember I almost threw it out.

423
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,557
Good afternoon, girls.

424
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,853
I'd like you to wait
outside the room a while...

425
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:12,106
because I know Aunt Esther
would like to fix herself up a little.

426
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,275
I want my dog.
Where is my dog?

427
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,157
- I just need one shot.
- I'm sorry.
- Could you excuse us?

428
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:24,118
- Come on in, sir.
- How you doin', Howard?

429
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,578
I'm sorry.
No press allowed.

430
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,747
We'll put
these pictures above your head.

431
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,957
- Delbert, I got no time.
- I know.

432
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,126
I just stopped by
to see Barbara Jean.

433
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,836
How you doin'?
How's lawyerin'?

434
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,964
Nobody pays me no mind.
I'm just like another flunky.

435
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,217
- Would you mind crankin' me up?
- More white carnations!

436
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,469
If I told him once,
I told him twice.

437
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,514
Bud, this is a hospital!
This ain't no construction site!

438
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,975
- I am not the press.
- Go build another chair!

439
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,769
Goddamn it!

440
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,188
I am not the press.
I am from the BBC.

441
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,023
Damned if I don't
keep my pledge.

442
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:58,152
- Look who's here... Mr. Brown.
- Glad you're here, but cut it short.

443
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,321
How do you do?
Nice to see you.

444
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,199
You look as beautiful
as a big, black butterfly.

445
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,785
I'm gettin' jealous.
I'm gettin' jealous.

446
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,621
- You better get out of here.
- He's gettin' mighty jealous.

447
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,291
I gotta sit myself up a bit. Hi.

448
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,169
- I need to talk to you.
- You got it.

449
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,380
All right, everybody.
Doctor's gotta talk turkey.

450
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,757
Barnett, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

451
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,176
- John Triplette from California.
- John Triple?

452
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,845
- Triplette.
- Okay. All right.

453
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,889
- He's a killer.
- Give us some good news.

454
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,850
Excuse us, please.

455
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,352
- Are you a relative?
- What? No, no.

456
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:35,189
- Can you tell me how she is?
- She's fine. It's her husband
I'm concerned about.

457
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,651
- Now, say somethin' good.
You got two seconds.
- Fair.

458
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,862
- Can I have a light?
- Excuse me?

459
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:44,449
- Can I have a light?
- Yeah, sure.

460
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:47,034
The incident you described
just now is very similar...

461
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,370
to what you have here
for your second admission...

462
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,874
- when it was diagnosed as some kind of intestinal disorder.
-  - What's your name?

463
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,042
Bud Hamilton's my name.

464
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,795
Esther's awake,
and she's dying to see you.

465
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,757
I'll be there in a minute, okay?
I'm talking to someone right now.

466
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,843
- I'm talking to someone.
- I beg your pardon.

467
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,888
- That's my uncle.
- Your uncle?

468
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,056
I've got a sick aunt
down the hall.

469
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,517
I just got in from Los Angeles
a few hours ago.

470
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,769
- I'm L.A. Joan.
- L.A. Joan?

471
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,354
What do you do?

472
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,398
Well, I know it sounds arrogant...

473
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,359
but I'm on my way to town,
if I ever make it...

474
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,570
to become a country-western
singer or a star.

475
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:23,905
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

476
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,907
What are you gonna do
if you don't?

477
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,911
If I don't? I don't know.
I could always go into sales.

478
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,039
- Like ladies' clothes?
- I don't know.

479
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:37,084
Well, I know all about trucks,
so I'd go into trucking, I guess.

480
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,962
- You're kiddin' me.
- No, I'm not kiddin' you.

481
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,048
I'm in a truck enough.

482
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,467
And I know
how to fix motors and all that.

483
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,428
- Nobody'd buy trucks from a girl.
- I been fixin' motors a long time.

484
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,847
They'd buy 'em from me
'cause I know all about motors.

485
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,058
Why do you say that?
Because now...

486
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,311
See, what's happenin' is, if I can't
sell trucks and I can't go...

487
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,439
- Nobody'd buy a truck from a girl.
- I knew this would happen.

488
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,192
Don't say you saw me.

489
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,114
Hey, you haven't seen
my wife, have ya?

490
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:10,326
- She's sort of an ordinary-lookin' lady.
- Huh-uh.

491
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,829
- Are you going into town?
- You're not one of them
country singers, are ya?

492
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,707
- No. Can you give me a ride?
- All right, get in.
- Thank you.

493
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,709
You look like a guy
I was in the navy with.

494
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,837
He wouldn't take a bath. We had
to pee in his bed to get him discharged.

495
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,301
Hi.

496
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,637
My name's Sueleen Gay...

497
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:36,310
and I'm here to sing you all a couple
of songs tonight that I wrote.

498
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,482
And I sure hope
you're gonna enjoy 'em, honey...

499
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,152
'cause I know I'm gonna
enjoy singin' 'em to ya.

500
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,239
The first one I'm gonna sing
tonight is called...

501
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,366
"Let Me Be The One."

502
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,868
Let's go.

503
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:56,038
Oh, what about your...
your aunt and uncle?

504
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,833
Oh, it's cool.
I can see them anytime.

505
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,504
- What kind of car you got?
- I have a little... Here.

506
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,131
Martha!

507
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,553
And, uh...

508
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,847
that... that being true...

509
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:16,684
I would suggest,
on the basis of the first account...

510
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,106
How come you're not
wearing the blue dress?

511
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,275
Because I didn't want to.

512
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,070
You're supposed to wear
the blue dress when I wear this.

513
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:12,948
- I don't want to dress
like twins anymore.
- We're not twins. We're a trio.

514
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,662
Hi, young stud.
Come on in, sit down...

515
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,455
right over here.

516
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,794
Yeah! Whoo.

517
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,421
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to...

518
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,215
That's okay.

519
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,677
He looks like Howdy Doody.

520
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,097
Okay, this is, uh...

521
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,973
Right here at Deemens Den.

522
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,310
- Hi, everybody. My name's Sheila.
- And my name's Patti.

523
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,688
And we're
the Smokey Mountain Laurel.

524
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:22,727
Come on, Becky, let's go.
It's gettin' late.

525
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,937
I gotta get up and go...

526
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,148
Sorry. Oh! Tom!

527
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,983
- Yeah?
- Tom, hello.

528
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,651
Another one of his girlfriends.

529
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,612
I was looking for you.
This chap told me you were in here.

530
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,158
- Who are you?
- I'm Opal from the BBC. Hello.

531
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,868
Good evening, ladies.

532
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,829
You don't mind
if I sit down for a little bit.

533
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,293
All right.
I want to hear it some more...

534
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,837
for my Misty Mountain Boys!

535
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,595
I got a couple announcements
I wanna make.

536
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:00,097
We got some stars here tonight.

537
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,433
- Can't be us.
- And one of 'em is...

538
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,435
Tommy Brown's back in town!

539
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:08,022
Tommy Brown,
stand up and show it all off!

540
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,525
Oh, ain't he beautiful!

541
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,402
Tommy Brown's
the whitest nigger in town!

542
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,196
It's gettin' late.

543
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,072
- I'm very sorry.
- That marshmallow!

544
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,409
He oughta drink some
of that milk! It fits his personality!

545
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,204
This is not typical of Lady Pearl's
parlors, you understand.

546
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,499
It's not typical of Nashville.
I hope you'll tell the other ones.

547
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,751
Hey, he's leavin'!
The Oreo cookie's leavin'!

548
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,544
Calm down.
You're drunk.

549
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,631
I'm drunk, but shit, he's still
the whitest nigger in town...

550
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,802
and I ain't gonna change my mind
about that, I'll tell you right now.

551
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:41,222
Shit! Hey, where you goin',
Tommy Brown?

552
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,140
Come on back here!

553
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,352
Hey, get your hands off...

554
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,897
Listen, boys!
I got two guns here!

555
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,910
- How'd we do, Trout?
- Not bad, girls.

556
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,079
Go sit down.
I'll talk to you in a minute.

557
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,914
Send over a couple of beers.

558
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,000
Bear, how about a couple beers
for the ladies, huh?

559
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,837
- Honey, what's your name?
- Sueleen.

560
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,755
- Sueleen?
- Sueleen Gay.

561
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,091
Sueleen Gay,
you're on next.

562
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:19,093
Come on, Bunkie.

563
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,015
One, two, three, four.
Un, deux, trois, quatre.

564
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,101
Testing. Testing.
Un, deux, trois, quatre.

565
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,937
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Wait for me here.

566
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,857
The kind of guys
that go for this Hal Phillip Walker...

567
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,609
longhairs and smoke
cigarettes that look funny.

568
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,403
I heard this guy's
an admitted homo.

569
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,743
and I'm here to sing y'all
a couple songs I wrote.

570
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,289
First one I'm gonna do is called
"Let Me Be The One."

571
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,176
That's awful.

572
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:47,765
- You want a beer?
- No, thanks. This is business.

573
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,850
See, what I was wonderin'...

574
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,936
I'm makin'
a demonstration album...

575
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,813
at a recordin' studio...

576
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,649
- and, uh...
- Winifred!

577
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,610
- What? You...
- Goddamn it, come back here!

578
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,247
- Deemens Den.
- Is Trout around there?

579
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:15,834
- Yeah, this is Trout.
- Listen, this is Del Reese.

580
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,128
We're gonna have
a little fundraiser...

581
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,589
and we need
some help with some...

582
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,716
- Talent?
- Yeah, talent. Right.

583
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,760
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

584
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:28,305
The fella I'm working with is here.
I'm gonna put him on.

585
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,225
Maybe he can tell you
exactly what we need.

586
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,268
- John Triplette's his name.
- All right.

587
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,521
Uh, Trout.
This fella's name's Trout.

588
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,856
- Trout?
- Yeah.

589
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,900
- Hello, Trout?
- Hey, John, how are you?

590
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,527
- Fine. How are you?
- Fantastic.

591
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,697
- As Del told you,
we're putting a smoker together.
- Right.

592
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,074
I think next Monday night,
hopefully.

593
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,661
What we need is a young lady
to entertain the troops.

594
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:52,746
Hey, babes.

595
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:56,208
And then...

596
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,337
- What are you tellin'? Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

597
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,590
Set the table, please.

598
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,050
Hey, babe, I'm sorry...

599
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,803
you got stuck in that big
traffic jam out there today.

600
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,515
I have got
a saucy, saucy redhead...

601
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,100
- Saucy?
- Who is dynamite.

602
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,608
Why, in fact, her name
is "Suelynn" Gay.

603
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:25,738
Well, if she's half as provocative
as her name, we're home free.

604
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,908
I'm sorry I sprang
this dinner on you.

605
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,703
I asked the man
if he wanted to come to dinner...

606
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:36,290
- and he said yes.
- And then one boy pushed me out.

607
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,507
- Were you out there by yourself?
- Wasn't it hot?

608
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,718
- Thought I was gonna burn up.
- It was terrible.

609
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:51,263
We got in the car,
and I turned on the air conditioner.

610
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,599
Coach said, "Go in the water."
I said, "Okay."

611
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,643
- What you tellin', Jimmy?
- Talkin' 'bout swimming class.

612
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,521
- He's telling me about swimming class.
- Oh.

613
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,525
Did you swim today?
Did you learn anything?

614
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,445
- Huh?
- Hush! Let him tell it.

615
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,864
Then the coach said, "Ready?"

616
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,366
I said, "Yeah. Oh, boy."

617
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,705
Then I went down
to the diving board...

618
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,960
Whoo!
And touched bottom.

619
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,464
And I kept going through.
Walked on the bottom.

620
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,801
And then I come out.

621
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,386
Then I get two cards:

622
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,680
"Goldfish" and...

623
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,309
and "Passed the test."

624
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,353
How about that?

625
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,355
They call you Goldfish?

626
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,649
Goldfish. That's it.

627
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,985
Oh, dynamite! Dynamite!

628
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,238
Sueleen,
I'm so proud of you, baby.

629
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,532
- Thank you.
- You knocked 'em out up there.

630
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,160
- Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
- All the people were goin' crazy!

631
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,248
Darlin', you're outta sight!
You are outta sight! Oh, my goodness.

632
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,543
Oh, that's beautiful.
Honey, it takes an attitude to be a star.

633
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,587
- What can I tell you?
- Do I get the job, then?

634
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,132
Honey, I got you a job
while you were singin'.

635
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,926
- You did? Oh!
- A friend of mine called.

636
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,053
Very heavy.
There's a party Monday night.

637
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,972
Listen, the pay is not much...

638
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,850
- because it's a low-budget thing.
- I don't care about the money.

639
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,102
- It's only $10.
- I don't care about the money.

640
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,104
This must be
some sort of amateur night.

641
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,357
- You're gonna be a star.
- I gotta make a phone call.

642
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,025
I'll be right back.

643
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,112
They are good, babe.

644
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,531
- I can get that.
- You want me to get it?

645
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,783
- That's all right. Go on.
- Where you goin'?

646
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,577
- Telephone.
- Oh.

647
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,830
Mm! Hello.

648
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,540
- Hi. Linnea?
- Mm-hmm.

649
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,834
- I'm here.
- Who is it?

650
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,669
This is Tom.

651
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,922
Just a minute. I have something
in my mouth. I was eatin' dinner.

652
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,966
You haven't changed a bit,
have you?

653
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:54,094
- Now, who is it?
- Tom. Don't you remember?

654
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,430
No, I don't believe I do.

655
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,932
We met in the control room
at the recording studio...

656
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,934
about two months ago.

657
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,645
- Oh, yes. How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

658
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,232
I'm just fine.
What are you doin' in Nashville?

659
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,027
I'm gonna do some recording.
I'm here for a couple weeks.

660
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,987
I'd really like to see you.

661
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:15,782
Why don't you come out to the house?
The children would love to meet you.

662
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,411
It's not exactly
what I had in mind.

663
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,956
- Well...
- Look, I find you very attractive,
and I'd like to see you.

664
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:27,002
Well, I think it'd be fine if we had
dinner some night here at the house.

665
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,755
You've never met
my husband, Del, have you?

666
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,299
I see. You can't talk now.
I'll call you later.

667
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,302
I'm going home now.
I'll call you when I get there. Bye.

668
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,596
Uh, I'd like to...

669
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,556
Um...

670
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,143
Well, all right. I'll talk to you later.
Thank you for calling.

671
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,982
- He's done well in those primaries.
- He sure has.

672
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,984
That's the key to it.

673
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,986
Excuse me.
Who was it, babe?

674
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,489
Oh, down at
the recording studio.

675
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:58,033
I left some,
uh, music down there.

676
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,954
- What kind of a gun is it?
- A.38 Smith & Wesson police special.

677
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,207
Uh, this particular gun's
a stainless steel gun.

678
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,334
Did you ever have to shoot it?

679
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,504
Of course, we have to shoot it
to qualify on the range...

680
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,840
but I've never had
to kill anyone with it.

681
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:17,344
'Course, there's been occasions
where I have had to use it to...

682
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,386
See ya later, alligator.

683
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:11,023
- Am I too late?
- Well, Esther's asleep now.

684
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,734
She's looking forward
to seeing you in the morning.

685
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,488
If the chairman
of the board of your company...

686
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,574
had been running your business...

687
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,744
the way Washington
has been running our business...

688
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,163
you'd be asking
a lot of questions...

689
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:29,583
and you would find out
what you already know:

690
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:33,712
We have some problems
that money alone won't solve.

691
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,882
Now, I know something
about money.

692
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:40,761
Anybody who grew up without it
knows a lot about money.

693
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,263
I know more about money
than some of the rich...

694
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,600
because I never had any
until I was 27.

695
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,227
I know something
of what money can do...

696
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,188
and more important...

697
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,565
I know something
of what it can't do.

698
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,943
Does it make sense
to let the petroleum industry...

699
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,404
boost their prices at will...

700
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,949
- adding to an already staggering profit...
- Watch where you're going!

701
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:05,952
But tell the little filling station
owner in his khakis...

702
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,914
- he can't charge one penny more?
- What's wrong with you, you dope?

703
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,458
To tax the salaries of people
on poverty-level income...

704
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,960
- I don't need that shit, you stupid...
- then turn around...

705
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,421
and give back in food stamps...

706
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,840
twice the amount of the tax.

707
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,259
If there's any cleaning up
to be done...

708
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:23,637
we're going to have to do it.

709
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:28,266
The Lord is not going
to do the replacing...

710
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,268
and the powers that be...

711
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,437
are certainly not going
to replace themselves.

712
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,315
That old truth remains:

713
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,609
There is no such thing
as a free lunch.

714
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,363
- Hello.
- If the books are to be balanced...

715
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,074
we're going to have
to balance them.

716
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,993
- Yes, sir?
- You've got a room for rent?

717
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,372
Yeah, I'm Mr. Green.
That's me. I'm Mr. Green.

718
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,749
- I'd like to see it.
- What's your name again?

719
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:56,253
- Kenny. Kenny Fraiser.
- All right, sir, right this way.

720
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,296
Right in the back.
Go right through.

721
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:01,299
That's your room
straight ahead there, Kenny.

722
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,552
My wife's been in the hospital...

723
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:07,055
so the house is a little dusty,
but there's clean sheets on the bed.

724
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,016
It's fine.
It's like my room at home.

725
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,564
- The toilet's down at the end of the hall.
- Fine.

726
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,191
- You a musician?
- Yeah.

727
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,361
Well, now, my niece
is interested in music.

728
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,572
Martha!

729
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,866
This here is Kenny.
This is Martha.

730
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,201
- Hi!
- Hi.

731
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,704
She's from California.

732
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:33,039
- Uh, $13.50?
- That's right. $13.50 a week.

733
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,542
And you can have breakfast
with me if you want.

734
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,795
- Of course, you'll have
to help wash the dishes.
- That's fine.

735
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,922
Let me put this down,
and I'll pay you.

736
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,058
Good mornin'.
Barbara Jean, time to get...

737
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:56,146
- Excuse me.
I must have the wrong room.
- Who are you? I think you do.

738
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:58,523
Come on, Barbara Jean.

739
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,817
Time to get up.
Come on. Hi.

740
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,236
- Good morning, Louise.
- Did you have a nice rest?

741
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,030
Yeah.
I was just having a dream.

742
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:08,533
I know the political positions
are laughing...

743
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,621
but not quite as loud today
as they were yesterday.

744
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,251
Del, are you...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

745
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,128
You want me
to fry you an egg?

746
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:24,257
No, honey, I'm gonna
hard-boil me a couple eggs.

747
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,134
All right.

748
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,526
I was there
for about a year on a kibbutz.

749
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,570
I was feeling very romantic...

750
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,822
about that kind
of socialism at the time.

751
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,991
I thought I'd like
to have a bash at it.

752
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,457
- Hello.
- Can I talk to Linnea, please?

753
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,960
- Del, I'm on the phone. This is Linnea.
- Okay.

754
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,713
How are you? Listen,
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but...

755
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,841
- Who is this?
- This is Tom.

756
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:49,509
Tom who?

757
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,386
Oh, come on.

758
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,681
- Who is this? Tom who?
- This is Tom. Listen...

759
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:58,435
I don't know who you are,
why you're calling, and I want you to stop.

760
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:01,479
- Honey, you know you want to see me.
- I never said any such thing.

761
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,940
Don't you ever call here again,
and I'm not foolin'.

762
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,693
I mean it. Don't you ever call here again!

763
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,029
What's goin' on?
Hello? Linnea?

764
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,864
Hello?

765
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,537
Who was that, babe?

766
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,831
Just some crazy person
been callin' here.

767
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,834
Next time, get on the phone
and tell him you're gonna get the police.

768
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,628
Okay.

769
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,422
Come on.

770
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,066
Yeah, he wants that
in the cadaver room.

771
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,234
How do you get outside, please?

772
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,820
- You dial "9."
- Hi, Mr. Green.

773
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,365
Look at those flowers.
Did you grow those?

774
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,408
Esther and I did, yes.

775
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,953
My niece here picked 'em.
She's from California.

776
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,997
Oh, that's good.

777
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,751
They're so healthy.
Let me check and see if she's awake.

778
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:08,338
- I see no reason
why I can't use the phone.
- May I see your credentials?

779
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,757
- I'll be happy to show them to you.
- Hi.

780
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:18,098
Holy dog shit!
Will you look at that?

781
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,891
Must be some friends of Buddy's.

782
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,895
- Uh, Little Women.
- Little Women?

783
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,108
Ever since that Easy Rider movie,
that's the bike everybody's been drivin':

784
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,819
Long, low,
laid-back in the front.

785
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,738
- They're so dangerous, aren't they?
- They are.

786
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,951
Over here at the Baptist Hospital,
there's a whole ward of young boys...

787
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,453
the cutest, best-lookin' boys
you'd ever want to see...

788
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,622
just paralyzed
from the waist down.

789
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,416
Oh! Excuse me.

790
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:49,129
Thank you for the ride, darling.

791
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,589
- Break a leg.
- Have you passed the bar yet?

792
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,800
- Oh, yeah.
- Not that bar.

793
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:55,677
No, I know. Excuse me.

794
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:58,638
- Well, well, well. Young Hamilton!
- How are you?

795
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,974
- How are you?
- Fine, fine.

796
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,600
Give us a kiss, love.

797
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,644
You're a shy young man,
aren't you?

798
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:08,273
- Is your dad around?
- Uh, yes, but...

799
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,567
- Do you think I could have...
- Later.

800
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,652
A little chat with him?

801
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,739
He's kind of tied up right now,
but maybe you could...

802
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:19,617
- Is your mum around?
- No, as a matter of fact,
my mom is in Paris.

803
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:23,663
- This is Bergman!
- I like it. It's kind of nice.

804
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,875
Pure, unadulterated Bergman!
It's beautiful!

805
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,960
- Do you live here?
- Yeah, we do.

806
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,212
We've been here
for quite a while.

807
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,007
Lucky you! It's so gorgeous.
I've never seen...

808
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:37,302
- Of course, the people are all wrong
for Bergman, aren't they?
- Oh, yeah.

809
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,180
Well, I suppose
you're interested in horses.

810
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,140
Yeah, I like horses. Sure.

811
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,310
Honey, you should arrange for him
to visit one of our horse shows.

812
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:49,397
Haven breeds those famous
Tennessee Walkers you've heard about.

813
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:53,151
- Oh, really?
- Oh, Mr. Triplette knows all about walkers.

814
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,904
That is not the kind of walker
I had in mind.

815
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,697
- That's very fast.
- We have to be.

816
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,617
She had this most
horrible accident.

817
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:03,244
- Hi, Marie. How are you?
- How are you?

818
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,040
And she got a lick on the head
gettin' into a car...

819
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,626
one of those tiny cars,
her daughter's car.

820
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,711
This happened
almost a year ago.

821
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:15,340
No one had any idea this was gonna
develop into such a horrible thing.

822
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,467
Mr., uh, Triplette...

823
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,552
I'm real sorry
ole Delbert told you...

824
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,055
Haven would appear
at the political rally.

825
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,140
He knows better than that.

826
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,727
We never let Haven Hamilton
take sides politically.

827
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,522
You understand we give
contributions to everybody.

828
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,399
And they are not
puny contributions.

829
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:38,279
Only time I ever went
hog-wild around the bend...

830
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,323
was for the Kennedy boys.

831
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,325
Tsk.
But they were different.

832
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:47,288
- Yes, ma'am, they were.
- That's a fact.

833
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,415
Excuse me a minute.

834
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,836
Thank you, Brenda.

835
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:55,213
Is this party
somebody's birthday, or...

836
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,967
No, this is, uh...
I'm sure you've seen Haven Hamilton.

837
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,761
- No, I never heard of him.
- He's been a country-western star...

838
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,388
Do we get out here?

839
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,390
Let me, uh...

840
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,934
Let me get that door.

841
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,144
Listen, I wanted to ask...

842
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,189
Would it be all right
if I asked Mr. Gould a question?

843
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,776
- You want to ask me something?
- We're gonna be riding back with you.

844
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,695
Could we wait until then?

845
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,114
I just wanted to know
what you were doing in Nashville.

846
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,492
Just coming to a party.
What are you doing here in Nashville?

847
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,619
- I'm stuck here.
- Oh, yeah?

848
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:29,497
We'll see you in a bit.

849
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,000
Haven is singing tonight
at the Grand Ole Opry...

850
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,377
and this is just
a previous sort of party...

851
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,838
- Oh, yeah?
- For his friends.

852
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,132
He's got
a lot of photographers here.

853
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,551
What are you doing here, anyway?

854
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:45,388
I came on a date, and now I'm goin'
to the Grand Ole Opry.

855
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:48,141
How you gonna go
to the Grand Ole Opry?

856
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:50,476
- "How"?
- Yeah. You came with a date.

857
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,770
- Is he gonna take you?
- Huh? No.

858
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,773
They left.

859
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,318
No, I'm promoting a movie,
but I'm not making one.

860
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:02,030
- Are you a personal friend
of Mr. Hamilton's?
- Yeah, we're very good friends.

861
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,325
No, I'm not a singer.
I'm a businessman.

862
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:07,702
I take care
of all Dad's business.

863
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,121
- You're a businessman?
- Yeah.

864
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:14,000
With that face?
You can't be a businessman.

865
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,794
Yeah, I... I work with,
uh, Dad's company.

866
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:19,839
I take care of his records
and all of his business.

867
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,050
Anything that comes in
comes through me.

868
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,969
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's great. It really is.

869
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,263
Dad's wanted me
to do that all his life.

870
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,600
Haven, listen,
I'd be the last guy in the world...

871
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,895
to try and change your mind
about something you don't want to do...

872
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:37,190
but I'd like to explain a couple things
about what we're trying to do...

873
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,609
in this campaign
before you discount it altogether.

874
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:42,111
And somehow the blood...

875
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,864
began to drain
into behind her eyeball...

876
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,367
and the pressure caused
her eye just to bulge out.

877
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,744
It was all red.
It was just awful-lookin'.

878
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,371
Everybody thought
she was gonna lose her eye.

879
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,206
We still don't know
how it's gonna come out.

880
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,917
I don't know how
you're gonna feel about this...

881
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,794
but, uh...

882
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,879
Walker thinks that...

883
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:03,007
you'd make
a fine governor in this state.

884
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,051
He thinks the time's right.

885
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:07,261
He thinks the people
of Tennessee love you.

886
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:10,556
He knows they do.
He knows how you feel about them.

887
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,851
And he wants you
to know that...

888
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:17,438
should the time come
you want to run...

889
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,775
he'll be there with his organization
to back you all the way.

890
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,027
Elliot Gould,
Delbert and Linnea Reese.

891
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,362
- Del Reese.
- Mrs. Reese.

892
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:27,031
And Mrs. Dorster.
Elliot Gould.

893
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:31,911
You gonna be
at Opryland tonight?

894
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,330
Well, I...
I hadn't thought I would be.

895
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,416
Well, I'm gonna be
at Opryland tonight.

896
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,543
Oh, well, sure, I'll be there.
Sure.

897
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,670
Yes, I guess you will.

898
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,880
And that's when
I'll give you my decision.

899
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,591
Well, thank you so much
for thinking about it.

900
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,427
Terrific.

901
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,056
- Is Haven around?
- Yeah, right around the corner.

902
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:55,059
Would you check and see
if it's all right if we come?

903
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,812
- Yeah.
- I see him with other people.
Thank you, Del.

904
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,189
Do you want to be a singer?
Look at me.

905
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,400
- Look at me.
- I think everybody...

906
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,111
Dad wouldn't hear of it.
He really wouldn't. He...

907
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,613
But you want to be a singer.

908
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,366
- I know him. That's Elliot Gould.
- This guy?

909
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,911
- He's a really well-known actor.
- Oh, yes, with the curly hair.

910
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,914
Yeah. He was married
to Barbra Streisand.

911
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,167
- He's grossin' real big.
- You gotta be kiddin' me.

912
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:20,960
No. That girl that sang "People."

913
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:24,630
I just shook the man's hand
like he was somebody off the street.

914
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,468
- Delbert! Go over there
and bring him on over.
- Yes, sir.

915
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:32,138
- Oh, Delbert!
- We all walk on the street, Delbert.

916
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:35,266
Oh, Delbert.

917
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,311
Listen, you all come over.
Haven wants to meet you right away.

918
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:42,190
I didn't realize who you were
when we first were introduced.

919
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:44,317
You wrote a song?

920
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:47,236
Yeah, I wrote one song
in my life, and, uh...

921
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,447
- I'd love to hear it.
- Are you sure?

922
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,324
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

923
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,033
It's Elliot Gould!

924
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,244
Well, let me meet the movie star!

925
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,579
Lady Pearl, Elliot Gould.

926
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,749
- Haven Hamilton.
- Well, how do you do, Mr. Gould?

927
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,044
So nice to meet you. Welcome
to Nashville and to my lovely home.

928
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,548
- Elliot! Elliot Gould!
- What brings you here?
- Oh, hello.

929
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,716
- Hello!
- I'm just, uh...

930
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,468
How are you?
You look marvelous!

931
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,138
- Is this another unexpected guest?
- I'm Opal from the BBC.

932
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:57,181
Remember
the Cannes Film Festival?

933
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,059
No, of course you wouldn't.
How silly of me.

934
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,811
What are you doing...

935
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:05,731
- What am I doing in Nashville?
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

936
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:09,777
- I'm doing this documentary...
- Excuse me, but Mr. Gould
does not give interviews.

937
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,530
I don't know who you are
or what you're doing here...

938
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:15,741
but I will not tolerate rudeness
in the presence of a star.

939
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:17,535
Two stars.

940
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:20,204
Just take her, Delbert.
Thank you very much. Good-bye.

941
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,915
- Mr. Hamilton!
- It's gonna be all right.

942
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,750
- No, listen...
- Who are you?

943
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:27,545
Well, that's the price
of success, I guess.

944
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,046
Certainly is.

945
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,011
Go get a Goo Goo,
friends, and settle back...

946
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:38,055
for 30 of the goodest
minutes in radio...

947
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:40,016
the Goo Goo Grand Ole Opry!

948
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:42,518
It's sent your way
by the makers of Goo Goo...

949
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,937
the goodest candy bar
in the world...

950
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:49,400
and King Leo pure stick candy,
the candy that roars with flavor.

951
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,279
Now a big welcome, if you please,
for the Goo Goo man of the hour...

952
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:55,406
Tommy Brown!

953
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,515
Okay, this is it.

954
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:04,433
- This is it, all right.
- Yeah, all right.

955
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,644
- It's the new one!
- Yeah, I know.

956
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,146
- It's the new one, all right.
- Have you got the time?

957
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:10,606
Sure. Yeah. It's, uh...

958
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:36,257
All right!

959
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:40,136
I'm Del Reese, and I'm goin' back
to Haven Hamilton's group.

960
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:43,014
- Remember me?
- This young lady's with me here.

961
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,224
I'm being interviewed by her...

962
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,351
and I really gotta go
to the bathroom.

963
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,870
Oh, yeah! Thank you!

964
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,415
Thank you, Tommy.
Beautiful job, as always.

965
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:13,252
Say, Harold Weakly,
have you been on vacation yet?

966
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,504
Gosh, no.
I've been busier than a puppy...

967
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,798
in a room full of rubber balls.

968
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,259
And if you're like me,
all that hustling and bustling...

969
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,137
makes you want to sit down
and let the world go by...

970
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,473
while you enjoy
a Goo Goo candy cluster.

971
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,310
- Hey, Steve. She's with me.
- Excuse me. Can I help you?

972
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,355
- I'm with these people here.
- Do you have a backstage pass?

973
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,607
A pass?
They didn't need a pass.

974
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,317
You need a pass
to go backstage.

975
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:59,590
Go get a Goo Goo, the South's
favorite piece of candy for 62 years.

976
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,634
- You ready to do the song?
- Right.
- Okay.

977
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,688
I wouldn't worry
about killin' 'em. They're already dead.

978
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:17,650
- Yes, thank you.
- You're lucky to be alive.

979
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,944
Haven Hamilton!

980
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,029
Yeah.

981
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,620
Thank you. Thank you.

982
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,831
Thank you.

983
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,212
Excuse me.

984
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:42,716
Well, I want to thank you
for that wonderful, warm welcome.

985
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:46,011
And I'm sure
you meant to share it with...

986
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:48,347
with Bud Hamilton,
my son, who's here.

987
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,391
Stand up, Bud.

988
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:55,521
Isn't he somethin' else?

989
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,774
Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed.

990
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,486
God bless you, and thank you
so much for that warm welcome.

991
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:06,365
- How tall is that guy?
- Who?

992
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,701
- Today I'd like to do
a special treat for you...
- Haven.

993
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:11,579
- A brand-new song.
- Don't ever ask him that, John.

994
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:41,877
That's funny, because...
Oh, there's Connie White!

995
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,587
How are you, honey?

996
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,298
You know what?
You remember you signed my album?

997
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,635
Well, thank you
for coming to the show.

998
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:53,180
I have a song I wrote.
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

999
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,975
- That's fine.
- We'll just chat, you know, and...

1000
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,769
You remember what I wrote on
the program? Will you remember?

1001
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,648
- "I'm your friend. Connie White."
- I like your dress. I'm gonna get one too.

1002
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:05,818
But I like the gold one
with the be...

1003
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:09,113
you know, when you...
when you have no waist.

1004
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,888
Thank you. Thank you.

1005
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:20,309
- He's got the entire galaxy
on the back of his shirt.
- Thank you so much.

1006
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:23,937
And now I'd like to do
a special old favorite...

1007
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:26,231
the song that got me started
in this business...

1008
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:28,233
that's been so kind to me...

1009
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,277
a song you've loved
through the years...

1010
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,529
and one I'm sure
you're gonna love tonight.

1011
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,744
Thank you.

1012
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,701
Well, now, Wilton's goin'!

1013
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:21,286
Come on, Wilton!
Let's hear it for Wilton!

1014
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,261
You gettin' ready, Joe?

1015
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:47,980
Now everybody's goin'!

1016
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,187
Yes, sir!

1017
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:35,027
Well, thank you.
Thank you, and God love you.

1018
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:37,196
Thank you so much.

1019
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:40,699
Thank you.

1020
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:44,077
Of course, we want to send
very special wishes...

1021
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:46,163
and greetings
to our own Barbara Jean.

1022
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:47,664
I know most of you read...

1023
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,708
that she collapsed
out at the airport.

1024
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:51,668
She's in the hospital.

1025
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:54,046
She's in Vanderbilt Hospital
recuperating...

1026
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,882
and Barnett tells me
she really cried real tears...

1027
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,051
because she couldn't
be here with you tonight.

1028
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:02,679
But I hope you'll send some letters
and best wishes and prayers to her.

1029
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:06,767
That's Vanderbilt Hospital,
Nashville, Tennessee 27322.

1030
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:10,729
And you tell her
Haven told you to write.

1031
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:13,440
Now, as a special
stand-in for her...

1032
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,442
we have her dear friend
Connie White...

1033
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,861
who got out of the dentist's chair
this morning...

1034
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,863
where she was having
some root-canal work...

1035
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,574
and came all the way out here
to sing for you.

1036
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:25,369
Miss Connie White, who's a friend
not only of Barbara Jean's...

1037
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:27,037
but a friend
of yours and mine.

1038
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,039
A wonderful singer
in her own way...

1039
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,708
Miss Connie White!

1040
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,711
Come on out, Connie!

1041
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:39,716
- Hi, Del. How are you?
- I want you to meet John Triplette.

1042
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,553
You look so good.
Wonderful!

1043
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,138
Isn't she lovely, folks?
Isn't she beautiful?

1044
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:47,266
We might want to talk.

1045
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:49,560
- We'll talk about it later.
- Nice to see you.

1046
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:54,189
Well, who do we have here?

1047
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,443
- What is your name, honey?
- Paul Harris.

1048
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:00,362
Paul Harris.

1049
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:03,907
He's 13, he said.
And what's your name, honey?

1050
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:07,244
Last time I saw a dress like that,
I was headin' for the junior prom.

1051
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,162
You boys havin' a good time tonight?

1052
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:11,415
The girl fell out of the car.

1053
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:14,376
I want you to study real hard,
because just remember...

1054
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:17,796
any one of you can grow up
to be the president.

1055
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,237
Turn that off.

1056
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,281
Okay.
One more minute, darlin'.

1057
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:52,826
- Right now.
- She'll be through in a moment.

1058
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:55,537
I want you
to turn it off right now!

1059
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:57,330
It bothers me.

1060
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:59,875
It bothers me too,
but I gotta listen, don't I?

1061
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,169
- Why?
- Come on, now, honey.

1062
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:05,630
I gotta go to the King of the Road
and thank her for you.

1063
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,633
- Thank her?
- I gotta know what songs she sang.

1064
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,970
You can ask anybody.
You can call.

1065
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:14,973
You can send flowers.
You can send a message.

1066
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:17,142
Come on.
Don't get upset, now.

1067
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:20,145
You're makin' me ruin
my nail-polish job.

1068
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:26,026
Do I tell you how to sing,
darlin'? Hmm?

1069
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,779
Have I ever told you
how to sing a song?

1070
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:32,657
That ain't the point.
I know why you're goin' over there.

1071
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:36,453
Don't tell me how to run your life.
I've been doin' pretty good with it.

1072
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,413
You go... Wh...

1073
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:40,832
Let's calm down.
We're gettin' on each other's nerves.

1074
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,961
You're goin' to the King of the Road
so you can hobnob with everybody.

1075
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,714
- So I can do what? "Hobnob"?
- I ain't got no friends.

1076
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,550
I gotta sit here
in this goddamn hospital.

1077
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:54,513
- They're all gonna talk
about how I'm a nut.
- I ain't doin' no hobnobbin'.

1078
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,598
Now, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1079
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:59,476
"Barbara Jean had another collapse."

1080
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,188
You know what?
While you're at it...

1081
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:06,191
why don't you take her
some of my flowers?

1082
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:08,985
- Are you through?
- No, I ain't through.

1083
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:13,031
- Are you through, darlin'?
- Take her this nice black one.
That'll cheer her up.

1084
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,534
- Why don't you try these?
- Are you through?

1085
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:18,870
- And these.
- I said, are you through?

1086
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,331
And why don't you try these?
And this...

1087
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,042
Are you through, I said?
Are you through...

1088
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,462
Are you goin' nutsy on me?

1089
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,840
'Cause I won't stand for that,
Barbara Jean.

1090
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,884
Huh? You havin' one of them
nervous breakdowns again?

1091
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,886
- Huh?
- No.

1092
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:38,014
You could've fooled me,
'cause it looks like you're ready for it.

1093
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:41,226
You just settle down and shape up.
You understand?

1094
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:44,312
The only reason I'm goin' over there
is 'cause I love you.

1095
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,399
I don't love to go over there
and hobnob with them phonies.

1096
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:51,570
Why do you make me
raise my voice to you?

1097
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,905
Why do you put us both
through this?

1098
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:56,366
Are you all right?

1099
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,873
Come on, now.
Let's have a little smile for Barnett.

1100
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:05,458
- I'm tired of this place.
- Come on, now.

1101
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:07,294
Come on, now.
Get up.

1102
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,505
You help me, I help you.
All right? Come on, now.

1103
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:12,215
Come on.

1104
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:16,011
Now, where's Barnett goin'?

1105
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:19,264
Where am I goin'?
Hmm?

1106
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:22,100
- King of the Road.
- And why am I goin' there?

1107
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:26,938
- To see Connie.
- And why am I doin' that?

1108
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:29,149
To thank her
for singin' at the Opry.

1109
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:32,277
- Who am I doin' that for?
- You're doin' it for me.

1110
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:34,029
That's right.

1111
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,493
Now, I'm walkin' out now.

1112
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,621
What do you say?
You say "bye-bye."

1113
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,039
Bye.

1114
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:45,624
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1115
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:59,095
Barnett?

1116
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,308
- Hello, Ben.
- Hi.

1117
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:11,483
Aren't they wonderful?
So marvelous.

1118
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,838
What are you upset about?

1119
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:36,716
She's really late.

1120
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:40,804
- Well, she's not that late.
- No, she's late.

1121
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,181
- Thank you.
- He's right over there.

1122
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,187
I thought you were
very, very good tonight.

1123
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:52,148
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1124
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:54,609
She sounded beautiful.
She looked beautiful.

1125
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,237
Well, Sue,
I didn't expect to see you.

1126
01:16:57,363 --> 01:17:00,115
- I wanted you to meet Julie Christie.
- Well, excuse my back.

1127
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:02,951
- So nice to see you.
- Did you see Doctor Zhivago?

1128
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:06,246
- She the one that got off the train?
- Will you be here a while?

1129
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,290
- No, just passing through.
- Please sit down.

1130
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:11,293
- Do sit down and have a drink with us.
- We're not staying.

1131
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:13,253
You're English, aren't you?
I could tell.

1132
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,338
Look at her.
Isn't she lovely?

1133
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,924
- This is such a coincidence.
- I'm Del Reese.

1134
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,719
Yes. I was talkin' about
the Christy Minstrels just this mornin'...

1135
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,846
and now we have
Julie Christie here.

1136
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,724
- I met you with Peter Finch.
- Oh, yeah?

1137
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,059
- You won't sit down and stay?
- No, thank you.

1138
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:31,813
- Julie has a friend at the Exit/In.
- I hope your stay is very nice...

1139
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:34,733
and I hope you'll remember what film
facilities we have in Nashville.

1140
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,818
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thank you. Good to see you.

1141
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:39,571
- Have a lovely evening. Good-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1142
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:42,032
Nice to see you.
Well, isn't that an honor?

1143
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,410
- What a surprise. Julie Christie.
- Who's Julie Christie?

1144
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:49,581
"Who's Julie Christie?"
She's a famous star.
She's won the Academy Award.

1145
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:52,000
- Oh!
- No, I'm not kiddin'.

1146
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:55,337
She got it for one of those pictures.
I don't know which one.

1147
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:57,464
- She's done so many.
- Isn't he a gem?

1148
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:00,884
- He's got the worst sense of humor.
- No, she's lovely.

1149
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,969
Come on.
She can't even comb her hair.

1150
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:06,264
Oh, you've got
a Hal Phillip Walker button.

1151
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:09,184
No, it's Kennedy.
Isn't that rather ancient?

1152
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:15,273
How strange! I thought everybody
in the South didn't go for Kennedy.

1153
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:19,444
It's John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

1154
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:22,947
Well, he...

1155
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,991
he took the whole South...

1156
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:28,620
except for Tennessee,
Florida, Kentucky.

1157
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:32,957
And there's a reason
he didn't take Tennessee.

1158
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:37,212
But he got 481,453 votes...

1159
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:42,634
and the asshole
got 556,577 votes.

1160
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,970
I just can tell.
It's something...

1161
01:18:46,097 --> 01:18:48,014
It's the way she looks at me.

1162
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,810
You know that feeling you get
that there's somethin' else going on?

1163
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:56,189
And if I do a performance
when I'm too tired, it doesn't have...

1164
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:59,025
- Hey, y'all.
- Hi, Barnett.
- How are you, Connie?

1165
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,529
Now, the problem we got here...

1166
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:06,032
is anti-Catholicism.

1167
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,869
These dumbheads
around here, they're all...

1168
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,664
Baptists and whatever,
I don't know.

1169
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:16,543
Even to teach 'em
to make change over the bar...

1170
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,337
you gotta crack their skulls...

1171
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:22,674
let alone teach 'em
to vote for the Catholic...

1172
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:25,093
just because he happens
to be a better man.

1173
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,430
Here, this is just somethin'...

1174
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:31,182
somethin' that Barbara Jean
told me to pick up for you.

1175
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,935
- You shouldn't have.
- I know, but she told me.

1176
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:37,439
- I told her I shouldn't have.
- Did you get the flowers we sent?

1177
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,405
Thank you.

1178
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,115
Appreciate it.

1179
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:50,452
Thank you very much.
As most of you might have noticed...

1180
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,871
we have a celebrity
with us tonight.

1181
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,874
If we get our hands together,
we might can get a song.

1182
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:59,252
- Miss Connie White.
- From the goodness of her heart.

1183
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,588
What do you want, a few bucks?

1184
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,965
Huh? You holdin' out
for somethin' better?

1185
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,968
She's a real sweetie pie.

1186
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,055
Thank you very much.

1187
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:17,353
That's what I love about this place.
Can you see me? I can't see you.

1188
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,440
- That was a nice gesture.
- I'm gonna sing something y'all know.

1189
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:23,026
- What was a nice gesture?
- Join me on the choruses.

1190
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:24,861
Don't seem to be
appreciated, do it?

1191
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,988
"Rolling Stone."

1192
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,241
Thank you.

1193
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,101
Everybody!

1194
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:06,194
And all I remember
the next few days was...

1195
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:10,031
I was just lookin'
at that TV set and seein' it all...

1196
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:14,202
seein' that great
fat-bellied sheriff...

1197
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:17,247
sayin',
"Ruby, you son of a bitch."

1198
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:19,624
And Oswald...

1199
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:22,460
and her in her little pink suit.

1200
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,218
Here's the best.
Here's Vassar.

1201
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:46,401
And then comes Bobby.

1202
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:48,444
Oh, I worked for him.

1203
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:51,948
- Don't you think we...
- I worked here.
I worked all over the country.

1204
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:55,326
I worked out in California,
out in Stockton.

1205
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:59,372
Bobby came here and spoke,
he went down to Memphis...

1206
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,916
and then he even went out
to Stockton, California...

1207
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:05,587
and spoke off the Santa Fe train
at the old Santa Fe depot.

1208
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:08,464
Oh...

1209
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:10,800
he was a beautiful man.

1210
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:13,595
He was not much like...

1211
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:15,638
uh, John, you know.

1212
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:19,017
He was more puny-like.

1213
01:22:19,143 --> 01:22:21,853
But all the time
I was workin' for him...

1214
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:23,938
I was just so scared.

1215
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:26,482
Inside, you know?
Just scared.

1216
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:30,987
Haven, do you think we could
get Connie out to the rally?

1217
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:35,366
Connie White and Barbara Jean never
appear on the same stage together.

1218
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:38,536
Connie can replace Barbara Jean,
but that's it.

1219
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,123
As for Haven Hamilton, well...

1220
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,959
I'll appear wherever
Barbara Jean appears.

1221
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:51,341
I got a good mind to take you outside.
With my wife in the hospital,
you puttin' that shit on me?

1222
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,218
Calm down, Barnett.
Calm down, enjoy the show.

1223
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,679
- Barnett's angry.
- Okay.

1224
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:05,355
I think she's having an affair here.
I really do.

1225
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:18,868
You are way, way off.

1226
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,953
Are you kidding?

1227
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:09,168
I love you.

1228
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,795
I love you.

1229
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:04,742
And on the profession
of your faith...

1230
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:07,078
I baptize you, my sister...

1231
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:10,498
in the name of the Father
and of the Son...

1232
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:12,667
and of the Holy Ghost.

1233
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:14,043
Amen.

1234
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:36,250
is on the same floor
with Barbara Jean.

1235
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:42,506
in the service too.

1236
01:27:42,633 --> 01:27:45,468
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, not the army. It was the navy.

1237
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:51,015
We lost him in the South Pacific.
We don't know how.

1238
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,100
Sorry to hear that, sir.

1239
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:55,311
- World War I I.
- Yes, sir.

1240
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:16,207
I'm wandering in a graveyard.

1241
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,001
The dead here have no crosses...

1242
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:23,297
nor tombstones, nor wreaths
to sing of their past glory...

1243
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:26,425
but lie in rotting, decaying...

1244
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,678
rusty heaps...

1245
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,972
their innards ripped out...

1246
01:28:31,098 --> 01:28:33,224
by greedy, vulturous hands...

1247
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:38,020
their vast, vacant skeletons...

1248
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,231
sadly sighing to the sky.

1249
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:45,069
The rust on their bodies...

1250
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:48,155
is the color of dried blood.

1251
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:49,865
Dried blood.

1252
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,828
I'm reminded of...

1253
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:58,416
of an elephant's
secret burial ground.

1254
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,209
Yes.

1255
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,712
Cet air de mystère.

1256
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,923
Cette essence de I'irréel.

1257
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:09,260
These cars
are trying to communicate.

1258
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:14,682
O cars, are you trying
to tell me something?

1259
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:18,477
- Are you trying to convey some secret...
- What? What? Excuse me?

1260
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:22,064
Oh, excuse me.

1261
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,650
I thought
I was completely alone.

1262
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:27,028
How embarrassing!
Oh, you're a musician!

1263
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:02,271
A round of applause
for Miss Daisy Hoy.

1264
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,657
Miss Albuquerque.

1265
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:18,329
Hi, Frog.

1266
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:26,253
This is with gestures.

1267
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:31,592
Miss Jill Brown
on the track in number 78.

1268
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:57,827
You wanna talk
about yesterday?

1269
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:02,456
Get up, goddamn it!

1270
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:07,128
You fucker!

1271
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,883
You wanna talk
about yesterday?

1272
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:16,846
Do you wanna talk about yesterday
or not? What are you...

1273
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:18,973
Shit.
Come out of there!

1274
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,808
You leave me alone!

1275
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:23,102
Come out of there!
Come on!

1276
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,855
Look, I know what's...
Come on!

1277
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:28,566
For Christ's sake, what...
Now...

1278
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:32,236
What are you doing?
You wanna talk about yesterday or not?

1279
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:35,447
Oh, that's terrific.
Hey, that's great. Hey, terrific.

1280
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:38,701
It's great. Oh, thanks.
My turtle. Thanks a lot.

1281
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:40,744
Look, just relax!

1282
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,415
Look, I know what's goin' on.

1283
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:48,502
Great.
House detective.

1284
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:52,590
Bill, hi.
I'm John Triplette.

1285
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,926
Am I early?
I called you this morning.

1286
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:59,180
- Oh, the guy from TV.
- Yeah. How are ya?
- Come on in.

1287
01:31:59,306 --> 01:32:01,557
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1288
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:04,351
Just... We're just
cleanin' up here.

1289
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:07,605
- You know, the...
- Sunday morning blues.

1290
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:09,857
- Would you hold this?
- Sure.

1291
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:13,777
Thanks. Let me just
move this over here.

1292
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:16,572
- Is this your new album?
- Yeah. That's our only album.

1293
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:19,033
It's a very good one, though.
I've heard it.

1294
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:21,202
- Oh, thank you.
- It's terrific.

1295
01:32:21,328 --> 01:32:24,079
- I'm really sorry about the mess.
- That's all right.

1296
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:26,207
You oughta see my room.

1297
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:30,252
We had a little party last night.
Had a pretty good time too.

1298
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:33,422
- Uh...
- I wanted to, um...

1299
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,967
tell you about what we're trying
to do with this show.

1300
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,094
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.

1301
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:42,223
- I could call down.
- I don't want to take up your time.

1302
01:32:42,349 --> 01:32:46,518
I just want to tell you a little bit
about what we're trying to do.

1303
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:50,773
I know you're astute politically,
and I'm certainly not here
to sell you a bill of goods.

1304
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:54,777
- Don't care. Don't care about politics.
- No politics? Okay, great.

1305
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:57,279
Let me tell you, then,
I've got a problem...

1306
01:32:57,405 --> 01:33:00,074
that I think could work
to your advantage.

1307
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:04,411
As you know, this redneck music
is very popular right now...

1308
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:07,373
and I've got an awful lot
of these local yokels...

1309
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:09,250
on the bill singing...

1310
01:33:09,376 --> 01:33:12,044
- Your basic country folk.
- Country crapola. Right.

1311
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,171
So I think, uh...

1312
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:17,341
What I'm going for
is a broader appeal.

1313
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:21,136
- Which is where we would fit in.
- More than just this Southern thing.

1314
01:33:21,263 --> 01:33:25,140
And I think that
a really hip group like yours...

1315
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:27,184
could walk off with the evening.

1316
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:29,687
Yeah. Probably the only
rock group on the...

1317
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:32,147
- Absolutely, yeah.
- Sounds good.

1318
01:33:32,274 --> 01:33:34,024
- Sounds inviting.
- Yeah.

1319
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,277
And I think
you do get a lot of...

1320
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:39,363
a big audience
from these country guys.

1321
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:41,365
Is this just network, or is it...

1322
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:43,409
It's better than network.
It's syndicated.

1323
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:45,661
They'll be showing it
for a year and a half.

1324
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:49,123
- Your glasses, sweetheart.
- Oh, thanks.

1325
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:52,209
This is my wife, Mary.
This is John Triplette.

1326
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:54,878
Sit down, dear. Go ahead.

1327
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:58,924
He's, uh... he's the fella
from the television show...

1328
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:01,468
that they're doing
for Hal Phillip Walker.

1329
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:06,181
That political thing going on.
He's offered us a spot.

1330
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:09,685
You're doing some great promotion
on that guy. All those buttons and...

1331
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:13,397
- Thank you. I'm trying.
- And bumper stickers.

1332
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:16,984
Anyways, we got
a great time spot on this gala...

1333
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:19,737
and we're gonna walk away
with the show, John says.

1334
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:22,656
We can't vote for him
because we're registered Democrats.

1335
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:25,159
And besides,
he's a little crazy, isn't he?

1336
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:29,621
Well, they're all a little crazy.

1337
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:32,416
- I'll drink to that.
- That's the name of the game.

1338
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:35,377
But I think the thing
you should consider is your future.

1339
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:38,255
It would give you a great shot.

1340
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:41,717
But it doesn't make any difference.
We're registered Democrats.

1341
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:44,219
Well, I'm a registered Democrat!

1342
01:34:44,346 --> 01:34:46,555
The only reason
we're registered Democrats...

1343
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,640
is because your father's
a registered Democrat...

1344
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:51,435
and his father's
a registered Democrat.

1345
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:54,104
Tom's a registered Democrat,
and he wouldn't do it.

1346
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,197
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi, Norman. How you doin'?

1347
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:07,117
Good. I'm sure glad you called.
Is there anything I can...

1348
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:09,078
- Sit down.
- Okay.

1349
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:14,666
- You don't have
any speckled birds, do you?
- What? Oh.

1350
01:35:14,793 --> 01:35:16,794
You know,
LA turnarounds. Uppers.

1351
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,962
Uh, no, no, I, uh...

1352
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,757
But I know where
to get some grass.

1353
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:24,885
- No, thanks. I don't need any grass.
- Okay.

1354
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:28,222
- Uh, can I ask you a question?
- Mm-hmm.

1355
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:31,058
Is there something...
Are you angry at Bill?

1356
01:35:31,184 --> 01:35:32,976
- No.
- Oh.

1357
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:35,354
'Cause I, uh...
You know, I, uh...

1358
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,023
Bill and Mary
and you and, uh...

1359
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:41,652
Well, Bill...
I mean, Bill seems to be, um...

1360
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:44,029
Uh...

1361
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:46,532
- I'm just confused.
- Mm.

1362
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:48,283
Uh...

1363
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:51,036
- Here, why don't you write yourself a hit?
- Okay.

1364
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:03,590
- Hello.
- Hi. Can I talk to Cherry, please?

1365
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:07,177
She's in bed with R.Y.
You wanna talk to R.Y?

1366
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:09,930
- I'd rather talk to her, if I could.
- Who is this?

1367
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:13,559
- This is Frank,
one of the cooks at the restaurant.
- Are you a Jehovah Witness?

1368
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:16,270
Does it make sense that the churches...

1369
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:20,482
should remain untaxed
on their vast holdings of land...

1370
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,943
and corporate investments?

1371
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:25,863
Does it make sense that
a multimillion-dollar income...

1372
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,824
should go untaxed
year after year?

1373
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,911
No, all will not be easy...

1374
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:35,831
but we will bask
in the satisfaction...

1375
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:39,543
of having done
what we should have done.

1376
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:42,671
And if we don't
get it done today...

1377
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:45,382
we may run out of tomorrows.

1378
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:47,676
The buses!

1379
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,678
The buses are empty...

1380
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:53,390
and look almost menacing...

1381
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:56,059
threatening,
as so many yellow dragons...

1382
01:36:56,186 --> 01:36:59,605
watching me
with their hollow, vacant eyes.

1383
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:02,608
I wonder how many little
black children and white children...

1384
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:04,651
have yellow nightmares...

1385
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:09,072
their own special brand of fear
for the yellow peril.

1386
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:12,159
I can't have...
I can't start...

1387
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:16,663
Damn it!
It's got to be more... positive.

1388
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:19,917
No, more negative.
Start again.

1389
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:23,253
Yellow is the color
of caution.

1390
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,713
No.

1391
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:28,550
Yellow is the color
of cowardice.

1392
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:32,179
Yellow is the color
of sunshine.

1393
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:35,098
And yet I see
very little sunshine...

1394
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:38,977
in the lives of all the little
black children and white children.

1395
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:42,189
I see their lives, rather,
as a study in grayness...

1396
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:43,857
a mixture of black and...

1397
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:46,527
Oh, Christ, no.
That's fascist. Oh!

1398
01:37:46,653 --> 01:37:49,404
Yellow, yellow, yellow.
Yellow fever.

1399
01:37:49,531 --> 01:37:53,784
I think we'll be able to talk about it.
They're checkin' out now.

1400
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:56,578
- Get together with him before he leaves.
- What about the place?

1401
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:59,081
- It's not bad at all.
- Think it'll work out?

1402
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:02,084
Yeah. It's got this bizarre stage
that drops out of the ceiling.

1403
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,794
- I know.
- Have you seen it?

1404
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,672
They're gettin' out this mornin'.

1405
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:08,966
- The place is very confused.
- Bye-bye!

1406
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:15,013
Wait a minute.
Here we go. Uh, Barnett?

1407
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:16,640
- Yes?
- Phone's for you.

1408
01:38:16,766 --> 01:38:18,475
- Is it important, or what?
- Bye, girls.

1409
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:20,227
- Hello.
- Hello, Barnett. John Triplette.

1410
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:22,145
Oh, are you...
Are you going...

1411
01:38:22,313 --> 01:38:25,482
Mr. Green, how are you?
I'm goin' home.

1412
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:28,360
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you. How is Mrs. Green?

1413
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:31,363
She's fine, and she's gonna be
thrilled I saw you again.

1414
01:38:31,489 --> 01:38:34,366
Give her my very best.
And is she takin' her vitamin E?

1415
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:36,827
- Got 'em right here.
- All right. Good for you.

1416
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:39,621
- You take care, darlin'. Bye-bye.
- Unbelievable.

1417
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:42,124
All right, come on.
Let's get her on there.

1418
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:50,674
We got to go with those
white horseshoes, huh?

1419
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,759
We're gonna live
with those for infamy.

1420
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:56,888
Take that on the other elevator.

1421
01:38:57,015 --> 01:38:59,099
Didn't the doctor
get ahold of you?

1422
01:38:59,225 --> 01:39:01,351
I'm really sorry
I have to tell you this.

1423
01:39:02,562 --> 01:39:05,188
Mrs. Green expired
this morning.

1424
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:08,567
What?

1425
01:39:08,693 --> 01:39:11,320
Mrs. Green died this morning.

1426
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,867
Wait right here.
Let me go get the doctor.

1427
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:20,370
Mr. Green?

1428
01:39:20,496 --> 01:39:23,457
Mr. Green, you know,
my mama saved her life.

1429
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:27,544
They used to live
next door to each other.
My mama put out the flames.

1430
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:29,880
She always loved Barbara Jean
more than anything.

1431
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:32,507
She's still keepin'
a scrapbook on her.

1432
01:39:32,634 --> 01:39:35,552
The only thing she said to me
when I joined up was...

1433
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:39,056
"Son, when you're doin' your travels,
I want you to see Barbara Jean.

1434
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:43,101
Don't say nothin' about me.
Just see Barbara Jean."

1435
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:45,020
So that's what I been doin'.

1436
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:48,315
Now I'm gonna go over
to Opryland and hear her sing.

1437
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,318
Give my best to your wife, now.

1438
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:00,744
Let me turn this...
Wait a minute. Don't laugh.

1439
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:02,788
I... Let me... Just...

1440
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:05,582
I have a theory
about political assassination.

1441
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:09,378
You see, I believe
people like Madame Pearl...

1442
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:13,924
and all these people here
in this country who carry guns...

1443
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:16,927
are the real assassins.

1444
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:20,222
Because, you see,
they stimulate other people...

1445
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:22,307
who are perhaps innocent...

1446
01:40:22,433 --> 01:40:24,893
and who eventually
are the ones who pull the trigger.

1447
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:28,397
- Mom?
- Kenny? Where are you, Kenny?

1448
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:30,899
- I'm in Nashville. How are you?
- I've been so worried.

1449
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:33,652
- There's no reason to worry.
- I haven't been able to sleep.

1450
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:37,155
I had to take some NyQuil
so I could go to sleep, you know?

1451
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:39,157
- Puts you right out.
- Did it help?

1452
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:41,910
Yeah, it did.
Where are you staying in Nashville?

1453
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:45,789
- I'm staying at a rooming house.
- Who you talkin' to?

1454
01:40:45,915 --> 01:40:48,041
- To my mother.
- Who are you talking to, Kenny?

1455
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:51,002
- A girl that lives in the rooming house.
- A girl that lives...

1456
01:40:51,129 --> 01:40:53,547
- Who owns that rooming house?
- Her uncle.

1457
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:56,883
A man owns the rooming house?
It can't be very clean.

1458
01:40:57,009 --> 01:41:00,137
- Don't be silly.
- I bet the sheets aren't clean.

1459
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:02,389
In the South
you can pick up this parasite...

1460
01:41:02,515 --> 01:41:05,142
- Joan, put that down, please!
- Kenny, listen...

1461
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:07,894
- Just a minute.
- Just wanted to look at your fiddle.

1462
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:11,398
Kenny! You can get
this parasite fungus in the South.

1463
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:14,484
It's difficult to get rid of.
When are you coming home?

1464
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:18,280
- I don't know. A couple of weeks.
- You left your blue suit in the closet.

1465
01:41:18,406 --> 01:41:22,576
- I don't need my blue suit.
- I would really like you
to get home as soon as you can.

1466
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:25,704
- I'm... been a little...
- Mother, just listen to me.

1467
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:28,999
Kenny, don't you talk to me
in that tone of voice.

1468
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:32,335
I love you too, Mama.

1469
01:41:34,213 --> 01:41:36,506
I really do.
I'll see you soon.

1470
01:41:39,177 --> 01:41:40,927
Bye-bye.

1471
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:17,547
Let's find Barnett.
I hope he's not in a bad mood.

1472
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:20,133
- Hey, Barnett.
- I'm obliged to you, but...

1473
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:23,011
- Hey, Barnett.
- What do you want now?

1474
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:26,014
This guy wants her to do four shows.
What do you want?

1475
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,767
Don't let her do too much.
How you hangin'?

1476
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:31,770
- You feelin' better she's better?
- Yeah, I feel swell.

1477
01:42:31,896 --> 01:42:35,357
We gotta talk to you.
We're gonna do a show.

1478
01:42:35,483 --> 01:42:37,400
Okay?
John's doing this show.

1479
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,070
Haven's gonna do it.
We want Barbara Jean to headline it.

1480
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:42,155
- Unbelievable.
- Now wait a second.

1481
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:44,991
I wish they wouldn't rush us.
Get a shot.

1482
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:47,452
It's for this candidate,
Hal Phillip Walker.

1483
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:51,581
We don't want her to make
any political statement at all.

1484
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:53,792
What do you think
her bein' there's gonna be?

1485
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:56,628
- Ain't that a political statement?
- People haven't seen her.

1486
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:59,422
No! No, fellas.
Don't take it personal.

1487
01:42:59,549 --> 01:43:02,509
No. No politics,
no government, no nothin'.

1488
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:04,469
- All right? Okay?
- All right.

1489
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:07,013
- I heard you all out.
- Hello, boys. How's it goin'?

1490
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:09,516
I believe I met you before
in the hospital.

1491
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:12,644
Look at that. Didn't Jewel
show you how to do her hair?

1492
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:14,145
- Come on, darlin'.
- How's it goin'?

1493
01:43:14,272 --> 01:43:16,773
- No pictures.
- I'm all excited. A little rushed, but...

1494
01:43:16,899 --> 01:43:18,108
- How do you feel?
- Great.

1495
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:20,819
I told the band you're gonna
start off with the cowboy song.

1496
01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:23,905
- Forget it.
- No, just leave it to me.

1497
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:26,116
He's crazy.
He can take a flying leap.

1498
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:28,535
I'm gonna stay after him
like a rodent, man.

1499
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:42,377
Thank you. Thank you.

1500
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,792
Have you been in Vietnam?

1501
01:47:50,923 --> 01:47:53,216
Yes, you have.
I can tell by your face.

1502
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:39,470
Was it awful?

1503
01:48:39,597 --> 01:48:42,056
It was...
It was kind of hot and wet.

1504
01:49:12,546 --> 01:49:18,635
Thank you.

1505
01:49:21,639 --> 01:49:25,391
I want to tell you all a little secret
you might not know...

1506
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:28,186
and that is that last night
I thanked my lucky stars...

1507
01:49:28,312 --> 01:49:30,980
that I could be here at all
to sing for ya.

1508
01:49:31,106 --> 01:49:34,609
I heard on the radio
this cutest little boy, nine years old...

1509
01:49:34,735 --> 01:49:36,861
and you know how
a deejay'll play a tune...

1510
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:39,614
and ask everybody
to phone in how they like it?

1511
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:43,952
I was listenin' to it,
and they asked for callers to call in.

1512
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:47,330
This little nine-year-old called in.
The song had voices in the background...

1513
01:49:47,498 --> 01:49:50,583
like the way they use
backup voices these days...

1514
01:49:50,709 --> 01:49:52,669
soundin' like little munchkins?

1515
01:49:52,795 --> 01:49:55,338
The deejay said,
"How old are you, son?"

1516
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:58,633
The boy said, "I'm nine,
and I think it's gonna be a hit."

1517
01:49:58,759 --> 01:50:03,054
The deejay said, "Why?"
"Because it had those chipmunks in it."

1518
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:07,225
And I thought that was so cute
because I can sing
like a munchkin myself...

1519
01:50:07,351 --> 01:50:09,727
and I'm real fond
of The Wizard of Oz.

1520
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:12,730
Plus, I live, you know,
just a ways out here...

1521
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:15,984
off of Interstate 24
on the road to Chattanooga...

1522
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:19,320
so you can see
why I kinda related to that.

1523
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:23,241
I think me and the boys are gonna
strike up another tune. Let's go, boys.

1524
01:50:23,367 --> 01:50:25,201
Three, four, one, two.

1525
01:50:29,206 --> 01:50:31,708
I think there's a storm.

1526
01:50:31,834 --> 01:50:34,627
Seems like it's a-brewin'.

1527
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:37,463
That's what my granddaddy
used to say all the time...

1528
01:50:40,718 --> 01:50:42,677
Once he got deaf...

1529
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:45,346
he never talked much no more.

1530
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,390
Except sometimes
he'd say, "Oh, gosh"...

1531
01:50:47,558 --> 01:50:50,184
or "Oh, durn it" or "My word."

1532
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:53,980
My granny, she'd go around
clickin' her teeth to the radio all day.

1533
01:50:54,106 --> 01:50:56,649
Boy, was she a lot of fun,
and cooked always...

1534
01:50:56,775 --> 01:50:59,861
my favorite, roast beef,
and she was a sweetheart.

1535
01:50:59,987 --> 01:51:03,323
She raised chickens too.
She, uh...

1536
01:51:03,449 --> 01:51:05,575
In fact, did you ever hear
a chicken sound?

1537
01:51:05,743 --> 01:51:08,870
You know how chickens go?

1538
01:51:10,247 --> 01:51:12,915
Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.
Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.

1539
01:51:13,042 --> 01:51:17,211
Anyway, I guess we'd better strike up
this tune before it's too late.

1540
01:51:17,338 --> 01:51:19,213
- Okay, boys.
- Three, four, one, two.

1541
01:51:31,769 --> 01:51:33,811
I ever really got
was when Mama...

1542
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:37,732
My grandma... she's the one who
clacked her false teeth to the radio.

1543
01:51:37,858 --> 01:51:41,110
She taught my mama how to sing,
and Mama taught me.

1544
01:51:41,278 --> 01:51:44,697
One time she took me, 'cause
we was gonna get a new Frigidaire.

1545
01:51:44,823 --> 01:51:47,867
She took me to the Frigidaire store
where the man was advertisin'.

1546
01:51:47,993 --> 01:51:49,911
This record was goin' 'round...

1547
01:51:50,037 --> 01:51:52,080
and my mama told him
I knew how to sing.

1548
01:51:52,206 --> 01:51:56,834
He said, "If she learns this tune,
I'll give y'all a quarter."

1549
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,921
So Mama and I went home...

1550
01:52:00,047 --> 01:52:02,840
And then what happened?
Let's see, I think... Uh, yeah.

1551
01:52:02,966 --> 01:52:04,717
We went home...

1552
01:52:04,843 --> 01:52:07,762
and I learned both sides
of the record in half an hour.

1553
01:52:07,888 --> 01:52:11,682
We went back and pranced in real fancy
and told him I'd learned 'em...

1554
01:52:11,809 --> 01:52:13,768
and he said, "Let me hear"...

1555
01:52:13,894 --> 01:52:16,687
so I sang him both sides
of the record instead of one.

1556
01:52:16,814 --> 01:52:20,733
So he gave us 50 cents, and we went
across the street and had us a soda.

1557
01:52:20,859 --> 01:52:23,236
Ever since then,
I been workin'. I don't...

1558
01:52:23,362 --> 01:52:26,656
I think ever since then
I been workin' and doin' my...

1559
01:52:26,782 --> 01:52:29,325
- Come on, come on.
- Supportin' myself.

1560
01:52:29,493 --> 01:52:31,411
- Anyway...
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

1561
01:52:31,537 --> 01:52:33,913
- Am I all right?
- I'm gonna get you some lemonade.

1562
01:52:34,039 --> 01:52:36,082
- Am I all right?
- You're fine. It's the microphone.

1563
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:37,417
- I ain't done.
- I know.

1564
01:52:37,543 --> 01:52:39,836
- I ain't done.
- Go get some... glass of water.

1565
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:42,713
Boys, help her off.
You'll come back. Okay, darlin'?

1566
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:45,299
Thank you!

1567
01:52:45,426 --> 01:52:47,343
All right. Watch the wire.

1568
01:52:47,469 --> 01:52:49,679
All right. Okay.

1569
01:52:49,805 --> 01:52:53,099
Aw, come on.
Have a heart, now.

1570
01:52:53,225 --> 01:52:56,310
Thank you!

1571
01:52:56,437 --> 01:52:59,939
Come on, now.
It's just too soon.

1572
01:53:00,065 --> 01:53:02,191
All of you must know...
Come on.

1573
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:06,154
You didn't mean that, did you?
That little girl's just come
out of the hospital.

1574
01:53:08,657 --> 01:53:12,076
You know that girl
just come out of the hospital.

1575
01:53:17,541 --> 01:53:20,168
I'm sorry. That little girl's
in there cryin' her eyes out...

1576
01:53:20,294 --> 01:53:22,837
'cause she didn't want
to disappoint you.

1577
01:53:31,138 --> 01:53:33,890
Y'all show up at Centennial Park
tomorrow at the Parthenon.

1578
01:53:34,057 --> 01:53:36,517
You'll see her for free
as our guests. How's that?

1579
01:53:39,104 --> 01:53:41,731
All right?
Okay, let's hear a welcome.

1580
01:53:41,899 --> 01:53:44,734
A get-well welcome for Barbara Jean.
Let's hear it. Come on!

1581
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:53,910
Ingrates.
All they are is ingrates.

1582
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:58,372
I got trapped out there,
and you guys know it.

1583
01:53:58,499 --> 01:54:00,875
- I want some ground rules right now.
- You name it.

1584
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:02,543
- She's gonna sing first, right?
- Right.

1585
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:05,046
She's gonna be off
before that man even shows.

1586
01:54:05,172 --> 01:54:07,131
Fine. Whatever you want.

1587
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:10,259
- Never should've brought her here.
- Any way you want it.

1588
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:13,513
No paraphernalia, no literature
being circulated. You understand?

1589
01:54:13,639 --> 01:54:17,725
And never, at any time, is she to be
associated with Hal Phillip Walker.

1590
01:54:17,851 --> 01:54:19,769
- Hello?
- Hey.

1591
01:54:19,937 --> 01:54:22,271
Guess who.

1592
01:54:22,397 --> 01:54:24,649
- Linnea?
- Yes, it's me.

1593
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:27,276
Hi. This is Tom.

1594
01:54:31,865 --> 01:54:35,868
Listen, I'm playing a gig tonight downtown.
You want to come and meet me?

1595
01:54:37,746 --> 01:54:40,122
It's at a place called the, uh...

1596
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,124
No Exit, or the Exit...

1597
01:54:42,292 --> 01:54:44,377
Exit Out, or somethin'.

1598
01:54:44,503 --> 01:54:47,630
Anyhow, it's right across the street
from Friday's, on Church Street.

1599
01:54:47,756 --> 01:54:49,632
You know where that is,
don't you?

1600
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,969
Anyhow, I'll be there
at 8:00, and, uh...

1601
01:54:53,095 --> 01:54:55,137
why don't you
meet me there?

1602
01:54:56,515 --> 01:54:58,432
- Okay?
- Um...

1603
01:55:09,486 --> 01:55:13,072
Driver, could I have
a wee bit more champagne?

1604
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:15,199
- It's Norman.
- Oh.

1605
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:17,952
Norman, yes.
Norman. Of course.

1606
01:55:18,078 --> 01:55:20,371
He doesn't like
to be known as a driver.

1607
01:55:20,497 --> 01:55:22,832
Oh. Thank you so much,
Norman.

1608
01:55:43,186 --> 01:55:45,730
- Have you ever been
to the ladies' restroom here?
- No.

1609
01:55:45,856 --> 01:55:49,442
I'm stuck here at the Exit/In
with no place left to go.

1610
01:56:01,163 --> 01:56:03,289
- I'll have a cider.
- Apple cider?

1611
01:56:03,415 --> 01:56:05,374
- Yes. Thank you.
- Put it on my bill.

1612
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,793
- On another bill?
- Yeah.

1613
01:56:07,919 --> 01:56:11,172
Uh, all right. And would you
put it in a wine glass, please?

1614
01:56:11,298 --> 01:56:14,175
Put it in a wine glass
and put it on my bill.

1615
01:56:14,301 --> 01:56:17,720
Traveling
in cozy, close quarters...

1616
01:56:17,846 --> 01:56:21,265
I mean, you sort of
have to camp in one room.

1617
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:24,727
- Well, Mary and I camp in one room.
- Obviously, yes...

1618
01:56:24,895 --> 01:56:27,855
- Tom camps in a lot of rooms.
- I shouldn't...

1619
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:30,399
My name's Wade Coolidge.
What's yours?

1620
01:56:31,735 --> 01:56:33,402
Um, Linnea is my name.

1621
01:56:33,528 --> 01:56:37,198
Well, shall I say
that Tom and I, um...

1622
01:56:39,201 --> 01:56:41,243
- You sang together?
- No, I mean...

1623
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:44,997
we sort of got to know
each other, um...

1624
01:56:45,123 --> 01:56:48,250
in the biblical sense,
shall we say.

1625
01:56:48,377 --> 01:56:50,753
- You went to church?
- I'm sorry.

1626
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:52,838
No, I'm sorry.
This is dreadful.

1627
01:56:52,964 --> 01:56:55,591
But he is so attractive,
I was wondering...

1628
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:58,803
I shouldn't be asking you.
I should really be asking Mary.

1629
01:56:58,929 --> 01:57:00,888
You went to bed
with him, right?

1630
01:57:02,057 --> 01:57:05,184
Oh, yeah.
I thought you understood that.

1631
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:07,269
Well, I shouldn't...

1632
01:57:07,396 --> 01:57:09,063
Where did you go
to bed with him?

1633
01:57:16,697 --> 01:57:19,031
Listen, we got
a special treat tonight.

1634
01:57:19,157 --> 01:57:21,742
A friend of mine
is in town cuttin' an album.

1635
01:57:21,868 --> 01:57:23,577
- That's you.
- Tom Frank is in the audience.

1636
01:57:23,704 --> 01:57:26,914
Tom? Speak of the devil!

1637
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,667
He's agreed to come up
and do a couple of numbers.

1638
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:32,461
Let's make him feel at home.
Tom Frank!

1639
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:34,130
Come on!

1640
01:57:34,297 --> 01:57:37,883
Right.

1641
01:57:39,511 --> 01:57:42,513
Goddamn it!

1642
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:46,934
- I haven't seen him for more than two minutes in three days.
-  - Thank you.

1643
01:57:49,563 --> 01:57:53,190
- As y'all may remember,
I used to be part of a trio.
- "Used to be"?

1644
01:57:53,316 --> 01:57:55,985
I been hidin' from 'em all week,
but they found me tonight...

1645
01:57:56,111 --> 01:57:58,487
so we might as well have
them up here too.

1646
01:57:58,613 --> 01:58:02,032
- Bill and Mary.
- Lovely!

1647
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:04,118
Yes, you must!

1648
01:58:10,208 --> 01:58:12,168
I've been watching it all week.

1649
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:15,963
Thank you, thank you.

1650
01:58:26,767 --> 01:58:29,894
We don't need to sing at all.
You guys can do it for us.

1651
02:00:23,967 --> 02:00:25,342
Mm!

1652
02:00:47,407 --> 02:00:51,160
When this is all over, I'm gonna
be taking them back to someplace...

1653
02:00:51,328 --> 02:00:53,329
and we could drive around.

1654
02:00:53,455 --> 02:00:55,915
I can show you
a little bit of Nashville...

1655
02:00:56,041 --> 02:00:59,668
and I can tell you things
that'd send you around the corner.

1656
02:00:59,794 --> 02:01:02,004
I'm not kidding.
I know, for instance...

1657
02:01:02,172 --> 02:01:05,674
- Uh... What is your name?
- Norman.

1658
02:01:05,842 --> 02:01:08,928
Yeah, Norman.
Please, Norman, I...

1659
02:01:09,054 --> 02:01:11,388
I make a point never
to gossip with servants.

1660
02:01:11,514 --> 02:01:14,016
Thank you.

1661
02:01:16,019 --> 02:01:17,728
Okay, fellas,
I think you know...

1662
02:01:17,854 --> 02:01:19,730
we've got a good man
to get behind.

1663
02:01:19,856 --> 02:01:24,068
I don't wanna take a lot of your time,
'cause we do have
entertainment for ya.

1664
02:01:24,194 --> 02:01:27,404
Uh, you got pledge cards
on the table there.

1665
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:30,032
You can pledge
anything you want to.

1666
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:33,035
I'll make sure... I'll make you pay,
whatever you put down there.

1667
02:01:33,203 --> 02:01:35,871
If you got a check,
don't be afraid to write it.

1668
02:01:35,997 --> 02:01:38,707
I'll get that to the bank quick,
before you can stop it.

1669
02:01:38,833 --> 02:01:41,877
Any cash, anything at all.

1670
02:01:42,003 --> 02:01:44,380
Don't anybody
be humble or shy.

1671
02:01:44,547 --> 02:01:48,676
That's all. And while you're writin',
so you don't get bored or anything...

1672
02:01:51,471 --> 02:01:55,015
Just keep your eyes up,
'cause good things come from above.

1673
02:02:15,412 --> 02:02:19,081
- Hi, y'all.
- Hi!

1674
02:02:20,417 --> 02:02:22,042
My name's Sueleen Gay...

1675
02:02:22,168 --> 02:02:25,921
and I'm here to sing you a song
about a girl that never gets enough.

1676
02:02:52,699 --> 02:02:54,742
She's the worst singer
I ever heard.

1677
02:02:57,787 --> 02:03:00,164
She cannot sing a lick,
can she?

1678
02:03:13,178 --> 02:03:15,345
Hey, you forgot your jacket.

1679
02:03:24,564 --> 02:03:27,441
Excuse me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1680
02:03:29,194 --> 02:03:32,029
If you want more,
it's gonna have to be me alone...

1681
02:03:32,197 --> 02:03:34,573
'cause it seems
I just been deserted.

1682
02:03:34,699 --> 02:03:37,701
I'm gonna play
somethin' that, uh...

1683
02:03:37,827 --> 02:03:40,496
I wrote just recently...

1684
02:03:40,622 --> 02:03:43,624
- and came here to record.
- All right!

1685
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:46,877
I'm gonna dedicate this to someone
special who might be here tonight.

1686
02:03:49,547 --> 02:03:51,507
This is a song called
"I'm Easy."

1687
02:06:57,735 --> 02:06:59,319
Do it to me.

1688
02:07:01,447 --> 02:07:03,532
- Hi.
- Hi!

1689
02:07:03,658 --> 02:07:07,327
I'm gonna sing you all
a song Barbara Jean wrote.

1690
02:07:10,665 --> 02:07:12,708
Just wanna get comfortable.

1691
02:07:18,715 --> 02:07:21,800
It's called, uh,
"One, I Love You."

1692
02:07:56,127 --> 02:07:58,754
Boo! Come on, now!

1693
02:08:10,808 --> 02:08:13,101
Boo! Come on! Take it off!

1694
02:08:24,822 --> 02:08:29,117
- Did you tell Trout what you wanted?
- Did I? It was your job.

1695
02:08:29,243 --> 02:08:31,328
- I know.
- I assumed he knew what...

1696
02:08:31,454 --> 02:08:34,122
Well, I didn't think
it was gonna be any problem.

1697
02:08:56,604 --> 02:08:59,106
Come on! What is this?

1698
02:08:59,232 --> 02:09:01,316
Come on back here, baby!

1699
02:09:04,779 --> 02:09:07,489
- What's the matter, honey?
- I don't understand what's goin' on.

1700
02:09:07,615 --> 02:09:10,075
Didn't Trout tell you
you're supposed to strip?

1701
02:09:10,201 --> 02:09:13,703
I'm a singer!

1702
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:17,332
Listen, go finish the show
like you told Trout you'd do...

1703
02:09:17,458 --> 02:09:20,085
and I'll set it up
so you can sing in the Parthenon.

1704
02:09:20,211 --> 02:09:24,506
- Huh?
- I'll set it up for you so you can sing
in the Parthenon with Barbara Jean.

1705
02:09:24,632 --> 02:09:28,260
- Go finish the show...
- I'm gonna get to sing with Barbara Jean?

1706
02:09:28,386 --> 02:09:31,680
Yes, you are. Yes, you will.
I'll take care of it.

1707
02:09:31,806 --> 02:09:35,767
Go finish the show
like you told Trout you'd do, okay?

1708
02:09:35,893 --> 02:09:39,104
These fellas really like you, honey.

1709
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:42,732
- Okay?
- I'm gonna be as big a star
as Barbara Jean is one day.

1710
02:09:42,859 --> 02:09:44,484
I know you are.
You can't miss.

1711
02:09:44,610 --> 02:09:48,947
- Go on, now.
- Come on, let's have the show!

1712
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:15,891
Whoo! Hey!
All right! All right!

1713
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:43,627
You're my mama!

1714
02:10:54,472 --> 02:10:56,014
All right!

1715
02:11:11,989 --> 02:11:15,617
Whoo! Hey, hey, hey!

1716
02:11:56,284 --> 02:11:59,244
Want to learn how to say
something in sign language?

1717
02:12:01,289 --> 02:12:03,832
Yeah.
How do you say "I love you"?

1718
02:12:03,958 --> 02:12:07,335
Well, you could say...
Shorthand for it is...

1719
02:12:07,461 --> 02:12:09,170
This is shorthand.

1720
02:12:12,341 --> 02:12:14,426
Or you could say, "I"...

1721
02:12:14,552 --> 02:12:17,012
you could say, "love you."

1722
02:12:17,138 --> 02:12:19,306
- "I love you"?
- Mm-hmm.

1723
02:12:19,432 --> 02:12:23,059
Or you could just say,
"I'm happy I met you."

1724
02:12:23,227 --> 02:12:25,812
- I'm happy I met you.
- Right.

1725
02:12:30,276 --> 02:12:32,152
Phew.

1726
02:12:32,278 --> 02:12:35,572
How can you smoke
those things?

1727
02:12:35,740 --> 02:12:38,116
It's easy.

1728
02:12:41,787 --> 02:12:43,580
- Do you smoke?
- No.

1729
02:12:43,706 --> 02:12:45,582
What do you wanna
do that for?

1730
02:12:53,966 --> 02:12:55,592
- Doesn't look good.
- No?

1731
02:12:55,718 --> 02:12:57,719
- Hm-mmm.
- So what?

1732
02:13:05,353 --> 02:13:08,396
- Tom, I have to go.
- Aw.

1733
02:13:13,110 --> 02:13:16,946
- Can't you just call him,
tell him you're hung up?
- No, I can't.

1734
02:13:19,450 --> 02:13:22,077
- Couldn't you just stay another hour?
- No, no.

1735
02:13:28,584 --> 02:13:30,335
I just can't.

1736
02:13:55,194 --> 02:13:58,613
Long-distance operator.
You want this charged to your room?

1737
02:13:58,739 --> 02:14:00,615
- Yeah, please.
- Your room number, please?

1738
02:14:00,741 --> 02:14:03,243
One-twelve.

1739
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:08,498
- Hello?
- Hey.

1740
02:14:10,251 --> 02:14:12,794
- How you doin'?
- Oh, wow.

1741
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:15,839
Listen, I'm real sorry
I left the way I did.

1742
02:14:15,965 --> 02:14:17,841
Oh, wow.

1743
02:14:18,008 --> 02:14:21,344
It's really nice to talk to you.
It's okay.

1744
02:14:21,512 --> 02:14:23,430
It's nice to talk to you too.

1745
02:14:23,556 --> 02:14:26,307
- What are you doing?
- I'm thinkin' about you.

1746
02:14:26,434 --> 02:14:29,269
You are? Wow.

1747
02:14:29,395 --> 02:14:31,229
Can you come down here?

1748
02:14:31,355 --> 02:14:33,481
- When?
- Tonight.

1749
02:14:33,607 --> 02:14:36,651
- Oh, Tom, I can't do that.
- Why not?

1750
02:14:36,777 --> 02:14:40,530
We have an opening at the museum
tomorrow. I can't leave my job like that.

1751
02:14:40,656 --> 02:14:43,199
Why don't you quit?
I'm makin' bread here.

1752
02:14:43,325 --> 02:14:45,869
We've tried that before.
It doesn't work.

1753
02:14:45,995 --> 02:14:47,829
I need to be busy.

1754
02:14:47,955 --> 02:14:50,540
I'll wait for you here.
When are you coming back?

1755
02:14:50,666 --> 02:14:52,208
About a week.

1756
02:14:52,376 --> 02:14:55,044
Okay, well, just come on back.

1757
02:14:55,212 --> 02:14:57,547
Move back in. It's fine.

1758
02:14:57,673 --> 02:14:59,549
I miss you.

1759
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:02,802
I really do.

1760
02:15:02,928 --> 02:15:05,513
New York's really been nice.
It's missed you too.

1761
02:15:05,639 --> 02:15:07,599
The weather's been terrific.

1762
02:15:07,725 --> 02:15:10,602
I went sailing.

1763
02:15:10,728 --> 02:15:12,479
- Yeah.
- What's that?

1764
02:15:12,605 --> 02:15:14,522
That's just room service.

1765
02:15:14,648 --> 02:15:17,400
There's 50 cents on the desk there.
Just pick it up.

1766
02:15:17,526 --> 02:15:20,403
- Big tipper.
- Yeah, well, times are hard.

1767
02:15:20,529 --> 02:15:21,946
Right, all that money.

1768
02:15:22,072 --> 02:15:24,991
You can afford to bring me
down there, I see. Hmm.

1769
02:15:25,117 --> 02:15:28,912
- Yeah. Well, never mind.
See you in a week.
- I love you, Tom.

1770
02:15:41,842 --> 02:15:43,301
This it, honey?

1771
02:15:44,386 --> 02:15:46,012
Be careful gettin' out.

1772
02:16:12,331 --> 02:16:14,040
Hey.

1773
02:16:15,125 --> 02:16:16,960
Hey!
Hey, wait just a minute.

1774
02:16:17,127 --> 02:16:18,878
Just hold it, will ya?

1775
02:16:21,257 --> 02:16:23,633
Now...

1776
02:16:23,801 --> 02:16:26,553
I know you don't do that
all the time. I...

1777
02:16:30,808 --> 02:16:33,601
I want to tell you
that I just... I mean...

1778
02:16:35,437 --> 02:16:37,397
Me personally, boy, I...

1779
02:16:37,523 --> 02:16:40,400
I'd just like to kiss you all over,
every place.

1780
02:16:40,526 --> 02:16:42,402
You know what I'm telling you?

1781
02:16:42,528 --> 02:16:44,988
- I think you...
- Sueleen?

1782
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:49,158
You okay?

1783
02:16:51,328 --> 02:16:52,912
Shit, man.

1784
02:16:59,378 --> 02:17:02,005
Didn't your mama
teach you no manners?

1785
02:17:02,131 --> 02:17:04,507
Who was that?

1786
02:17:07,219 --> 02:17:10,138
What's the matter with you?
Ain't you gonna talk to me?

1787
02:17:13,684 --> 02:17:15,476
Did it go all right?

1788
02:17:16,770 --> 02:17:18,354
- Oh, Wade.
- What?

1789
02:17:18,522 --> 02:17:21,858
I had to do me a striptease tonight
in front of all those men...

1790
02:17:22,026 --> 02:17:24,861
to get to sing at the Parthenon
with Barbara Jean.

1791
02:17:25,029 --> 02:17:26,988
Oh, shit! Sueleen, I...

1792
02:17:27,114 --> 02:17:29,699
That's dreadful!
That's terrible, girl!

1793
02:17:29,867 --> 02:17:31,409
I mean...

1794
02:17:31,535 --> 02:17:35,163
I been meanin'
to tell you this for a long time:

1795
02:17:35,289 --> 02:17:36,831
You can't sing.

1796
02:17:36,957 --> 02:17:39,459
You may as well face the fact
you cannot sing.

1797
02:17:39,585 --> 02:17:43,421
You ain't gonna never be no star.
I wish you'd give it up.

1798
02:17:43,547 --> 02:17:46,674
They gonna kill ya. They gonna tear
your heart out if you keep on.

1799
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:48,843
They gonna walk
on your soul, girl.

1800
02:17:49,887 --> 02:17:52,680
- I don't know
what you're talkin' about.
- You can't sing.

1801
02:17:52,806 --> 02:17:55,224
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah? You wanna make a bet?

1802
02:17:55,351 --> 02:17:58,561
You wanna come to the Parthenon
and watch me sing with Barbara Jean?

1803
02:17:58,687 --> 02:18:02,440
- I am leavin' for Detroit Wednesday.
- You just come and watch.

1804
02:18:02,566 --> 02:18:05,526
I'm leavin' for Detroit,
and if you wanna go, come on.

1805
02:18:05,653 --> 02:18:08,112
- They gonna kill you in this town!
- You come and see.

1806
02:18:08,238 --> 02:18:11,741
- They gonna use you. You know that.
- Bye, Wade.

1807
02:18:11,909 --> 02:18:14,494
Dumb bitch!
I don't know why I stick around.

1808
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:16,871
She makes me
so goddamn mad I could spit!

1809
02:18:16,997 --> 02:18:20,583
Little more than a year ago,
a man named Hal Phillip Walker...

1810
02:18:20,709 --> 02:18:23,753
excited a group of college students
with some questions:

1811
02:18:23,921 --> 02:18:26,089
Have you stood
on a high and windy hill...

1812
02:18:26,256 --> 02:18:28,925
and heard the acorns
drop and roll?

1813
02:18:29,051 --> 02:18:31,386
Have you walked in the valley
beside the brook...

1814
02:18:31,512 --> 02:18:33,721
walked alone
and remembered?

1815
02:18:33,847 --> 02:18:37,016
Does Christmas
smell like oranges to you?

1816
02:18:37,142 --> 02:18:40,269
In a commencement speech,
such questions were fitting, perhaps...

1817
02:18:40,396 --> 02:18:43,648
but hardly the material with which
to launch a presidential campaign.

1818
02:18:43,774 --> 02:18:46,275
Even those who pay
close attention to politics...

1819
02:18:46,402 --> 02:18:48,653
probably saw
Hal Phillip Walker...

1820
02:18:48,779 --> 02:18:50,655
and his Replacement Party...

1821
02:18:50,781 --> 02:18:52,740
as a bit of frost on the hillside.

1822
02:18:52,866 --> 02:18:56,452
Summer, if not late spring,
would surely do away with all that.

1823
02:18:56,620 --> 02:19:00,123
Well, now that summer,
along with presidential primaries,
is heavy upon us...

1824
02:19:00,249 --> 02:19:03,626
and the frost is still there,
perhaps we should take a closer look.

1825
02:19:03,752 --> 02:19:06,963
Hal Phillip Walker is,
in a way, a mystery man.

1826
02:19:07,089 --> 02:19:11,092
Out of nowhere, with a handful
of students and scarcely any pros...

1827
02:19:11,218 --> 02:19:14,220
he's managed to win
three presidential primaries...

1828
02:19:14,346 --> 02:19:17,765
and is given a fighting chance
to take a fourth: Tennessee.

1829
02:19:17,891 --> 02:19:20,601
A win in that state would
take on added significance...

1830
02:19:20,728 --> 02:19:23,271
for only once
in the last 50 years...

1831
02:19:23,397 --> 02:19:26,983
has Tennessee failed to vote
for the winning presidential candidate.

1832
02:19:27,151 --> 02:19:29,986
No doubt many Americans,
especially party-liners...

1833
02:19:30,154 --> 02:19:32,572
wish that Hal Phillip Walker
would go away...

1834
02:19:32,698 --> 02:19:34,574
disappear
like the natural frost...

1835
02:19:34,700 --> 02:19:37,577
and come again
at some more convenient season.

1836
02:19:37,703 --> 02:19:40,329
But wherever he may be going,
it seems sure...

1837
02:19:40,497 --> 02:19:43,416
that Hal Phillip Walker
is not going away...

1838
02:19:43,542 --> 02:19:45,501
for there is genuine appeal...

1839
02:19:45,669 --> 02:19:48,504
and it must be related
to the raw courage of this man...

1840
02:19:48,672 --> 02:19:52,550
running for president,
willing to battle vast oil companies...

1841
02:19:52,676 --> 02:19:55,094
eliminate subsidies to farmers...

1842
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:58,347
tax churches,
abolish the electoral college...

1843
02:19:58,515 --> 02:20:00,433
change the national anthem...

1844
02:20:00,559 --> 02:20:04,020
and remove lawyers from government,
especially from Congress.

1845
02:20:04,188 --> 02:20:07,106
At this point, it would be wise
to say most of us...

1846
02:20:07,232 --> 02:20:10,068
don't know the answer
to Hal Phillip Walker.

1847
02:20:10,194 --> 02:20:12,236
But to answer
one of his questions...

1848
02:20:12,362 --> 02:20:14,947
as a matter of fact,
Christmas has always smelled...

1849
02:20:15,074 --> 02:20:17,366
like oranges to me.

1850
02:21:28,856 --> 02:21:31,941
You may have
to sit out here an hour or so.

1851
02:21:32,067 --> 02:21:34,861
All right. It'll give me time
to work on my speech.

1852
02:21:34,987 --> 02:21:36,362
Okay, thank you.

1853
02:21:36,488 --> 02:21:38,739
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

1854
02:21:38,866 --> 02:21:40,908
How are you?
Good to see you.

1855
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:47,915
- Delbert. How are you?
- Hey, John. How are you?

1856
02:21:48,041 --> 02:21:50,376
- Can I say hello?
- He's working on his speech.

1857
02:21:50,502 --> 02:21:52,670
- We'll do that later.
- Right.

1858
02:21:52,796 --> 02:21:56,632
- He's gonna wait back there, huh?
- He'll sit out there a minute.

1859
02:21:56,758 --> 02:21:59,218
- Anybody here yet?
- Yeah, some of the people.

1860
02:21:59,344 --> 02:22:03,055
- Barnett?
- I haven't seen him yet,
but he ought to be here quick.

1861
02:22:03,182 --> 02:22:05,516
This building
was originally here...

1862
02:22:05,642 --> 02:22:08,186
It was made out of lumber
and plaster of Paris.

1863
02:22:08,312 --> 02:22:10,813
- Oh, yeah?
- This whole big building.

1864
02:22:10,939 --> 02:22:14,150
See, they built it
for a centennial celebration...

1865
02:22:14,318 --> 02:22:17,069
and people liked this,
and they didn't want it torn down.

1866
02:22:17,196 --> 02:22:19,488
Nashville got to be called
"Athens of the South."

1867
02:22:19,615 --> 02:22:22,700
- They sort of took to that.
- Because of this building?

1868
02:22:22,826 --> 02:22:24,702
- Yeah, right.
- That's good!

1869
02:22:24,828 --> 02:22:27,747
Then they had to rebuild it.
This one was originally just...

1870
02:22:27,873 --> 02:22:30,583
this was built back up
right before I was born.

1871
02:22:30,709 --> 02:22:32,793
Whoo!
Gonna be a scorcher.

1872
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:36,380
- Will the park police control all this?
- Right.

1873
02:22:36,506 --> 02:22:38,925
What's all these chairs?
Hey, Triple, Delbert, come on.

1874
02:22:39,051 --> 02:22:41,010
We don't need all these chairs.

1875
02:22:41,136 --> 02:22:43,679
- This ain't no band here, right?
- What's the matter, man?

1876
02:22:43,847 --> 02:22:45,765
I don't...
I don't believe it!

1877
02:22:45,891 --> 02:22:47,683
What's the matter?

1878
02:22:47,809 --> 02:22:51,437
Are you guys jerkin' me around?
Do you see what I see, or am I...

1879
02:22:51,563 --> 02:22:54,565
What the hell is that sign
doin' up there, Triple?

1880
02:22:54,691 --> 02:22:56,817
We had some ground rules.
Am I right?

1881
02:22:56,944 --> 02:22:59,445
No political signs,
no advertisements, no noth...

1882
02:22:59,571 --> 02:23:03,449
- What the hell are you doin', huh?
Go about your business.
- We'll take care of it.

1883
02:23:03,575 --> 02:23:06,702
I have abided by all the ground rules
you laid down, Barnett.

1884
02:23:06,870 --> 02:23:09,497
I have Walker sitting out
behind this place like an idiot!

1885
02:23:09,623 --> 02:23:13,000
Well, he can sit out in the sun
and parch for all I care!

1886
02:23:13,126 --> 02:23:16,712
My wife ain't well! I brought her
out of a hospital bed to be here!

1887
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:20,174
You gave me some truth!
You're full of it, just like your man!

1888
02:23:20,300 --> 02:23:23,552
- I have abided by every ground rule.
- Except what?

1889
02:23:23,679 --> 02:23:27,139
What is that up there?
She ain't gonna appear here
with that sign up there!

1890
02:23:27,266 --> 02:23:30,393
- I have busted my ass for you!
- I'm gonna bust your ass too!

1891
02:23:30,519 --> 02:23:33,437
I'm through with it!
Take your wife and take a walk!

1892
02:23:33,563 --> 02:23:37,024
I'll tell these people
she's not going to appear again!

1893
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:40,695
- Go on and do it!
- Okay, take a walk, and I'll do it.

1894
02:23:40,821 --> 02:23:44,198
You'd do that, huh? You'd put
a knife in my wife's back like that?

1895
02:23:44,324 --> 02:23:47,952
You're putting the knife
in her back, buster. You're doing it.

1896
02:23:48,078 --> 02:23:51,956
I have not got time
to take the goddamn sign down
and put it back up again!

1897
02:23:52,082 --> 02:23:55,209
What are you hollerin' about?
You tryin' to embarrass me?

1898
02:23:55,335 --> 02:23:59,255
- I'm tryin' to be heard.
- Get these chairs off, and we'll talk about it.

1899
02:23:59,423 --> 02:24:02,633
- Okay. I'll take care of it.
- Chrissake! Delbert... where is that rat?

1900
02:24:02,759 --> 02:24:05,219
What are you hiding for,
you little rat?

1901
02:24:06,388 --> 02:24:09,390
And grant us
so to serve thee by day...

1902
02:24:09,516 --> 02:24:12,393
that we may find
eternal fellowship with them...

1903
02:24:12,519 --> 02:24:15,604
through him who died
and rose again for us all...

1904
02:24:15,772 --> 02:24:18,065
Jesus Christ, our Lord.

1905
02:24:18,191 --> 02:24:19,942
Amen.

1906
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:25,406
- Mr. Green, it's not over.
- I'm going to find Martha.

1907
02:24:25,532 --> 02:24:28,617
- What for?
- She owes some respect to Esther.

1908
02:24:28,785 --> 02:24:30,786
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

1909
02:24:30,954 --> 02:24:32,997
Barbara Jean
and Haven Hamilton.

1910
02:25:50,033 --> 02:25:51,951
I'll find her.

1911
02:26:58,143 --> 02:27:00,269
Thank you.

1912
02:29:50,732 --> 02:29:52,941
For Mama and Daddy.
Thank you.

1913
02:30:00,575 --> 02:30:03,702
Thank you so much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1914
02:30:03,828 --> 02:30:06,455
- Thank you.
- Wonderful! Wonderful!

1915
02:30:06,581 --> 02:30:08,999
Let's hear it for Barbara Jean!

1916
02:30:12,796 --> 02:30:15,714
Get that gun!

1917
02:30:17,717 --> 02:30:20,052
I'm all right. You get her.

1918
02:30:20,178 --> 02:30:23,222
- Dad?
- Bud, help her off. I'm all right.

1919
02:30:23,348 --> 02:30:26,475
- Get Walker out of here!
- Get Walker out of here!

1920
02:30:26,601 --> 02:30:29,311
- Get off your asses!
- Watch her head!

1921
02:30:29,437 --> 02:30:32,815
Y'all take it easy now.
This isn't Dallas, it's Nashville.

1922
02:30:32,941 --> 02:30:35,567
This is Nashville.
You show 'em what we're made of.

1923
02:30:35,694 --> 02:30:37,903
They can't do this to us
here in Nashville.

1924
02:30:38,029 --> 02:30:40,781
Okay, everybody, sing!

1925
02:30:40,907 --> 02:30:42,783
Come on, somebody, sing!

1926
02:30:42,909 --> 02:30:45,619
No, I'm fine. You sing.
You stay here and play.

1927
02:30:48,498 --> 02:30:50,708
- Somebody sing.
- You've been hurt.

1928
02:30:50,834 --> 02:30:53,335
- I'm gonna get somebody to help you.
- Somebody sing. Sing.

1929
02:30:53,461 --> 02:30:54,837
Sing!

1930
02:30:54,963 --> 02:30:57,256
I think you've been hurt.

1931
02:30:57,382 --> 02:31:00,759
Watch your step there.
Watch your step there.

1932
02:31:03,930 --> 02:31:06,890
- Come on, easy, easy.
- I can't stop that blood, man!

1933
02:31:07,016 --> 02:31:09,476
Excuse me.
Have you got a car or somethin'?

1934
02:31:25,702 --> 02:31:27,494
Can you please tell me
what's happened?

1935
02:34:00,231 --> 02:34:04,109
except Clorox bottles
and plastic flyswatters...

1936
02:34:23,046 --> 02:34:24,296
Come on, everybody!

1937
02:35:09,801 --> 02:35:12,094
Ain't gonna be nothin'
left in our graves...

1938
02:35:12,261 --> 02:35:15,764
except flyswatters
with red dots on 'em.

1939
02:37:48,751 --> 02:37:50,752
I ain't gonna be worried.
