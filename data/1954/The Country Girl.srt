1
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,476
Here's a coffee, Bernie.

2
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,476
Coffee, Mr Cook?

3
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,314
Let's discuss it. Don't pout as if
I'd just taken away your tricycle.

4
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,954
I'm not pouting. I just disagree.

5
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,596
But Frank Elgin?
Let the doorman read for the part!

6
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,395
Phil, we've been in rehearsal
for five days.

7
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,355
Our leading man was dreadful. Maybe
I was the wrong director for him.

8
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,838
We let him go yesterday.
We do not have a replacement.

9
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,396
We open in Boston on the 28th.
We are in trouble.

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,311
- I can do without the sarcasm.
- Let me audition him for you.

11
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,274
Phil, there's no harm
in giving the man a reading.

12
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,314
I agree with you, but when
I wanted to read Ray Watson,

13
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,479
that was a waste of time,
and he's a better actor than Elgin.

14
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,357
A lot of guys can act or sing better,
but nobody can do both as well.

15
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,552
- What about Billy Hertz?
- He's pompous.

16
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,320
This isn't <i>Student Prince</i>
or <i>Blossom Time</i>.

17
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,479
The guy has to act while he's singing
and sing while he's acting.

18
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,277
In <i>Lonesome Town</i>, Elgin played
a part like this. He was magnificent.

19
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,233
- Ask Henry. He played the piano.
- When?

20
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,876
- Eight years ago.
- He didn't fall off bar stools then.

21
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,039
- He hasn't had a drink in ages.
- To a drunk, ten minutes is ages.

22
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,199
- I just want you to listen to him!
- All right, go ahead!

23
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,072
Larry?

24
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,114
- As soon as Elgin comes in...
- He's here.

25
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,276
I didn't want to interrupt.

26
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,349
Send him in.
Now, Cookie, no cracks, please.

27
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,756
- What are you auditioning, owls?
- Hello, Frank. Bernie Dodd.

28
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,918
- How do you do?
- Our producer, Mr Cook.

29
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,557
- Hello. How are you?
- Paul Unger and Henry Johnson.

30
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,115
- Hey, Henry!
- It's been a long time.

31
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,757
I told him to write his own music.
You took my advice, huh?

32
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,916
- How's the family?
- Fine.

33
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,714
- Is your boy in high school?
- The Air Force.

34
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,115
- No!
- Yes, he is.

35
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,869
Let's get started.
I've got a luncheon date.

36
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,835
This is an offbeat show, a
dramatisation of <i>The Land Around Us</i>.

37
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,315
- You remember the book?
- Sure.

38
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,274
The boys have done
an exciting musical adaptation.

39
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,314
The music is part of the fabric,
woven in and out.

40
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,479
Keep the seats from getting dusty,
give them something different.

41
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,559
Yeah. Would you read
a couple of scenes for Mr Cook?

42
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,070
- There's one in the first act...
- Excuse me.

43
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,033
You were speaking of <i>Lonesome Town</i>.

44
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,677
Frank could do the Pitchman number.
That'd show Phil everything.

45
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,839
- All right.
- If I remember it. You sure you do?

46
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,318
I should. Eight performances a week
for a year and a half.

47
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,991
- Describe the number to Mr Cook.
- OK.

48
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,953
It wasn't much, really.

49
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,915
I played one of those pitchmen,
sort of a fanciful character.

50
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,671
Instead of selling a patent medicine,
I was selling a philosophy,

51
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,836
a sunshine salesman.

52
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,999
The scene was a New York
street corner, under a lamppost.

53
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,670
I had a... Is it OK
if I use this for a minute?

54
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,348
- Use anything you like.
- Thanks.

55
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,238
- When I made my entrance...
- OK, I get it. Get on with it.

56
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,598
I was carrying an imaginary valise,
one of those pitchman's outfits.

57
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,756
OK, Henry.

58
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,479
And then a crowd of sourpusses
began to gather round.

59
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,356
A left-handed Indian, this kid.

60
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,799
Friends, I have here in this valise

61
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,596
nostrums, cure-alls, panaceas,
unguents, oils and healing waters.

62
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,237
What did you say, son?
You say the valise is empty?

63
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,431
Son, this valise is loaded.

64
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,189
You're just looking at it,
and your windows are foggy.

65
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,358
What did you say?
You can't see nothing?

66
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,711
There's no trick in believing in
what you see.

67
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,037
The trick is believing in
what you can't see.

68
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,596
You've got to visualise
the indiscernible.

69
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,474
Every item in this valise belongs
to you as well as it does to me.

70
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,913
What's that you say, Officer?
Have I got a licence?

71
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,557
Just the greatest licence
in the world, poetic licence.

72
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,194
You been listening to my pitch?

73
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,836
We're going to the station house?

74
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,192
You got a desk sergeant
who's a little cantankerous?

75
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,834
Here's how we'll handle his case.

76
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,869
Share it among you, friends.
Tell them where you got it.

77
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,195
- You have a good beat for a writer.
- Fine, Frank.

78
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,359
You ought to hear it with
an orchestra. It's good and lousy.

79
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,838
- Wait outside for a second.
- I'm a little in the dark.

80
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,191
Is it a musical spot,
a small part or what?

81
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,349
It's the lead, Frank. The whole show
is built around this character.

82
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,593
Well, didn't it speak for itself?

83
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,759
He's probably been doing that
at dinner parties for ten years.

84
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,191
Did it prove he's worth
risking $200,000 on?

85
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,834
Did it prove he can carry a show?

86
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,999
Be sensible. That guy's been
in the pickle since you were a kid.

87
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,955
Someone took a chance with Laurette
Taylor in <i>The Glass Menagerie.</i>

88
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,109
Bernie, what are you trying to prove?
We've got a good book, good music.

89
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,757
Why can't you be satisfied
with a reliable, sober actor?

90
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,316
He'll give you
a reliable, sober performance.

91
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,080
That's not what people pay to see.

92
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,955
- You fought me over Danelli.
- I think you were wrong.

93
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,594
Instead of teaching an actor to box,

94
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,758
you teach a punch-drunk fighter
to act.

95
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,555
- He gave you a great performance.
- He gave us trouble, too.

96
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,514
If there was a fight at the Garden,
he wouldn't show up.

97
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,475
With Elgin, you'll get something
that happens once in 20 years.

98
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,955
I'll get it out of him.

99
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,915
- You're good, but not that good.
- People have always said that to me.

100
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,999
So now you're going to show them,
every one of them.

101
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,156
Directing doesn't satisfy you.

102
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,796
You want to take a corpse
and breathe life into it.

103
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,356
Maybe I'm crazy.
Doesn't this worry you guys?

104
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,509
- Not if it doesn't worry Bernie.
- He's too old for the part.

105
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,269
Hairpieces will make him look
ten years younger.

106
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,439
All right. Could we look for
someone else while he's rehearsing?

107
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,791
No, we don't let him go
without real cause,

108
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,753
a binge, or if he can't retain lines.

109
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,394
Give him a run-of-the-play contract.

110
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,593
- Wait a minute!
- I need his complete confidence.

111
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,557
No! I'll take a $40,000 loss before I
give him a run-of-the-play contract.

112
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,038
- OK, two weeks. Agreed, Paul? Henry?
- OK with me.

113
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,516
Frank? Frank Elgin?

114
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,871
- Elgin left.
- What do you mean?

115
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,469
- He left.
- Where? Coffee? What?

116
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,638
He just walked out. He didn't say.

117
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,274
Try the nearest bar.

118
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,759
- Mr Elgin in?
- No, he's not.

119
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,714
Mrs Elgin? I'd like to talk
to Frank. I'm Bernie Dodd.

120
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,195
I don't know when Frank will be back.

121
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,356
Mind if I wait?

122
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,671
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thanks.

123
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,829
- Did Frank say when he'd be back?
- He didn't say where he was going.

124
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,794
- Didn't he say he had an audition?
- No.

125
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,117
I looked around after it was over,
but he'd gone.

126
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,835
- Will he do?
- That all depends.

127
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,957
If you're wondering if you can get
Frank for very little money, you can.

128
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,119
It doesn't depend on that.
Does he still drink?

129
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,074
Just what did you think
I would answer to that?

130
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,032
- Touché.
- What?

131
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,597
- Touché. In French, that means...
- Everybody knows what it means.

132
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,439
You're even younger than I thought.

133
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,077
You try to look like an old lady.
You shouldn't do your hair like that.

134
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,434
Some women pay too much attention to
themselves and some don't pay enough.

135
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,189
That's quite a pearl of wisdom.
May I quote you?

136
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,199
- How long have you been married?
- Ten years.

137
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,834
- Did you meet in a show?
- Look, Mr Dodd...

138
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,589
- Were you ever an actress?
- Not me, thank you.

139
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,234
I'm just a girl from the country.

140
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,195
The theatre and its people have
always been a complete mystery to me.

141
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,550
They still are.

142
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,398
Dreiser, Balzac, Montaigne.
Who reads these books?

143
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,160
I do.

144
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,717
I'm afraid to ask if you enjoy them.
Montaigne's too polite for me.

145
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,914
- That doesn't surprise me.
- Frank's old recordings?

146
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,079
Some new. There's one on the machine
he did last week.

147
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,274
A man with his talent.
It's degrading.

148
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,436
So is not eating.

149
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,954
Why didn't you wait?

150
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,312
I figured the boat had sailed.
The producer didn't like me.

151
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,751
Since when does a producer
have to love an actor?

152
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,192
I can't go to battle unless
everybody is rooting for me.

153
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,551
- Cook thinks you're a drinker.
- Not on a show.

154
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,639
Not according to Maxwell.
You worked for him in '46.

155
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,391
After a couple of months,
he had to replace you.

156
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,070
While I was playing in that show,
our son died.

157
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,229
What about this show? I need an actor
who can stay sober and learn lines.

158
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,591
Are you that actor or not?
Make up your mind.

159
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,157
Give me time. Cook wasn't
the only reason I left the theatre.

160
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,798
I wouldn't take a part like this
without talking it over with Georgie.

161
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,994
- I'll be back in ten minutes.
- He's afraid of the responsibility.

162
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,919
But the gamble's all on my side!

163
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,671
It's not a question of being afraid
of the responsibility.

164
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,429
The part's the whole show.
You said so yourself.

165
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,598
You're opening in Boston the 28th.

166
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,430
I don't think I could learn
the lines. You need Walter Huston.

167
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,589
It's bad enough to go to Hollywood
to cast. You suggest I go to heaven?

168
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,190
- You can do it, Frank.
- Why are you so sure?

169
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,554
When I was a hat-check boy,
you, Lunt and Jolson were my heroes.

170
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,072
- I know everything you've done.
- You exaggerate to make your point.

171
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,431
- Are you for him or against him?
- I'm his wife.

172
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,394
I want honesty from both of you.
Flattery is cheap.

173
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,353
How about a little costly truth?

174
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,436
I'm not blind to Frank's condition.
This room tells me what he is.

175
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,589
I'm not one of those nice people
who buys you a drink and that's it.

176
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,237
I won't leave you on a limb. We'll
work together and worry together.

177
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,798
But if you do me dirt, just once,
no pity, not a drop of pity.

178
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,754
No pity. I like that.
Now he knows what to expect.

179
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,919
- What contract do you offer?
- Standard two-week contract.

180
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,510
- You could let Frank out any time?
- Exactly.

181
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,872
He won't have confidence with
a two-week clause. Would you?

182
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,595
I have nothing in my mind
except for Frank to play this part.

183
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,756
That's sentiment again.

184
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,512
I come here with the best intentions.
Suddenly I find I'm victimising you.

185
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,077
- Did I bring you a basket of snakes?
- It's not the two-weeks clause.

186
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,272
I don't want to bite off
more than I can chew.

187
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,476
We're in Boston for two weeks.
We can stay out until you're perfect.

188
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,639
- Would you do that?
- I'd insist on it.

189
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,789
Talk it over with your agent.
Call the office by 3 p.m., no later.

190
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,276
Need a $20 bill?

191
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,956
You need it.

192
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,549
Why did you make that crack
about responsibility?

193
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,874
Why didn't you tell me
about that audition?

194
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,039
Because I wasn't sure
whether I could make it.

195
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,199
I must have walked up and down
47th Street a dozen times.

196
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,757
- Don't keep things from me.
- I can't do it, can I?

197
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,238
Of course you can. You've got to try.
It's a perfect opportunity.

198
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,878
If I do take it, Georgie,
I'll need you every step of the way.

199
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,629
I don't have any appointments,
Frank, all winter.

200
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,799
- I wish it were a run-of-the-play...
- Why didn't you tell him?

201
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,152
I didn't want to antagonise him.
I have to work with him.

202
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,798
You'll never get a better deal,
so take it and do your level best.

203
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,877
Wait a minute. The two-weeks clause.

204
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,030
They can give me notice any time,
but I can give them notice, too.

205
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,598
- I can walk out any time I want.
- You mean you can quit, Frank.

206
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,553
Not the way you mean it.

207
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,709
If the show doesn't pan out, I don't
want to come to New York in a turkey.

208
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,674
Maybe this time, it will work out.
Bernie likes me.

209
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,635
Henry Johnson's pulling for me.
It's Cook I got to worry about.

210
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,914
We've been having trouble, Joe.

211
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,830
Instead of fields of wheat,
we got stubble rotting in the dust.

212
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,158
I've talked it over with Stella.
We're leaving.

213
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,557
What are we waiting for?
Let's push on.

214
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,513
- How about you, Joe?
- I'm staying.

215
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,269
They say when a man falls
from a great height,

216
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,436
his whole life flashes by.

217
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,519
In one split second,
he sees himself for what he is.

218
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,679
You don't have to plummet like a
hailstone to face that split second.

219
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,155
Mean it, Frank.

220
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,796
...plummet like a hailstone
to face that split second.

221
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,438
It can come to you as it did
to me today. As you stand...

222
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,598
- What is it?
- "...in a smouldering field."

223
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,954
As you stand in a smouldering field
and see your hopes go up in smoke.

224
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,119
This is the most important
decision in the man's life.

225
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,279
It sounds like he's deciding
what to have for breakfast!

226
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,710
That goes for the rest of you, too.

227
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,708
I'm sorry, but I'm still
fighting these words.

228
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,879
We've been in rehearsal ten days.
Let's take it from...

229
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,038
- Bernie.
- It can't be that late.

230
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,069
Where does it go? Knock off.
Same time tomorrow.

231
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,236
We'll start with this scene.

232
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,590
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

233
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,553
- Do you need me for anything?
- No.

234
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,719
- You want me to turn off the border?
- Yeah. Good night.

235
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,316
I'm sorry about the words.
I've had a lot of things on my mind.

236
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,476
I know you have.

237
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,231
Every time I give a direction,
you're off in space somewhere.

238
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,195
You can be great, but it demands
your concentration and energy.

239
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,836
I know. I keep telling myself that.

240
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,999
After rehearsal,
I go home to study and...

241
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,317
You've got headaches enough.
Good night.

242
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,674
- Frank? Having trouble at home?
- No, nothing like that.

243
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,917
- Don't you believe me?
- Everyone has trouble at home.

244
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,874
The ones who deny it
are those that have too much of it.

245
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,516
I denied it for five years
with the former Mrs Dodd.

246
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,156
I never had the impression
that you were married.

247
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,753
Neither did my wife.
That was my trouble. What's yours?

248
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,949
It's nothing important.
I'll see you in the morning.

249
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,119
- Does she want you to play the part?
- She's all for it.

250
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,675
The day I met her,

251
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,829
she seemed a little difficult
about terms, rather domineering.

252
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,157
- She wasn't always like that.
- I know.

253
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,909
They start out as Juliets
and wind up as Lady Macbeths.

254
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,069
When I first met her, she was as fine
a person as you've ever seen.

255
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,238
She had background and breeding.

256
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,912
She had a nobility about her that
made me feel proud to be with her.

257
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,469
I was a good deal older than she was,
but it didn't seem to matter.

258
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,240
She wasn't a flighty kid.

259
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,399
She had a poise and dignity
that was ageless.

260
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,479
Those first few years,
I never knew a better life.

261
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,119
A wife who was everything
I'd been looking for.

262
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,278
A son who was smart, healthy.

263
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,718
Then our son died.

264
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,356
I came home from the theatre
one night a couple of months later.

265
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:33,318
This kid, I don't think she ever
had a real drink in her life before.

266
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,798
There she is, stretched out
across the bed, dead drunk,

267
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,753
her wrists cut and bleeding.

268
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,629
She was jealous that I had my work,
something to live for.

269
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,990
She felt she had nothing.

270
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,479
Inside of a year,
she was a hopeless drunkard.

271
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,869
In an effort to give her
some purpose in life,

272
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,231
I made her feel that
I needed her in my work.

273
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,798
I let her pick the songs I should
record, the shows I ought to do.

274
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,950
She started taking over everything.
She became very possessive.

275
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,314
She wanted to make the decisions,
had to be with me all the time.

276
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,469
Whenever I was away, she acted
as if I'd run off with another woman.

277
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,638
She had fits of depression.

278
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,469
One time she set fire
to a hotel suite.

279
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,875
That's when I hit the bottle.

280
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,709
- Does she still drink?
- No. She stopped when I began.

281
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,790
That figures. You were the weak one
now. That's what she wanted.

282
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,949
- Do you have to bring her to Boston?
- I couldn't leave her alone.

283
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,711
You thought it was funny I didn't
hang around after the audition.

284
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,071
If I'd taken this part
without talking to her,

285
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,714
I don't know what would've happened.

286
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,878
I had to make believe
that I was afraid.

287
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,234
That left it open for her
to convince me, like it was her idea.

288
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,629
They can get awful bent out of shape,
can't they?

289
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,188
My wife was so twisted she said to
me, "I hope your next play's a flop,

290
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,349
"so the world can see I love you
even though you're a failure."

291
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,594
Georgie?

292
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,279
Just coming from a movie,
thought you might be through.

293
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,632
- Your timing was perfect, Mrs Elgin.
- I have a knack that way.

294
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,799
Good evening, Mr Dodd.
How is my husband doing?

295
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,754
In my less than humble opinion,
he's a natural.

296
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,316
Don't let him kid you, honey.
I was floundering.

297
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,470
We'll have to rehearse those cues.
Thank her for the words I did know.

298
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,796
Thanks.

299
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,356
- Did I intrude?
- No, we're just breaking up.

300
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,916
I don't like to be obtrusive
when Frank's working,

301
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,475
unless he needs my help.

302
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,638
- You're sure I'm not in the way?
- No.

303
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,709
We're just closing up shop,
giving it back to the theatre ghosts.

304
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,958
There's nothing quite so mysterious
and silent as a dark theatre.

305
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,116
A night without a star.

306
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,470
- Why don't we get some coffee?
- Georgie? She makes the decisions.

307
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,240
Is that true, Mrs Elgin?

308
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,592
To the extent that Frank's brought
out the mother in me, yes.

309
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,318
I'd like some coffee, and I'd like
to get to know Mr Dodd better.

310
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,273
I'd like to get to know you better.

311
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,436
Shall we go along?

312
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,756
Yes, the theatre is mysterious.

313
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,276
It sure is.

314
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,796
Hi, Charlie. Excuse me a minute.

315
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,958
No, thanks, never use them. Are you
really satisfied with Frank's work?

316
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,709
I'll be happy when he gets
the part out of his hands.

317
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,480
He has his worries with those lines.

318
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,911
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't add to them.

319
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,875
He seems to be more concerned
about you than the audience.

320
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,629
You mean he's too focused
on my reaction?

321
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,990
That's one way of putting it.

322
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,273
You could help by being careful
of what you do and say.

323
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,837
I try to be careful, but being
an actor's wife is not easy.

324
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,476
If I tell him he's magnificent,
he says I'm not honest.

325
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,639
- If not, he says I don't love him.
- He's good but can be better.

326
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,799
- Is that what the critics will say?
- Are you a critic or a wife?

327
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,436
I try in my small way to help.

328
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,997
That's what my ex-wife used to
keep reminding me, tearfully.

329
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,159
She had a theory that behind
every great man was a great woman.

330
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,079
She was convinced that she was great

331
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,239
and that all I needed
was guidance on her part.

332
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,159
She worked hard at it. Too hard.

333
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,716
It doesn't prove her theory
was completely wrong.

334
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,629
One could go through history
and find a few good examples.

335
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,277
It's a pity that Leonardo da Vinci
never had a wife to guide him.

336
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,438
He might have really got somewhere.

337
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,478
You know who that was? Charlie Blair.
You remember him. He was...

338
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,269
<i>Here's another oldie.</i>
<i>It's on the hit parade again.</i>

339
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,871
<i>Let's listen to the original</i>
<i>recording made by Frank Elgin.</i>

340
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,390
<i>He's backed up</i>
<i>by Jimmy Bolton's Orchestra.</i>

341
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,556
<i>See if you remember it.</i>

342
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,356
- Was that OK, Jimmy?
- Good.

343
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,516
Harry, you want to buy that one?

344
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,474
Sure will. I'll give you
the playback in a second.

345
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,069
Take five, boys.

346
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,676
You pretty near broke me up
with your bad beat. How'd it sound?

347
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,235
- It's a lovely tune.
- And the singer?

348
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,275
- He has a pleasant voice.
- If you were my agent, we'd starve!

349
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,630
I've got a hair appointment.

350
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,389
- You're not taking him.
- It's Sally's day off.

351
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,559
Oh, no. He'll grow up to be
a hairdresser. I'll take him.

352
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,593
To the Lambs' Club to play pool?

353
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,157
It's better than teaching him how to
set a wave. I'll take him to the zoo.

354
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,955
And bring him home full of peanuts,
ice cream and chocolate?

355
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,119
Johnny, tell this lady to run along.
This is strictly stag.

356
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,471
- Strictly stag.
- He's your responsibility.

357
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,629
If he gets a stomach ache in
the night, that's strictly stag, too.

358
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,398
Goodbye.

359
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,835
Isn't Mommy a doll?

360
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,832
Bye, hon.

361
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,476
- Peanuts!
- Yeah. First we'll hear this playback.

362
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,639
- Then Charlie wants some pictures.
- Take two of the chorus.

363
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,959
Can I get one shot of you looking at
the trademark for the album cover?

364
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,596
Make it fast. I got a date
with my friend here.

365
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,952
I think it would be better
without the hat. Right.

366
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,720
Put your hands on the record.

367
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,116
Put the right one at the bottom, too.
That's perfect. Just hold it.

368
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,278
Hold it. Hold it.

369
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,196
Johnny!

370
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,471
The men for the trunk
are downstairs...

371
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:40,070
- When did you get these, Frank?
- Last night, after you fell asleep.

372
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,229
I went out and got a paper and...
What's the difference?

373
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,194
- I got a good night's sleep.
- No more, Frank.

374
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,072
I'll get you some sleeping pills.
One a night can't hurt.

375
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,034
I'm not sure I'm going to Boston.

376
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,754
What's the use? I'll never
go through with this show.

377
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,758
I'll mess it up,
like everything else.

378
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,509
- That day was an accident.
- That's what the paper said.

379
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,475
- He was my responsibility that day.
- Frank, stop it! Stop!

380
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,757
- Have you told Dodd about this?
- No. Don't you tell him either.

381
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,080
I won't, but I think maybe
you should. It might help.

382
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,832
Nobody is going to have any respect.
He'd tell Cook. He'd fire me.

383
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,191
Who'd risk $200,000
on a guy that irresponsible?

384
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,349
Let's say you were responsible.
You've got to prove to yourself...

385
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,270
You don't know what it's like
to stand on that stage all alone.

386
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,119
If I'm no good, the show's no good.

387
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,111
I've got the future of 100 people
in my hand. This hand.

388
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,671
- Elgin, trunk for Boston?
- Come in.

389
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,476
- Theatre or hotel?
- Theatre.

390
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,478
- No...
- Everything's packed. It's ready.

391
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,958
"THE LAND AROUND US"
THEATRE

392
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,715
<i>Joe's nothing but a dreamer.</i>

393
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,879
<i>Let him show you</i>
<i>what he's been dreaming about.</i>

394
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,753
<i>That's fair enough. Come on, Phil.</i>

395
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,276
How do they expect me
to make these fast changes?

396
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,234
- Haven't I done it right?
- Yes, but I want you out front.

397
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,115
- Give me the dicky!
- You're doing wonderfully.

398
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,997
I am not! Why don't they get me
a dresser? They could afford a dozen.

399
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,634
- Do you want me to talk to Cook?
- Yes.

400
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,356
Tell him to stop that understudy
hovering there like a vulture.

401
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,518
- If you talked to Mr Dodd...
- You talk to him.

402
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,679
Tell him to keep that guy out front.
Get me some new tissue.

403
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,110
I will, right after rehearsal.

404
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,269
- I'm sorry I stepped on your line.
- Think nothing of it.

405
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,235
- I was so nervous.
- What about? It's just another show.

406
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,398
Where would you find
a star as sweet as that?

407
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,160
What a wonderful guy.

408
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,195
I'd like to hold the orchestra
for about a half-hour longer.

409
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:13,077
- Can't you do it in the morning?
- Can I take the doohickeys off?

410
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,840
- Yeah, go ahead.
- There we are.

411
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,191
- See you tomorrow.
- Paul mentioned something to me.

412
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,358
- Eleanor is way overboard.
- I know she is.

413
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,314
- I wasn't thinking about Eleanor.
- Don't you think I know?

414
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,672
- I have some notes.
- We'll go over them tomorrow.

415
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,317
Give the company a one o'clock call.
I'm going out for some fresh air.

416
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,957
Then we'll discuss that spot.
Larry, hold Frank and Helen.

417
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,109
Run the scene in front of the church.
Find out what caused the mix-up.

418
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,912
You talked about the scenery
but not about our real problem.

419
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,076
Elgin was terrible.

420
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,876
That's why you go out of town.
Actors improve. The scenery can't.

421
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,833
If he spoke the script,
I never heard it.

422
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,999
He trips on a rug, there's no chair,
the door won't open.

423
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,156
What do you expect of him?

424
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,679
Besides, his wife was backstage
during the performance.

425
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,429
- She's enough to upset anyone.
- What are you going to do?

426
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,031
- Lower the boom on her.
- He's your problem. I got my own.

427
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,676
The union insists I take on
three more stagehands.

428
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,829
Mr Cook, excuse me.
May I ask you something?

429
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,511
- Do you think Frank needs a dresser?
- No, but I suppose you do.

430
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,590
Well, those two fast changes.
It's a very large part, after all.

431
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,238
Bernie, every time you nod your head
like that, it costs us $200.

432
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,796
You're going to nod us
out of business.

433
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,918
Don't worry. We'll get him a dresser.

434
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:12,070
Mr Cook is almost what the bad fairy
promised Frank at his cradle.

435
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,229
He's not too bad.
Gruff, but with a heart of stone.

436
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,356
You smoke too much.

437
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,519
That's obvious.
A whole pack since 10.30.

438
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,870
Careful you don't catch cold.

439
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:37,438
After every first dress rehearsal,
I always hope to catch pneumonia.

440
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:43,476
It never works. Oh, for the peaceful
quiet of an oxygen tent.

441
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:50,438
Mr Dodd, who is that tall, gloomy man
that hangs around backstage?

442
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,596
Lucas, is that the name?

443
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,158
Yes. General understudy.
Not much personality but competent.

444
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,717
Well, excuse me for saying this,
but must he stay backstage?

445
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,876
It seems to bother Frank.

446
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,640
I'll watch him.

447
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,595
Is Frank that insecure?
He's working well, in good humour.

448
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,509
Don't you know what hides
behind that good humour?

449
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,870
Certain men are very strange.

450
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,436
Business couldn't be better,
wife and kids are fine,

451
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,995
jokes with the boys at the club.

452
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,079
The next day, he's hung himself
from the chandelier.

453
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,034
Is that supposed to be
a picture of Frank?

454
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,196
Yes and no.

455
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,555
Frank doesn't like to make a remark
that might lose him people's regard.

456
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,515
If anything has to be said
that might cause antagonism,

457
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,756
well, that's my job.

458
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,469
I hate to say this,
but I hired a good performer.

459
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,673
I may want him without
his sisters, cousins and aunts.

460
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:11,319
I never meant to interfere. I was
just offering myself as a liaison...

461
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,637
I have no problems with Frank.
Don't make any.

462
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,196
Before this is over,
you may face a couple of beauties.

463
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,836
- Is that a threat?
- No.

464
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,795
It's just a simple statement
based on experience.

465
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,959
Whether you like it or not,
Frank's weak. He's a leaner.

466
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,596
I happen to be the one he leans on.

467
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,075
A good, strong helpmate.

468
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,637
You and your strength might be
the very reason he is weak.

469
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,400
I don't like strong women.

470
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,876
I'm not here to audition for you.

471
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,038
I'm here for the same reason you are,

472
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,677
to do everything in my power
to make him a success in this.

473
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:01,432
I want to see Frank stand on his own
two feet for very personal reasons.

474
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,794
Then don't overplay your hand. Frank
can go anywhere, right to the top.

475
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,437
Or he may go back to
that smelly room, and you with him!

476
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,109
I got that line straightened out.
Helen was throwing me the wrong cue.

477
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,276
I'm glad you got it fixed.

478
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,235
Frank, I noticed the understudy
backstage. Does that bother you?

479
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,878
No, never even noticed. How else
is he going to learn his business?

480
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,276
- Is that you, Georgie?
- Yes.

481
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,756
- Are you coming in?
- In a minute.

482
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,918
I want to get a breath of fresh air.

483
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:55,559
I can't come out. I'm still soggy.
What did they say about the dresser?

484
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,716
You'll get him.

485
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,359
It looks like they've got a little
respect for the old man after all.

486
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,314
Yes, they have respect for you.

487
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,476
I'll be out in a second.

488
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,231
- It's a different kind of a show.
- Yes, but I'm enjoying it.

489
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,877
It's a beautiful production.
I bet the costumes cost $50,000.

490
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,833
I think it's the most exciting thing!

491
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,794
- Where did you get it?
- From George, for my birthday.

492
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,597
You've seen him before, years ago,
in that show in Central Park.

493
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:56,237
- Was he the same one?
- So easy-going and likeable.

494
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,756
- Are you catching cold?
- That's all I need.

495
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,758
You're smoking too much. Go to sleep.

496
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,114
- I want to see the review first.
- You can see it at breakfast.

497
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:31,270
I can't sleep. What time do they
deliver the paper? In the afternoon?

498
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,916
I don't know why they picked
this place to open in.

499
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,556
It's like getting locked
in a deep freeze.

500
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,956
Just came in, Mr Elgin.

501
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,593
I'll get you another sleeping pill.

502
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,154
- Hello.
- I didn't think I'd be waking you.

503
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,273
The only important ones
are the New York notices.

504
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,429
Yeah, I don't worry about
these out-of-town critics.

505
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,596
They don't bother me.

506
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,957
Georgie was a little upset,
but I reminded her of <i>Lonesome Town</i>.

507
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,995
The Philadelphia critics murdered us,
but in New York we were a smash.

508
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,832
We've got five weeks. Opening night
in New York, it'll be great.

509
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,830
<i>But let's not kid ourselves.</i>
<i>It'll take an awful lot of work.</i>

510
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,794
You've got a big day tomorrow,
a rehearsal, a performance

511
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,152
and production stills after that,
so get all the rest you can.

512
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,316
- <i>OK.</i>
- Good night.

513
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,108
The dame in this paper
puts her finger right on it.

514
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,758
She says, "Elgin lacks authority
in a role that cries for it."

515
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,909
- No authority. That's it.
- You know why he lacks authority?

516
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:52,070
Because his wife has too much of it.
She's got to go back to New York.

517
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,034
We ought to make it
transportation for two.

518
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,677
If you don't like what I'm doing,
make it transportation for three.

519
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,711
Now, we were discussing that scene
in front of the town hall.

520
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,869
We go past the climax. Let's cut
the scene here tomorrow night.

521
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,469
- Over a little more. That's it.
- Everybody out front, keep quiet.

522
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,559
Sit down and keep quiet
or you'll be here all night.

523
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,716
Settle down.

524
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,309
All right, here we go.

525
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,478
Stay! Hold it!

526
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,434
- OK, go ahead.
- Hold it. Thank you.

527
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,918
Hold those positions.
I want to change one thing here.

528
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,591
While Frank is speaking,
I want you to look directly at him.

529
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:55,238
And no movement, nothing that will
distract the audience from him.

530
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,796
He's got to be
the centre of attention.

531
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,437
You really think
it would be better that way?

532
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,873
I thought it would be kind of nice
and natural if I was in the crowd.

533
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,675
No, it's all wrong.
The words lose importance.

534
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,237
He's asking these people
to have faith in him, to trust him.

535
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:23,879
He's accepting responsibility for
their future. It's got to be important.

536
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,596
We'll rehearse it tomorrow.
I just wanted to tell you about it.

537
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,555
We've got one more shot where
you're here looking at the poster.

538
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,676
Yell when you're ready.

539
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,075
Turn your head towards the poster.

540
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,590
- Would you look at the poster?
- Yeah, sure.

541
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,917
WANTED FOR MURDER

542
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,192
- Hold it.
- <i>Put your hands on the record.</i>

543
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,356
<i>Hold it.</i>

544
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,871
- Frank, what's the matter?
- I got a cold.

545
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,039
I've got some stuff in the room.
I'll be right back.

546
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,476
- All finished?
- No.

547
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,514
Frank, I don't like that cough syrup.

548
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:38,068
- Why not? It's a buck a bottle.
- You can read labels.

549
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:44,230
It's 22% alcohol. I'll get you
some lemon and honey in the morning.

550
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,434
Cook didn't come back after the show.

551
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,596
No, he didn't.

552
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,635
I'm glad I got that two-weeks clause.
I can quit any time I want.

553
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,274
Why should I care? They don't.

554
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,631
The producer doesn't come back
after the show...

555
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,798
- Leave the bottle.
- I need it for my cough.

556
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,958
- Leave it here.
- But I need it.

557
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,958
George, I need it.

558
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,959
- Frank's on stage.
- I know. I want to talk to you.

559
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,479
Last time we talked, Mr Dodd,
you reduced me to tears.

560
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:49,754
I promise you it won't happen again.
In fact, I'm glad you're here.

561
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,715
You ought to know he's getting a cold
and shouldn't be kept up late.

562
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,673
- We need stills. How's his spirit?
- Low.

563
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,314
- Why?
- Ask the Boston critics.

564
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,069
I've spent between
10 and 15 hours a day with Frank.

565
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,431
Nothing bothers him
except through your mouth.

566
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,596
We've been through that.

567
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:15,670
Either he laughs and makes bad jokes
or sits in silence and rots inside.

568
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,839
Either way, for your edification,
he's heading for a bender.

569
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:24,591
Why do women always think they
understand men better than men do?

570
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,553
Maybe because they live with them.

571
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,150
You'll have him full of whisky
before morning.

572
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,399
He's getting a cold. That's a reason
to jump down the well.

573
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:41,152
Why work so hard? You handle him,
and now you're trying to handle me!

574
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:45,797
And don't think I couldn't,
after handling a cunning drunkard.

575
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,994
If you loved this man, you could
never call him a cunning drunkard.

576
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,634
I have a greater love for the truth.

577
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,798
I'm a drunkard's wife.
That's the truth.

578
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,278
Stop looking at everything
as if it were a musical comedy!

579
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,914
I find you slightly grotesque.

580
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,272
You came here to tell me
something. What is it?

581
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,429
Cook's got a replacement for Frank
and a lot of money to protect.

582
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,269
I think Frank will improve.
Cook thinks he won't.

583
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:22,634
- Well, he won't unless you leave.
- You'll be sorry. He'll be helpless.

584
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,789
- I'll help him.
- You wouldn't know where to begin!

585
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,629
I'll begin by not calling him
a cunning drunkard.

586
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,799
I'll give him confidence
by rejoicing in his talents

587
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,037
instead of reminding him
of his weaknesses.

588
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,312
I'll let him face a decision
without fear.

589
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,954
I won't stifle him with bitterness.

590
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,119
I might bend the truth, but I'll get
a performance out of him.

591
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:54,599
That's the difference. You want him
to become the actor he once was.

592
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:00,557
I'm his wife. I want him once more
as the man he once was,

593
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,710
able to face responsibility, and you
don't do that by bending the truth!

594
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,356
You don't do it by stripping him
of self-respect.

595
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,994
I'll fight you for this man.

596
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,998
Not too hard. I may let you have him.

597
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,591
Oh, no. You want him wholly
and utterly dependent.

598
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,749
You realised, with all your fine
breeding, you were a failure.

599
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:30,909
It gave you a feeling of power
to control someone else's life.

600
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:36,069
Worse, you do it in the name of love.
You're as phoney as an opera soprano.

601
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,711
Did I forget to tell you I'm proud?

602
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:51,759
Make up your mind. Either you go
to New York alone, or you both go.

603
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,119
I'll go, on one condition.

604
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,757
Let me tell Frank in my own way,
in my own time.

605
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,479
As long as you're on that train
by tomorrow night.

606
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,356
- The traffic's a little heavy!
- Finished?

607
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,516
Got it all wrapped up.

608
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:30,959
Frank, I'd like to run through that
new scene after the matinée tomorrow.

609
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,116
- You tired?
- Me?

610
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,871
How can you be tired playing a part
you've waited for all your life?

611
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:42,358
- Your energy was low again tonight.
- I know. It's this cold.

612
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,518
- Are you sure it's not nerves?
- Are you kidding?

613
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,474
- Tell him what's bothering you.
- What's bothering me?

614
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,116
- Cook and the notices, for instance.
- Oh, that.

615
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,357
I just wondered why
he didn't come backstage.

616
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,712
Is he mad or something?
Those weren't exactly money notices.

617
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:07,678
Mr Dodd believes in you. I can't
help you if you're worried. He can.

618
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,836
But I'm not worried.

619
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,793
Did you not tell me ten minutes ago

620
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,958
that you wanted
to hand in your notice?

621
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,310
I was just ribbing you, honey.

622
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:23,514
You got to be careful around here.
You can't open your mouth.

623
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:28,669
- Your wife's returning to New York.
- I said nothing of the sort.

624
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:38,113
- What do you mean, New York?
- We can talk about it later.

625
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,278
Would you leave us alone, Mrs Elgin?

626
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,470
Let's get one thing straight.

627
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,560
- What is that?
- It's cough syrup.

628
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,719
Pine, tar, cherries,
a whole bush in a bottle.

629
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,869
- This stuff is 22% alcohol.
- Alcohol?

630
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,231
I told Georgie to get something
to loosen my throat.

631
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,797
- Don't you know what these can do?
- She didn't look at the label.

632
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,356
Maybe she did. She's jealous
of the show and of me.

633
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,916
This is how far she'd go.
She'd even kick you off the wagon.

634
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:27,079
- I know she's high-strung...
- I want her back in New York.

635
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,831
We've got hard work ahead. I haven't
time for frustrated females.

636
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,994
Go back to the hotel and get some
sleep. I want you fresh tomorrow.

637
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:52,190
Mrs Elgin, Frank knows
exactly how I feel.

638
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,871
He appreciates what has to be done.
See you tomorrow, Frank.

639
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,676
He can be pretty arrogant
and insulting.

640
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,031
He had no right
to treat you like that.

641
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,196
Did you tell him that?

642
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,958
I poured it in the sink. If you
don't believe me, go and smell it.

643
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,671
- Where's the other bottle?
- What other bottle?

644
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,190
I'm tired. Where's
the other bottle of syrup?

645
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,838
I didn't buy another bottle. I wish
you'd take my word for something.

646
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,794
Never mind. I give up.
I'm not going to look.

647
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:49,394
- I apologise. He had no right...
- Stop putting on a front.

648
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,549
- Who's putting on a front?
- You are! You lie, you lie, you lie!

649
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,392
- Are you going back to New York?
- I don't know why not.

650
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,750
You want to leave me, don't you?

651
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,909
At the moment, I want you to get
dressed so we can get out of here.

652
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,829
Who's in New York? Who's the guy
you want to get back to?

653
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,919
I'm going to hit you
with the first thing I pick up!

654
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,669
- Now get dressed!
- If you're in such a hurry, go on.

655
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,838
I'll take a walk,
get something to eat.

656
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:31,397
- It won't do your cold any good.
- Let them worry about it.

657
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,559
- Do you want me to go?
- Yes, if you're in such a hurry.

658
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,197
Have you got the key to the room?
I'll get one from the hotel.

659
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:45,952
Don't wake me up when you come in.
I may be having a happy dream!

660
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,115
- 65, 75.
- That's for you.

661
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,276
Thanks.

662
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,398
Do you like me?

663
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,149
You're one of the most likeable guys
I've ever seen.

664
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:35,319
- Jackie, sing something!
- I'll sing if you'll be quiet.

665
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,876
- Yeah, <i>Love And Learn</i>.
- All right, simmer down.

666
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,036
It's my turn to holler.

667
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,355
Go, dad, go!

668
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,952
What about this guy?

669
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,550
Take me home, dad.

670
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,273
Hey, aren't you Frank Elgin?

671
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,551
I used to be. Not a word
or I'll tell them you're Harpo Marx.

672
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,309
- <i>The Pump Song!</i>
- I'm tired. Dance a while.

673
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,954
Order up. Buy something already.

674
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,398
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Another?

675
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,353
Yeah. Give me a double.

676
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:22,958
Pour, pour. Go ahead, fill it up.
Sorry about that drink.

677
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:28,314
It's all right. Could have happened
to anybody. Just an accident.

678
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,476
Yeah. Just an accident.

679
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:38,272
That's what the papers said.
It could have happened to anybody.

680
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,436
It was just an accident.

681
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,954
- Come in.
- Morning.

682
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,151
- Morning.
- How's it going?

683
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,920
- We got out 23 minutes.
- That's fine.

684
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,079
If we cut that chorus in half,
what will that give us?

685
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:39,239
- Another seven minutes.
- Good. That's where we need it.

686
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,396
Hello? Yeah.

687
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,476
What? When?

688
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,274
- Oh, no.
- I think you'd better come down.

689
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,436
I'll wait for you.

690
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,390
- Here's his keys, his belt.
- I know, I know.

691
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,149
75, 85, 90.

692
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,875
Here's your five dollars.

693
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:16,198
You promised me a couple of problems.
I see you made good your threat.

694
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,153
I didn't threaten you. I warned you.

695
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,871
When he hadn't come in,
why didn't you call me?

696
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,631
- Suppose he had been with a woman?
- You're being evasive.

697
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,676
Sit down, Frank.

698
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,554
Get me some water, Georgie.

699
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:59,189
What happened, Frank? Sit up!
Don't act as though I'm beating you.

700
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,153
- I'm sorry.
- What happened?

701
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:05,875
- I don't know.
- What happened after I left you?

702
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,038
- Georgie and I had a fight.
- I thought so.

703
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,993
- I don't know...
- She picked a fine time.

704
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,556
- It wasn't her fault.
- Stop protecting her!

705
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,719
- She's weak, she's so weak.
- She's driven you to drink!

706
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,390
You could be magnificent.
She goes back to New York.

707
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,151
- I don't know what she'd do.
- She goes back this morning.

708
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,430
- She's weak.
- I'll talk to her.

709
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,995
If we go on, you move in with me.

710
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,351
- Cook doesn't want me.
- I'm not sure I want you!

711
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,348
Whatever you say. You decide.

712
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,796
Frank...

713
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,479
Frank stays, you go. The management
will pay your expenses.

714
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:02,071
Frank may follow you, I'm not sure.
He's moving in with me.

715
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:07,718
Crisp as lettuce, aren't you?
Do you want me to go, Frank?

716
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,476
I'll go and pack.

717
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:22,959
Tell Frank he has nothing to worry
about. He thinks you may go drastic.

718
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,197
- It's happened before, I understand.
- What?

719
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,153
Phoney suicide attempts.

720
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,636
Mr Dodd, when I was a child,

721
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,595
the town idiot insisted that
elephant tusks came from piano keys,

722
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,394
but he had nothing on you.

723
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,956
Suicide attempts
are Frank's department.

724
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,116
Show me your wrists, Frank.
Show me your wrists!

725
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:41,269
- Did you set fire to a hotel suite?
- He told you that?

726
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,475
Was I a hopeless drunk?

727
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:52,310
Did I have fits of depression?
Was I possessive?

728
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:57,958
Did I have to have a nurse
watch me when he was on stage?

729
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,913
Didn't you recognise any of it?

730
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:06,079
That was his big speech in one of
the plays you admired him in

731
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,033
when you were a hat-check boy.

732
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:27,829
Larry... do you think the understudy
can play the matinée?

733
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,280
Yeah, I think so.

734
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:37,031
Pay the fine. This is a receipt
for his coat, wallet and the rest.

735
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,198
Take him back to the hotel.

736
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,951
Wait. If they see him in the lobby,
it'll be all over the papers.

737
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:49,119
Take him to the theatre
and let him sleep it off there.

738
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,276
- Georgie...
- Go on, Frank.

739
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,756
I won't leave without seeing you.

740
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,713
Tell Cook I'll be along in a few minutes.

741
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,679
- May I smoke?
- May you smoke?

742
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,839
What is that supposed to be?
Homage to a lady?

743
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:25,477
It'll never make me forgive you
for what you've said and done.

744
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,310
I'm not asking for forgiveness.
I want information.

745
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:38,277
- What made Frank go to pieces?
- The responsibility became too much.

746
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,439
- Why the lying, why the cunning?
- He hates himself.

747
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:47,998
Consequently, he'll do or say
anything to be liked by others.

748
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,634
People like Frank ought to have
two votes.

749
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:54,150
Then they could vote
Democrat and Republican.

750
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,316
Everybody would love them.

751
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:02,959
- Was he always like that?
- No. No, he drank a little.

752
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,116
He wasn't too dependable,

753
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:11,270
but it was only a pathetic hint of
frailty in a wonderful, glowing man.

754
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:18,071
That appeals to a lot of us.
It did to me. I was so young.

755
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:23,832
His weaknesses seemed touching and
sweet. They made me love him more.

756
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,836
One day, he was walking with our son.
He let go of his hand.

757
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:38,194
There was traffic. He looked
the other way. The boy was killed.

758
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,588
Ever since then, Frank has acted
like a murderer.

759
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,759
Guilt and repentance
and all that goes with it.

760
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,910
But worse than that, he's shunned
any responsibility like the plague.

761
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,273
It covered a pretty wide range.

762
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:05,838
Everything from not wanting
any more children to...

763
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:11,990
It must sound ludicrous to anyone
who hasn't lived through it.

764
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:17,638
It got to the point that he wouldn't
pick out a coat or suit by himself.

765
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,069
I don't know where to begin
to apologise, Mrs Elgin.

766
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:31,239
You can begin
by not calling me Mrs Elgin.

767
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,911
- And you never left him?
- Twice left, twice returned.

768
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:40,955
He's a helpless child.
Anyone taking a cab to New York?

769
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,515
If he's as helpless as you say...

770
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,030
He's not helpless now.
He has you, Mr Dodd.

771
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:51,472
You're the only one that can
handle him. I didn't know it before.

772
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:55,958
- Then you've learned something.
- The man has to be watched.

773
01:16:56,160 --> 01:17:00,597
You take the job with waving banners
and ten hours later hand it back!

774
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:06,750
He has to be watched? He has to be
nursed and guarded, but not by me!

775
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,919
I'm going back to New York,
to the comfort of a quiet room.

776
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,873
I won't have to wonder where he is.

777
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,311
He'll be in the strong hands
of Bernie Dodd!

778
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,957
Can you stand him on his feet?
That's where my prayers have gone.

779
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:25,914
To see that holy hour
when he can stand alone again.

780
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,270
I might forgive you, Mr Dodd,

781
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,234
if you can keep him up long enough
for me to get out from under.

782
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,797
All I want is my own name and
a job to buy sugar for my coffee.

783
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,279
You can't believe that a woman
is crazy-out-of-her-mind

784
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,233
to live alone in one room,
by herself!

785
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,353
- Listen to me!
- Why are you holding me?

786
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:11,757
How could you be so angry
at someone you didn't even know?

787
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,276
Maybe I really wasn't.

788
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:23,994
Maybe I screamed at you to keep
myself at an angry distance.

789
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:29,149
No one has looked at me
as a woman for years and years.

790
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:34,756
I never knew there was such a woman.

791
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,713
Loyal, steadfast.

792
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,754
And when I found her...

793
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:52,075
Now I need your answer.
Do you think Frank can make it?

794
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,478
I don't know.

795
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:02,629
But if he doesn't go through with
this show, he'll never work again.

796
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,799
- I'm sure of that.
- You'll be taking a big chance.

797
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:12,198
They're the only ones worth taking.

798
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,391
But I can't unless you stay.
Will you?

799
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,592
Yes.

800
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,116
You kissed me.

801
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:39,876
Don't let it give you
any ideas, Mr Dodd.

802
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,397
No, Mrs Elgin.

803
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:03,159
It's more thoughtful. He's trying
to figure out an approach...

804
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,316
- Did you see Cook?
- No.

805
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,476
He's talking to Watson.

806
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,636
I haven't got time now.

807
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,669
I've been with the understudy.
Do you want to listen?

808
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,472
Not now.

809
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:28,918
- How do you feel?
- OK. Larry got me some coffee.

810
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,076
I'll be out in a minute.

811
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:36,070
You don't have to get out.
All you have to do is get some sleep.

812
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,714
The understudy will want to get in.

813
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:43,357
I listened to him. He's no good.
You'll have to play the matinée.

814
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,518
Oh, no. Don't stick your neck out.

815
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:53,189
I'm in no mood to cut my throat
in public. The understudy stinks.

816
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:57,234
It's not just the matinée.
You've got to replace me.

817
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,591
When you took this job,
I promised you no pity.

818
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,952
I don't expect any.
I'm only warning you. Get rid of me.

819
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,310
Let me go back to New York.

820
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:13,869
So you can tell the boys you quit
because the part wasn't big enough?

821
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:19,234
Oh, no. If you leave this show,
it'll only be for one reason.

822
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:24,195
Because I fire you for being
an unreliable, slobbering drunk.

823
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,110
I know a lot of people who hire
actors. That's what I'll tell them.

824
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,629
It's not just this performance.

825
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,709
I can do a show for you. I've gone on
when I can hardly stand up.

826
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,878
It's not when I'm out there
that it's bad.

827
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:44,596
This is a matinée in Boston. If I do
this in New York, where are you?

828
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,076
- Where are you?
- You talk as if I do it on purpose.

829
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,033
I can't help it, Bernie.

830
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:57,950
In between shows and at night,
when I start thinking about it...

831
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:02,517
You mean the accident?
Georgie told me about it.

832
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:06,679
- It hasn't been easy.
- Why didn't you tell me about it?

833
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,838
- I don't know.
- You knew I wouldn't buy it.

834
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:13,589
I don't buy it. A crazy wife.
Yes, you knew I had one.

835
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,553
- It was an accident.
- It was a crutch.

836
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:21,515
You were getting older, beginning
to slip. You looked for excuses.

837
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,676
The accident was an excuse.

838
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:29,034
Everybody expects a guy to take that
pretty hard. You used it to the hilt.

839
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,550
- No, Bernie.
- I'm right, and you know it.

840
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,914
You're sure of yourself. You don't
know what it means to be afraid.

841
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,076
You're on top of the heap.

842
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,717
Everything's good for you, but wait
till you've had a couple of flops

843
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,275
and people stop talking about you.

844
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,438
You'll get afraid
and look for excuses.

845
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,438
I'm not blaming you. Just stop lying.

846
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:58,599
Sure, everybody thought
it was because of the accident.

847
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,749
That's what I wanted them to think,
because I was afraid.

848
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:09,114
Even when I was the biggest, I was
afraid. I've always been afraid.

849
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:15,759
I don't know why. It was good to find
a respectable excuse for failure.

850
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:20,715
I could drink a little more.
Nobody blamed me.

851
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,673
No, they blamed it on the accident.

852
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,678
After I'd milked every tear out of it,

853
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,031
I cut my wrists,
not deep enough to die,

854
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:36,995
just enough to bleed myself back
into the centre of attention.

855
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,636
Everybody felt sorry for me again.

856
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:46,790
They understood. Everybody
was talking about me and my tragedy.

857
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,150
That's the way I wanted it.

858
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:54,309
To keep it that way, I lied.
God, how I lied!

859
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,796
I even lied about Georgie!

860
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,640
You were so right, Bernie.
I keep thinking about it.

861
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:10,799
Not about the accident,
but how I used it.

862
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,798
- Get some rest.
- I'll keep on thinking about it.

863
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,949
You better not take a chance on me.
You better get rid of me.

864
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,752
- Bernie...
- Shh.

865
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,549
- <i>He's got to sleep.</i>
- <i>I don't care if he hears me.</i>

866
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,513
<i>I talked to Ray Watson in California.</i>

867
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:46,269
<i>He can be here in the morning.</i>
<i>I said I'd call him back.</i>

868
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,756
- <i>Frank's going to play it.</i>
- <i>Wait a minute.</i>

869
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,919
<i>Don't protect this guy any longer!</i>
<i>I'm calling Ray Watson.</i>

870
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:58,079
<i>If you do, tell him to bring</i>
<i>a director along with him.</i>

871
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:18,357
THE LAND AROUND US

872
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:30,958
All that valley needs is a few
friends to treat it kindly for once,

873
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:35,472
to loan it a plough, some seeds,
plenty of care.

874
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,636
It'll pay us back.

875
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,391
I know it, Joe, but the others
will take a lot of convincing.

876
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,751
- Western Union.
- Yes, come in.

877
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,069
- How's it going, Ralph?
- Fine, Mr Dodd.

878
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:13,432
Mr Frank's a big man.
Positive honour to work for him.

879
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:18,069
- Have you been out front?
- Yeah.

880
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:22,239
Opening night in New York.
The world's most useless man.

881
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:26,911
- How's Frank?
- OK. How's it been back here?

882
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:31,079
He was a little uneasy
with the curtain going up so late.

883
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,431
If the first few rows
had the balcony's manners,

884
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,393
what a wonderful world this would be.

885
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,751
It was sweet of you
to send these wires.

886
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,316
- Who told you?
- I guessed. How many did you send?

887
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,876
- Nine or ten. You?
- Five or six.

888
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,150
Where did you get the names?

889
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,316
The Lambs' Club.

890
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:59,159
Good, good.
Why don't you go out front?

891
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:04,957
Not me. I don't sit with the critics.
I hear very well right from here.

892
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,311
That's the advantage
of an on-stage dressing room.

893
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,476
Keep quiet!

894
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,956
That's the disadvantage.

895
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:23,837
Larry's right. From now on,
it's his show. I'm just a visitor.

896
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,999
- Depressed, aren't you?
- Depressed and mean.

897
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:35,670
It's been a long nine weeks.
A job is home to a homeless man.

898
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,476
Now the job is finished.

899
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,476
Where do I go from here?

900
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,949
Georgie, five weeks ago
I kissed a woman, a married woman.

901
01:27:56,120 --> 01:28:00,079
Now I know I love her.
I don't know where to turn.

902
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:06,195
- Close to you like this...
- Bernie...

903
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,196
I waited.

904
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,960
- Are you going to leave him?
- Bernie...

905
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:17,392
You told me you prayed to see him on
his feet again so you could get out.

906
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,034
Let me show you something.

907
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,319
Looks to me like he's made it.
What about you?

908
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:44,479
- Are you leaving him?
- Don't you think that can wait?

909
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:49,117
No, it's been on my mind
since that morning in Boston.

910
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,754
If I could make you understand...

911
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,918
Not now, Bernie. Not now.

912
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:05,275
First-act curtain. I've got to make
the dressing room tour.

913
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,471
- <i>I thought you were out front.</i>
- <i>Just came back.</i>

914
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,830
<i>You hit it tonight. It's good.</i>

915
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:20,109
I can handle this. Go have a smoke.
You know something, that's work.

916
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,276
It sounded wonderful back here.

917
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,870
I messed up a couple of spots.
Nobody noticed.

918
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:31,029
- You'd better touch up the grey.
- Make me look two weeks younger.

919
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:42,638
- How do you feel?
- Good. How are they liking it?

920
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,799
I only know what I read
in the papers. They came in late.

921
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,470
- As long as they don't leave early.
- Frank...

922
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:54,434
A lot of things are said
in the heat of the day.

923
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,596
Accept my apologies.

924
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:02,238
Those things can happen. Naturally,
you include my wife in your apology.

925
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:05,955
Of course. That includes you, too.

926
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:11,439
Then start by taking your hat off.
You're not at a smoker, Mr Cook.

927
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:20,078
This is the first kind word you've
had for us. I think I know why.

928
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:24,239
You'd like me to sign a contract
before the papers come out

929
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:27,989
so you can get me
for half what I'm worth.

930
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,634
You'll just have to take my word.

931
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:34,389
I have been thinking
of contractual arrangements,

932
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:37,034
but that's not why I came back.

933
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:41,756
I'm having some people for supper,
and I just wanted to invite you.

934
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:44,076
And you, Mrs Elgin.

935
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:48,034
Thanks. I'll drop by
if I'm not too tired.

936
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,437
- Good. Hope to see you.
- Yeah.

937
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:57,671
Excuse me, Mrs Elgin.
We'll be looking for you.

938
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,836
Thank you.

939
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,829
- Fine performance.
- Thank you. They got you trapped!

940
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,600
- Don't learn the piano.
- Just <i>Chopsticks.</i>

941
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,155
- Great performance.
- Thank you.

942
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,950
- Have you seen Georgie anywhere?
- She was here a minute ago.

943
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,629
There you are, dear.
I only lost about half of it.

944
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:03,435
Now is as good a time as any
to say thanks to both of you.

945
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:04,914
For what?

946
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:09,079
If it hadn't been for you,
Ray Watson would be here now,

947
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,236
looking for a coffee spoon.

948
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:15,911
Frank, there are as many reasons
for drinking as there are drinkers.

949
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:19,669
There are only two reasons
why a drinker stops.

950
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:24,192
He dies or decides to quit
all by himself.

951
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,676
I'm not sure I have.

952
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,668
I faced a crisis up in Boston
and got away with it.

953
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:38,830
Just about anybody can face a crisis.
It's everyday living that's rough.

954
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:46,038
I'm not sure I can lick it,
but I think I got a chance.

955
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,958
The point is, Georgie, what about us?

956
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:57,034
Don't go, Bernie. You're involved.

957
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:02,189
There's only one thing more obvious
than two people gazing at each other,

958
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,676
and that's two people avoiding it.

959
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:09,839
Frank, I didn't want to bring up
any of this tonight.

960
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:13,191
But you did, so let's have
the whole truth.

961
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:16,756
I married you for happiness.
Yours and mine.

962
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,714
If necessary, I'll leave you
for the same reason.

963
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:24,196
I can't guarantee you that happiness.

964
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:30,350
The rest of the whole truth is that
it was as much my fault as yours.

965
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,394
Bernie accused me of wanting you
completely dependent,

966
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,558
of wanting to control your life.

967
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,914
I denied it, of course, but I think
there's an element of truth there.

968
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:47,079
I don't want to run that risk again.

969
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,236
No, you're right.

970
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:52,796
This is something
I've got to work out for myself,

971
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,956
with you or without you.

972
01:34:55,160 --> 01:35:00,109
Whether the show is a hit
or a flop is beside the point.

973
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,871
I've got to find myself,
whether it's in one room or five.

974
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:12,470
I don't think there's any point in us
torturing each other any longer.

975
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:15,433
You two talk it over. I'll go home.

976
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:20,076
But, Georgie, don't dismiss
what we had together.

977
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,999
I gave you ten of the roughest years

978
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:26,988
anybody ever spent outside
of a concentration camp.

979
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,953
It could be more of the same.

980
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:43,675
That was quite a little speech.
I'm still giving a performance.

981
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:50,228
This time there's a difference.
At least I know it's a performance.

982
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:12,756
I know it's gratifying
to be wanted and needed,

983
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,111
but not for every minute
of every day.

984
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:21,269
Remember that for years he's been
a leaner. You said so yourself.

985
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,949
- Pretty tune, isn't it? Remember it?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

986
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:54,674
I made a record of it once.

987
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:52,314
Bernie, I...

988
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:55,080
I'm always running out of cigarettes.

989
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:59,034
- You smoke too much.
- And you're impertinent.

990
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:06,518
But you're loyal and steadfast
and devoted.

991
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,476
I like that in a woman.

992
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:38,479
- Have you seen Frank anywhere?
- He just left, Mrs Elgin.

993
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,956
- Here you are.
- About time!

994
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:45,720
- How are they?
- I didn't read them.

995
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,590
- Here's <i>The Times</i> and <i>Tribune</i>.
- Thanks, Larry.
