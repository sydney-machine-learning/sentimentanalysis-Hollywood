1
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,153
<i>Men, are you over 40?</i>

2
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,960
<i>When you wake up in the morning,
do you feel tired and rundown?</i>

3
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,216
<i>Do you have that
listless feeling?</i>

4
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,356
Jefferies.

5
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,616
<i>Congratulations, Jeff.</i>

6
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
For what?

7
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,399
<i>For getting rid
of that cast.</i>

8
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,437
Who said I was
getting rid of it?

9
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,954
<i>This is Wednesday.</i>

10
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,829
<i>Seven weeks from the day
you broke your leg. Yes or no?</i>

11
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,551
Gunnison, how did you ever get to be such
a big editor with such a small memory?

12
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,597
<i>Thrift, industry
and hard work.</i>

13
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,752
<i>And catching the publisher
with his secretary.</i>

14
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
<i>Did I get
the wrong day?</i>

15
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,593
No.

16
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,433
No, wrong week.

17
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,151
Next Wednesday I emerge
from this plaster cocoon.

18
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,277
<i>That's too
bad, Jeff.</i>

19
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,159
<i>Well, I guess I can't
be lucky every day.</i>

20
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,594
<i>Forget I called.</i>

21
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,957
Yeah, I sure feel sorry
for you, Gunnison.

22
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,670
Must be rough on you thinking of me
wearing this cast for another whole week.

23
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,639
<i>That one week is gonna cost me
my best photographer</i>

24
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,951
<i>and you a big
assignment.</i>

25
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Where?

26
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,833
<i>There's no point in
even talking about it.</i>

27
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,513
Oh, come on,
come on. Where?

28
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,159
<i>Kashmir.</i>

29
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,835
<i>Got a code tip
from the bureau chief this morning.</i>

30
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,679
<i>The place is about
to go up in smoke.</i>

31
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,521
What did I tell you? Didn't I tell you
that's the next place to watch?

32
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
<i>You did.</i>

33
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,036
Okay. When do I leave?
Half-hour? Hour?

34
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,316
<i>With that cast
on? You don't.</i>

35
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,676
Stop sounding stuffy.

36
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,640
I can take pictures from a jeep
or a water buffalo, if necessary.

37
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,838
<i>You're too valuable to the magazine
for us to play around with.</i>

38
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,752
<i>I'll send Morgan
or Lambert.</i>

39
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,752
Morgan or Lambert.
That's fine.

40
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,950
I get myself
half-killed for you,

41
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,600
and you reward me
by stealing my assignments.

42
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,356
<i>I didn't ask you to stand in the middle
of that automobile racetrack.</i>

43
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,957
You asked for something
dramatically different. You got it.

44
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,470
<i>So did you.
Goodbye, Jeff.</i>

45
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,031
Now wait a minute, Gunnison.
You've got to get me out of here.

46
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,555
Six weeks sitting in
a two-room apartment

47
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,936
with nothing to do but look out
the window at the neighbors.

48
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
<i>Bye, Jeff.</i>

49
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,360
No, Gunnison, I...

50
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,239
If you don't pull me out
of this swamp of boredom,

51
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,152
I'm gonna do
something drastic.

52
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
<i>Like what?</i>

53
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,416
"Like what?"
I'm gonna get married.

54
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,716
And then I'll never
be able to go anywhere.

55
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,154
<i>It's about time
you got married,</i>

56
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,551
<i>before you turn into a lonesome
and bitter old man.</i>

57
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,031
Yeah, can't you
just see me?

58
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,073
Rushing home to
a hot apartment

59
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,160
to listen to the automatic laundry
and the electric dishwasher

60
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,917
and the garbage disposal
and the nagging wife.

61
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,556
<i>Jeff, wives don't nag
anymore, they discuss.</i>

62
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,235
Is that so?
Is that so?

63
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,915
Well, maybe in the high-rent
district they discuss.

64
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,151
In my neighborhood,
they still nag.

65
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,678
<i>Yeah? Well, you know best.
I'll call you later, Jeff.</i>

66
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,753
Yeah, have some good news
the next time, huh?

67
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,836
Good morning.
I said, "Good morning!"

68
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,718
Oh, good morning.

69
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,519
Say, I wouldn't dig
so deep if I were you.

70
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,315
You're giving them
far too much water.

71
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,598
Why don't
you shut up?

72
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,075
Well!

73
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
I do declare.

74
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,355
New York State sentence for a Peeping Tom is
six months in the workhouse.

75
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,954
Oh, hello, Stella.

76
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,680
And they got no windows
in the workhouse.

77
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,754
You know, in the old days, they used
to put your eyes out with a red-hot poker.

78
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,756
Any of those bikini bombshells
you're always watching worth a red-hot poker?

79
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,920
Oh, dear. We've become
a race of Peeping Toms.

80
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,873
What people ought to do is get outside
their own house and look in for a change.

81
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,280
Yes, sir.

82
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,477
How's that for a bit
of homespun philosophy?

83
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,990
<i>Reader's Digest,</i>
April, 1939.

84
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,237
- Well, I only quote from the best.
- Yeah.

85
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,551
You don't have to take my
temperature this morning.

86
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,394
Quiet. See if you
can break 100.

87
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,870
You know, I should have
been a gypsy fortune-teller

88
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,031
instead of
an insurance-company nurse.

89
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,433
I got a nose for trouble.
Can smell it ten miles away.

90
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,878
You heard of that market crash in '29?
I predicted that.

91
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,111
Just how did you do that, Stella?

92
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,475
Oh, simple.

93
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,076
I was nursing
a director of General Motors.

94
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,279
"Kidney ailment," they said.
"Nerves," I said.

95
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,513
Then I asked myself, "What's General Motors
got to be nervous about?"

96
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,791
"Overproduction," I says.
"Collapse."

97
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,476
When General Motors has to
go to the bathroom 10 times a day,

98
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,075
the whole country's
ready to let go.

99
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,439
You know, Stella,
in economics,

100
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,240
a kidney ailment has no relationship
to the stock market.

101
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,470
None whatsoever.

102
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,597
Crashed,
didn't it?

103
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,718
I can smell trouble right here
in this apartment.

104
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,397
First you smash your leg, then you
get to looking out the window,

105
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,154
see things you shouldn't see.
Trouble.

106
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,398
I can see you
in court now,

107
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,951
surrounded by a bunch of lawyers
in double-breasted suits.

108
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,240
You're pleading. You say, "Judge, it was only
a little bit of innocent fun.

109
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,313
"I love my neighbors,
like a father."

110
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,437
And the judge says,
"Well, congratulations.

111
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,871
"You've just given birth
to three years in Dannemora."

112
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,634
Right now I'd welcome
trouble, you know.

113
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,234
You've got a
hormone deficiency.

114
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,033
How can you tell
from a thermometer?

115
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,032
Those bathing beauties
you've been watching

116
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,591
haven't raised your temperature
one degree in a month.

117
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,794
Here we go.

118
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,359
One more week.

119
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,233
No, I think you're right. I think
there is gonna be trouble around here.

120
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,754
I knew it.

121
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,116
Ooh!

122
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,396
Do you ever
heat that stuff?

123
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,233
Gives your circulation
something to fight.

124
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Oh, I see.

125
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,959
What kind
of trouble?

126
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,793
Lisa Fremont.

127
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,075
You kidding?

128
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,837
She's a beautiful young girl, and you're
a reasonably healthy young man.

129
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,240
She expects me
to marry her.

130
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,356
That's normal.

131
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,635
I don't want to.

132
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
That's abnormal.

133
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,440
I just... I'm not
ready for marriage.

134
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,672
Every man's ready for marriage
when the right girl comes along.

135
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,673
And Lisa Fremont is the right girl
for any man with half a brain

136
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,194
who can get
one eye open.

137
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,873
She's all right.

138
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,872
- What'd you do, have a fight?
- No.

139
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,519
Father loading
up the shotgun?

140
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,636
What?

141
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,910
Please, Stella.

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,514
It's happened
before, you know.

143
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,159
Some of the world's
happiest marriages

144
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,756
have started "under the gun,"
as you might say.

145
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,200
No, she's just not
the girl for me.

146
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,390
Yeah, she's
only perfect.

147
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,515
She's too perfect. She's too talented.
She's too beautiful. She's too sophisticated.

148
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,637
She's too everything
but what I want.

149
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,077
Is what you want something
you can discuss?

150
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,595
What? It's very
simple, Stella.

151
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,754
She belongs to that rarefied atmosphere
of Park Avenue, you know.

152
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,038
Expensive restaurants and
literary cocktail parties.

153
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,157
People with sense belong
wherever they're put.

154
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,153
Can you imagine her traveling
around the world with a camera bum

155
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,311
who never has more than
a week's salary in the bank?

156
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,074
If she was
only ordinary.

157
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,433
You never gonna
get married?

158
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,989
I'll probably get married one
of these days,

159
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,549
but when I do, it's gonna be
to someone who thinks of life

160
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,271
not just as a new dress
and a lobster dinner

161
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,431
or latest scandal.

162
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,513
I need a woman who's
willing to... Hold it.

163
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,480
Who's willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it.

164
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,159
So the honest thing for me to do is
just call the whole thing off.

165
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,232
Let her find
somebody else.

166
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,232
Yeah, I can
hear you now.

167
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,551
"Get out of my life,
you perfectly wonderful woman.

168
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,313
"You're too good for me."

169
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,756
Look, Mr. Jefferies,
I'm not an educated woman,

170
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,599
but I can tell
you one thing.

171
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,037
When a man and a woman see
each other and like each other,

172
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,433
they ought to come together, wham,
like a couple of taxis on Broadway,

173
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,753
and not sit around analyzing each other
like two specimens in a bottle.

174
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,958
There's an intelligent way
to approach marriage.

175
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,156
Intelligence.

176
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,200
Nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence.

177
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,000
Modern marriage.

178
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,640
No, we've progressed
emotionally.

179
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,074
Baloney.

180
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,511
Once it was, "See somebody,
get excited, get married."

181
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,395
Now it's, "Read a lot of books,
fence with a lot of four-syllable words,

182
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,233
"psychoanalyze each other

183
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,976
"until you can't tell
the difference between

184
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,994
"a petting party and
a civil service exam."

185
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,515
People have different
emotional levels...

186
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,480
When I married Myles, we were both
a couple of maladjusted misfits.

187
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,999
We are still maladjusted misfits,
and we have loved every minute of it.

188
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Well, that's
fine, Stella.

189
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,152
Now, would you fix me
a sandwich, please?

190
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,469
Yes, I will.

191
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,439
And I'll spread a little common
sense on the bread.

192
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,354
Lisa's loaded to her fingertips
with love for you.

193
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,478
I got two words of advice
for you. Marry her.

194
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,789
She pay you much?

195
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,916
Oh!

196
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,314
There.

197
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,471
- Here's the key.
- Thank you.

198
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,159
Well, if you want
anything, just ring.

199
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,310
Honey.
Come on.

200
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,480
Got to carry you
over the threshold.

201
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,113
Window shopper.

202
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,118
How's your leg?

203
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,554
It hurts a little.

204
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,634
And your stomach?

205
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,240
Empty as a football.

206
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,832
And your love life?

207
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,513
Not too active.

208
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,237
Anything else
bothering you?

209
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,875
Mmm-hmm.

210
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,113
Who are you?

211
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,640
Reading from top
to bottom, Lisa

212
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,480
Carol

213
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,120
Fremont.

214
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,151
Is this the Lisa Fremont who never wears
the same dress twice?

215
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,675
Only because it's
expected of her.

216
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,510
It's right off the Paris plane.
Do you think it'll sell?

217
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,195
That depends on the quote,
you know. Let's see now.

218
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,036
There's the airplane ticket over and import duties,
hidden taxes, profit markup...

219
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,077
A steal at $1,100.

220
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,516
Eleven hundred?

221
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,035
They ought to list that dress
on the stock exchange.

222
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,158
Why, we sell a dozen
a day in this price range.

223
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,714
Who buys them,
tax collectors?

224
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,271
Even if I had to pay, it would be
worth it. Just for the occasion.

225
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,477
Why, is something big
going on somewhere?

226
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,359
It's going on right here.
It's a big night.

227
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,754
It's just an old run-of-the-mill Wednesday.
The calendar's full of them.

228
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,915
It's opening night of the last depressing week
of L.B. Jefferies in a cast.

229
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,550
Well, I haven't noticed a big demand
for tickets or anything.

230
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,439
That's because I
bought out the house.

231
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,319
You know, this cigarette box has
seen better days.

232
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,952
I picked that up in Shanghai,
which has also seen better days.

233
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,353
It's cracked and you never use it.
It's too ornate.

234
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,320
I'm sending up a plain, flat, silver one
with just your initials engraved.

235
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,040
That's no way to spend your
hard-earned money.

236
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,554
Well, I wanted to.

237
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,396
Oh!

238
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,392
What would you think of starting off
with dinner at '21'?

239
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,040
You have, perhaps, an
ambulance downstairs?

240
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,670
No, better than that.
'21.'

241
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,716
Thank you for waiting, Carl.
The kitchen's right there on the left.

242
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,519
Oh, I'll take the wine.

243
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,038
- Good evening, Mr. Jefferies.
- Carl.

244
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,760
Just put everything in the oven,
Carl, on low.

245
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,473
- Yes, madam.
- Let's open the wine now.

246
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,914
All right.

247
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,120
It's a Montrachet.

248
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,398
A great big glassful.
There's a corkscrew right over there.

249
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,839
Here, I'll do it.

250
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Big enough?

251
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,160
Yeah, they're fine.

252
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,075
I can't think of anything more boring
or tiresome than what you've been through,

253
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,016
- and the last week must be the hardest.
- Let me, sir.

254
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,599
All right.

255
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,798
Yeah, I want to get this thing off
and get moving.

256
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,396
Well, I'm going to make this
a week you'll never forget.

257
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,912
Fine, thanks.

258
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,276
Just a
minute, Carl.

259
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,317
This will take care
of the taxi as well.

260
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,629
Thank you,
Miss Fremont.

261
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,200
Have a pleasant dinner,
Mr. Jefferies.

262
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,590
All right.
Good night.

263
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,080
Good night.

264
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,837
What a day
I've had.

265
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Are you tired?

266
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,030
Not a bit.

267
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,316
I was all morning
in a sales meeting,

268
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,871
then I had to dash to the Waldorf
for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne,

269
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,158
who's just over from Paris
with some spy reports.

270
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,280
And then I had to go to '21' and have lunch
with the <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> people.

271
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,357
And that's when
I ordered dinner.

272
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,194
Then I had two fall showings
20 blocks apart.

273
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,875
Then I had to have a cocktail
with Leland and Slim Hayward.

274
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,679
We're trying to
get his new show.

275
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,797
And then I had to
dash back and change.

276
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,432
Well, now, tell me. Tell me.
Now, what was Mrs. Hayward wearing?

277
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,392
- Oh, she looked wonderfully cool.
- She did.

278
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,359
She had on the most
divine Italian hand-print

279
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,437
- mousseline de soie...
- Oh, Italian?

280
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,552
- Oh, you.
- Italian. Imagine.

281
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,077
To think I planted three nice items
in the columns about you today.

282
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
You did?

283
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,720
You can't buy that
kind of publicity.

284
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,393
I know.

285
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,360
Someday you may want to open up
a studio of your own here.

286
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,116
How would I run it
from, say, Pakistan?

287
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,433
Jeff...

288
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,759
Isn't it time you came home?
You could pick your assignment.

289
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,672
I wish there
was one I wanted.

290
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,989
Make the one
you want.

291
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,918
- You mean leave the magazine?
- Yes.

292
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
For what?

293
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,918
For yourself
and me.

294
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,280
I could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow.

295
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,358
Don't laugh.
I could do it.

296
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,238
That's what I'm afraid of.

297
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,552
Can you see me driving down
to the fashion salon in a jeep,

298
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,758
wearing combat boots
and a three-day beard?

299
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,240
Wouldn't that
make a hit?

300
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,991
I could see you looking very handsome
and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.

301
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,630
Let's stop talking
nonsense, shall we?

302
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,836
Hmm?

303
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,433
Guess I'd better start
setting up for dinner.

304
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:41,319
<i>To see you is to love you</i>

305
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,036
<i>And I see you everywhere</i>

306
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,836
<i>In the sunrise
In the moon glow</i>

307
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,114
<i>Any place I look you're there</i>

308
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,915
<i>To see you is to want you</i>

309
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,078
<i>And I see you all the time</i>

310
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,513
<i>On a sidewalk
In a doorway</i>

311
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,437
<i>On the lonely stairs I climb</i>

312
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,519
<i>Someday let me show you</i>

313
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,352
<i>How happy endings start</i>

314
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,593
<i>You'll find how well
I know you</i>

315
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,030
<i>'Cause to know you at all</i>

316
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,750
<i>Is to know you by heart</i>

317
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,792
<i>To see you is to love you</i>

318
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,474
<i>And you're never out of sight</i>

319
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,115
<i>And I love you
and I'll see you</i>

320
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,552
<i>In the same old dream</i>

321
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,113
<i>Tonight</i>

322
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,479
Miss Lonelyheart.

323
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,394
At least that's something
you'll never have to worry about.

324
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,073
Oh?

325
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,040
You can see my apartment from here,
all the way up on 63rd Street?

326
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,272
No, not exactly, but we have
a little apartment here

327
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,596
that's probably about
as popular as yours.

328
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,276
You remember, of course,
Miss Torso, the ballet dancer?

329
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,552
She's like a queen bee
with her pick of the drones.

330
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,995
I'd say she's doing
a woman's hardest job. Juggling wolves.

331
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,360
Thank you.

332
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,314
Well, she picked the most
prosperous-looking one.

333
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,472
She's not in love with him
or any of them.

334
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,155
Oh, how can you
tell that from here?

335
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,438
You said it resembled
my apartment, didn't you?

336
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,070
I hope they're
cooked this time.

337
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,916
Where's that wonderful
music coming from?

338
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,232
Some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment.

339
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,714
Wow!

340
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,840
He lives alone. Probably
had a very unhappy marriage.

341
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,358
Oh, it's enchanting.

342
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,270
It's almost as if it were being
written especially for us.

343
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,396
Hmm.

344
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,473
No wonder he's having so much
trouble with it.

345
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,840
At least you can't say
the dinner isn't right.

346
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,038
Lisa, it's perfect.

347
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,520
As always.

348
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,798
There can't be that much difference
between people and the way they live.

349
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,349
We all eat, talk,
drink, laugh, wear clothes.

350
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,874
Well, now look...

351
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,794
If you're saying all this because you don't
want to tell me the truth,

352
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,296
because you're hiding something
from me, then maybe I can understand.

353
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,993
I'm not hiding anything.
It's just that...

354
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,434
It doesn't
make sense.

355
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,638
What's so different about it here
from over there or anyplace you go

356
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,315
that one person couldn't live
in both places just as easily?

357
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,056
Some people can.
Now, if you'll just let me...

358
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,391
What is it but traveling from one place
to another, taking pictures?

359
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,676
It's just like being a tourist
on an endless vacation.

360
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,080
Okay.
Now that's your opinion.

361
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,056
You're entitled to it.
Now, let me give you my side.

362
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,117
It's ridiculous to say that
it can only be done

363
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,238
by a special, private little group
of anointed people.

364
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,279
I made a simple statement,
a true statement,

365
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,871
but I can back it up if you'd
just shut up for a minute.

366
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,317
If your opinion is as rude as your manner,
I don't think I care to hear it.

367
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,800
Oh, come on now.
Simmer down.

368
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,191
I can't fit in here.
You can't fit in there.

369
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,512
I mean, according to you, people should be born,
live and die on the same spot!

370
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,795
Shut up!

371
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,950
Did you ever eat
fish heads and rice?

372
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,633
Of course not.

373
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,280
Well, you might have
to if you went with me.

374
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,118
Did you ever try to keep warm in a C-54
at 15,000 feet, 20 degrees below zero?

375
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,352
Oh, I do it all the time. Whenever I have
a few minutes after lunch.

376
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,909
Did you ever get shot at?
Did you ever get run over?

377
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,434
Did you ever get
sandbagged at night

378
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,797
because somebody got unfavorable publicity
from your camera?

379
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,679
Did you ever... Those high heels,
they'll be great in the jungle.

380
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,911
And the nylons and
those six-ounce lingerie.

381
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,559
- Three.
- All right, three.

382
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,077
They'll make a big hit in Finland,
just before you freeze to death.

383
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,710
Well, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to wear the proper clothes.

384
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,995
Yeah, yeah.

385
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,596
Well, try and find a raincoat in Brazil,
even when it isn't raining.

386
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,310
Lisa, in this job
you carry one suitcase.

387
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,915
Your home is
the available transportation.

388
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,151
You don't sleep very much.
You bathe less.

389
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,277
And sometimes
the food that you eat

390
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,115
is made from things that you couldn't
even look at when they're alive.

391
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,989
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive
just to impress me I'm wrong.

392
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,437
Deliberately repulsive?
I'm just trying to make it sound good.

393
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,752
You just have to face it, Lisa,
you're not meant for that kind of a life.

394
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,559
Few people are.

395
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,880
You're too stubborn
to argue with.

396
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,431
I'm not stubborn.
I'm just truthful.

397
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,400
I know, a lesser man would have told me
it was one long holiday,

398
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,190
and I would have been awakened
to a rude disillusionment.

399
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,556
Oh, well now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

400
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,476
If you want to get vicious on this thing,
I'd be very happy to accommodate you.

401
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,759
No, I don't particularly
want that.

402
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,634
So that's it?

403
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,838
You won't stay here,
and I can't go with you.

404
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,037
It would be
the wrong thing.

405
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,240
You don't think either one of us
could ever change?

406
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,516
Right now it
doesn't seem so.

407
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,389
I'm in love with you. I don't care
what you do for a living.

408
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,360
I'd just like to be
part of it somehow.

409
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,559
It's deflating to find out
the only way I can be part of it

410
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,792
is to take out a subscription
to your magazine.

411
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,119
I guess I'm not the girl
I thought I was.

412
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,200
There's nothing wrong
with you, Lisa.

413
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,273
You've got this town
in the palm of your hand.

414
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,913
Not quite, it seems.

415
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,719
Goodbye, Jeff.

416
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,995
You mean good night.

417
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,480
I mean what I said.

418
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,917
Well, Lisa,
couldn't we just...

419
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,594
Uh...

420
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,079
Couldn't we just keep things
status quo?

421
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,513
Without any future?

422
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,990
When am I gonna
see you again?

423
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,512
Not for a long time.

424
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,760
At least

425
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,877
not until tomorrow night.

426
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,118
Don't!

427
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,514
Hey! Rain.

428
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,990
Grab that. The rest of the blanket.
Wait, I'll get the clock.

429
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,400
Oh, no!

430
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,589
Put it in, now.

431
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,919
Pull on it.

432
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,957
Let me do it.

433
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,713
In you go.

434
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,676
No, you can't come in.
It's much too late.

435
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,118
No, no, not now. Get your foot
out of the way. No, I said good night.

436
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,799
What's that supposed to be,
ma'am?

437
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,872
It's called
"Hunger."

438
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,199
You'd think the rain would have
cooled things off.

439
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,496
All it did was
make the heat wet.

440
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,556
That's it.
That's it.

441
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,632
That's stiff one, right there.
Right there.

442
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,155
You know, the insurance company
would be much happier

443
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,278
if you'd sleep in bed at night instead of
in that wheelchair.

444
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,430
How'd you know?

445
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,193
Eyes are
all bloodshot.

446
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,240
Must have been watching out
that window for hours.

447
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,800
Yeah, I was.

448
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,536
What are you gonna do if
one of them catches you?

449
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,074
It depends
which one.

450
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,674
Miss Torso,
for example...

451
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,911
You keep your
mind off her.

452
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,469
She sure is the "Eat,
drink and be merry" girl.

453
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,712
Yeah, she'll wind up fat,
alcoholic and miserable.

454
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,075
Yeah.

455
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,310
Speaking of misery, poor Miss Lonelyheart.
She drank herself to sleep again, alone.

456
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,596
Poor soul.
Oh, well.

457
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,672
Maybe one day she'll
find her happiness.

458
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,594
Yeah, and some man
will lose his.

459
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,276
Isn't there anybody in the neighborhood
who could cast an eye in her direction?

460
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,760
I don't know.

461
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,516
It just might be that the salesman
will be available soon.

462
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,479
Oh, him and his wife
splitting up?

463
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,273
I just can't
figure it.

464
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:18,037
He went out several times last night
in the rain, carrying his sample case.

465
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,360
Well, he's a salesman,
isn't he?

466
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,796
What would he be selling
at 3:00 in the morning?

467
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,314
Flashlights.

468
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,553
Luminous dials for watches.
House numbers that light up.

469
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,838
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

470
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,956
I think he was taking something out
of the apartment.

471
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Uh-huh.

472
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,158
His personal effects.

473
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,595
He's gonna run out
on her, the coward.

474
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,160
Yeah.

475
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,914
Sometimes it's worse
to stay than it is to run.

476
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,836
Yeah, well, it takes a particularly low type
of man to do a thing like that.

477
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,638
How about this morning?
Any further developments?

478
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,751
The shades are all
drawn in the apartment.

479
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,872
- In this heat?
- Yeah.

480
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,792
Well, they're up now.

481
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,000
Get back!
Get back!

482
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,355
Where do you
want me to go?

483
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,776
Come on, get out of sight.
Get out of sight.

484
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,234
What is it?
What's the matter?

485
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,040
That salesman's looking out
of his window. You see?

486
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,077
Get back!
He'll see you.

487
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,595
I'm not shy.
I've been looked at before.

488
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,637
That's no ordinary look.

489
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,033
That's the kind
of look a man gives

490
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,272
when he's afraid somebody
might be watching him.

491
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,429
Get away from there. Get away from there.
He'll be after you.

492
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,716
Go on, into the house.
Into the house.

493
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,319
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies.
See you tomorrow.

494
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,629
Uh-huh.

495
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,356
And don't sleep in
that chair again.

496
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
Uh-huh.

497
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,709
"Uh-huh. Uh-huh."

498
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,952
Great conversationalist.

499
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,680
Stella.

500
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,635
Take those binoculars out of the case
and bring them here, will you?

501
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,554
Trouble.
I can smell it.

502
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,674
I'll be glad when they crack that cast,
and I can get out of here.

503
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,910
Uh-huh.

504
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,512
How far does a girl have
to go before you'll notice her?

505
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,640
Well, if she's pretty enough,
she doesn't have to go anywhere.

506
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,951
She just has to "be."

507
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,076
Well, ain't I?

508
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,638
Pay attention to me.

509
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,796
I'm not exactly on
the other side of the room.

510
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,833
Your mind is...

511
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,594
And when I want a man,
I want all of him.

512
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,679
Don't you ever
have any problems?

513
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,399
I have one now.

514
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,195
So do I.

515
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,638
Tell me about it.

516
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,115
Why...

517
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,038
Why would a man leave his apartment three times
on a rainy night with a suitcase,

518
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,874
and come back
three times?

519
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,792
He likes the way his
wife welcomes him home.

520
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,792
No, no. No, no.

521
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,873
No, no. Not this
salesman's wife.

522
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,952
And why didn't he
go to work today?

523
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,350
Homework. It's
more interesting.

524
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,556
What's interesting
about a butcher knife

525
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,030
and a small saw

526
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,555
wrapped in newspaper?
Hmm?

527
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,235
Nothing,
thank heaven.

528
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,199
Why hasn't he been
in his wife's bedroom all day?

529
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,437
I wouldn't dare
answer that.

530
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,273
Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.
There's something terribly wrong.

531
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,436
And I'm afraid
it's with me.

532
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,520
What do you think?

533
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,469
Something too
frightful to utter.

534
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:53,319
He went out a few minutes ago
in his undershirt, hasn't come back yet.

535
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,673
That'd be a terrible job
to tackle.

536
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,712
Just how would you start
to cut up a human body?

537
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,399
Jeff, I'll be honest with you.
You're beginning to scare me a little.

538
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,176
Jeff, did you hear what I said?
You're beginning to scare...

539
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,192
Shh! Shh!

540
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,999
He's coming back!

541
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,758
Jeff, if you could
only see yourself!

542
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,880
What's the matter?

543
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,576
Sitting around looking out of the window
to kill time is one thing,

544
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,719
but doing it the way you are,
with binoculars and wild opinions

545
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,395
about every little thing you see,
is diseased!

546
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,154
What, do you think I
consider it recreation?

547
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,993
I don't know what
you consider it,

548
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,151
but if you don't stop it,
I'm getting out of here.

549
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,310
What's the...

550
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,794
What is it you're
looking for?

551
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,736
I just want to find out what's the matter
with the salesman's wife, that's all.

552
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,433
Does that make me
sound like a madman?

553
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,416
What makes you think there's something
the matter with her?

554
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,990
A lot of things. She's an invalid.
She demands constant care.

555
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,353
Yet neither the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day. Why?

556
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,440
Maybe she died.

557
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,194
Where's the doctor?
Where's the undertaker?

558
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,159
She could be sleeping,
under sedatives.

559
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,074
He's in there now.
There's nothing to see.

560
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,675
There is something...
I've seen it through that window.

561
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,594
I've seen bickering
and family quarrels

562
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,912
and mysterious trips at night
and knives and saws and ropes.

563
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,936
And now, since last evening,
not a sign of the wife.

564
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,456
All right. Now you tell me
where she is.

565
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,400
- I don't know.
- What's she doing? Where is she?

566
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,439
Maybe he's leaving his wife.
I don't know. I don't care!

567
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,638
Lots of people have knives and saws
and ropes around their houses.

568
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,679
And lots of men don't speak
to their wives all day.

569
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,355
Lots of wives nag and men hate them
and trouble starts,

570
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,559
but very, very few of them end up in murder,
if that's what you're thinking.

571
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,096
It's pretty hard for you to keep away
from that word, isn't it?

572
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,760
- You could see all that he did, couldn't you?
- Of course...

573
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,473
You could see
because the shades were up

574
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,871
and he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard.

575
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,376
I've seen him in the backyard,
fixing the flowers...

576
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,393
Oh, Jeff, do you think a murderer
would let you see all that?

577
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,200
That he wouldn't pull the shades down
and hide behind them?

578
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,496
Just where he's being clever.
He's being nonchalant about it.

579
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,318
And that's where you're not
being clever.

580
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,235
A murderer would never parade his crime
in front of an open window.

581
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,436
Why not?

582
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,520
Why, for all you know,

583
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,752
there's probably something a lot more
sinister going on behind those windows.

584
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,069
Where?

585
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,276
Oh!

586
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,234
No comment.

587
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,390
Let's start from
the beginning again, Jeff.

588
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,877
Tell me everything
you saw

589
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,759
and what you think
it means.

590
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,240
Yeah?

591
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,456
<i>The name
on the second floor</i>

592
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,996
<i>rear mail box reads,
"Mr. and Mrs. Lars."</i>

593
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,436
<i>That's L-A-R-S.</i>

594
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,477
<i>Lars Thorwald.</i>

595
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,233
What's the number of
the apartment house?

596
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,880
<i>125 West
9th Street.</i>

597
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,480
Thank you, dear.

598
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,831
<i>Okay, chief.
What's my next assignment?</i>

599
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,920
Just go home.

600
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,719
<i>All right,
but what's he doing now?</i>

601
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,237
He's just sitting
in the living room in the dark.

602
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,600
Hasn't gone
near the bedroom.

603
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,353
Now you go home
and get some sleep.

604
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,397
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

605
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,616
<i>All right.
What's it all about, Jeff?</i>

606
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,997
Now look, Doyle, it's just something
I can't tell you over the telephone.

607
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,958
You have to be here
and see the whole setup.

608
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,040
<i>Important, huh?</i>

609
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,696
Well, it's probably
nothing important at all.

610
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,791
It's just a little neighborhood murder,
that's all.

611
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,920
<i>Did you say "murder,"
Jeff?</i>

612
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,656
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I did say "murder."

613
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,034
<i>Oh, come now.</i>

614
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,477
My only thought was throwing
a little business your way, that's all.

615
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,520
I figured a good detective would jump
at the chance of something to detect.

616
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,199
<i>- I'm not working.</i>
- What?

617
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,953
<i>This happens to
be my day off.</i>

618
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,999
Well, I usually took
my best pictures on my day off.

619
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,156
<i>I'll drop by.</i>

620
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,875
Okay, Doyle. All right.
As soon as you can.

621
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,109
Bless your heart, Stella.
Gee whiz, look at this.

622
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,157
I can't tell you
what a welcome sight this is.

623
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,232
No wonder your husband
still loves you.

624
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,913
- The police.
- What?

625
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You called the police.

626
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,992
Well, not exactly.

627
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,790
Not an official call.
It's just an old friend of mine.

628
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,918
An old, ornery
friend of mine.

629
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,834
Just where do you
suppose he cut her up?

630
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,995
Of course.
The bathtub.

631
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,920
That's the only place where he could
have washed away the blood.

632
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,680
He better get that trunk out
of there before it starts to leak.

633
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,634
Harry?

634
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,037
Look, look,
Mr. Jefferies.

635
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,000
I thought Doyle would be here
by the time the trunk left,

636
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,549
or I'd have called the police.
Now we're gonna lose it.

637
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,296
- Hold everything.
- Don't do anything foolish.

638
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,216
I'm just gonna get the name off
that freight truck.

639
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,471
I'll keep an eye
on the alley.

640
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,633
Long distance.

641
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,396
You didn't see the killing or the body.
How do you know there was a murder?

642
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,518
Because everything this fellow's done
has been suspicious.

643
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,355
Trips at night in the rain, and knives
and saws and trunks with rope

644
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,671
and now this wife
that isn't there anymore.

645
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,551
I admit it all has a mysterious sound.
It could be any number of things.

646
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,994
Murder's the
least plausible.

647
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,470
Doyle, don't tell me
he's an unemployed magician,

648
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,598
amusing the neighborhood with his sleight
of hand. Don't tell me that.

649
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,070
It's too obvious and stupid
a way to commit murder.

650
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,799
In full view
of 50 windows?

651
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,136
Then sit over there
smoking a cigar,

652
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,816
waiting for the police
to come and pick him up?

653
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,230
All right, Officer, do your duty.
Go over and pick him up.

654
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,592
Jeff, you've got a lot to learn
about homicide.

655
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,876
Why, morons have
committed murder so shrewdly,

656
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,237
it's taken a hundred trained police minds
to catch them.

657
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,915
That salesman wouldn't just knock
his wife off after dinner

658
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,515
and toss her in the trunk
and put her in storage.

659
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,920
I'll bet it's been done.

660
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,238
Most everything's
been done, under panic.

661
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,391
This is
a thousand-to-one shot.

662
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,791
He's still sitting around the apartment.
That man's not panicked.

663
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,951
You think
I made all this up?

664
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,952
Well, I think
you saw something.

665
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,680
There's probably a very simple
explanation for that.

666
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,274
For instance?

667
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,919
Wife took a trip.

668
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,992
His wife was sick
in bed.

669
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,233
Yeah, so you told me.

670
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,309
Well, Jeff,
I've got to run along.

671
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:09,794
I won't report this to the department.
Let me poke into it a little on my own.

672
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,634
No sense in your getting a lot of
ridiculous publicity.

673
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,074
Thank you.

674
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,239
We know the wife is gone,
so I'll see if I can find out where.

675
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,549
Do that.

676
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,275
You had any
headaches lately?

677
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,714
Not until you
showed up.

678
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,793
It'll wear off,
along with the hallucinations.

679
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,439
See you around.

680
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,320
Get along.

681
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,080
He has
a six months' lease.

682
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,119
Used up a little more than five
and a half months of it.

683
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,635
He's quiet, drinks,
but not to drunkenness.

684
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,633
Pays his bills promptly with money earned
as a costume jewelry salesman.

685
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,040
Wholesale.

686
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,438
Kept to himself. None of his neighbors
got close to him or his wife.

687
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,416
Yeah, well, I think they missed
their chance with her.

688
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,456
She never left
the apartment...

689
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,376
- Where is she? The icebox?
- ...until yesterday morning.

690
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,710
- What time?
- 6:00 a.m.

691
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,154
6:00 a.m.

692
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,999
I think that's about
the time I fell asleep.

693
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,309
Too bad.

694
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,475
Thorwalds were leaving their apartment
at just that time.

695
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,512
Feel a little foolish?

696
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,474
No, not yet.

697
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,918
How's your wife?

698
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,150
Oh, she's fine.

699
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,877
Who said
they left then?

700
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,520
Who left where?

701
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,671
The Thorwalds,
at 6:00 in the morning.

702
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,434
Oh, the building superintendent
and two tenants.

703
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,558
Flat statements, no hesitation.
They jived with the letter.

704
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,075
Thorwalds were on their way
to the railroad station.

705
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,676
Well, now, Tom, how could anybody
possibly guess that?

706
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,919
What, did they have signs on their luggage,
saying, "Grand Central or bust?"

707
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,754
The superintendent met Thorwald
on his way back.

708
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,958
Thorwald told him that he'd put
his wife on a train to the country.

709
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,192
I see. I'd say this is a pretty
convenient guy, this superintendent.

710
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,193
Have you checked his bank
statements lately?

711
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,470
Huh?

712
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,075
Well, what good's
his information?

713
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,550
It's a secondhand version
of an unsupported story

714
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,393
by the murderer
himself, Thorwald.

715
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,030
Now did anybody actually see
the wife get on the train?

716
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,040
I hate to
remind you,

717
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,834
but this all started because you said
she was murdered.

718
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,078
Now, did anyone, including you,
actually see her murdered?

719
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,992
What are you doing?

720
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:16,120
Are you interested in solving this case
or in making me look foolish?

721
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,317
Well, if possible, both.

722
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,914
Well, then, do a
good job of it.

723
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,878
Go over there
and search Thorwald's apartment.

724
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,838
It must be knee-deep
in evidence.

725
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,354
I can't do that.

726
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,776
Well, no, I don't mean right now,
but when he goes out for a drink,

727
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,096
or a paper, or something.
What he doesn't know won't hurt him.

728
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,510
I can't do that,
even if he isn't there.

729
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,356
What's he... Does he have a courtesy card
from the police department, or something?

730
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,272
Now don't get me mad.

731
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,598
Not even a detective can walk
into an apartment and search it.

732
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,752
If I were caught in there,
they'd have my badge within 10 minutes.

733
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,355
All right. Make sure
you don't get caught, that's all.

734
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,671
What? If you find something,
you've got a murderer,

735
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,936
and they don't care anything
about a couple of house rules.

736
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,031
If you don't find anything,
the fellow's clear.

737
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,512
At the risk of sounding stuffy, I'd like
to remind you of the Constitution

738
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,474
and the phrase, "Search warrant issued
by a judge

739
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,637
"who knows his Bill
of Rights verbatim."

740
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,279
He must ask for evidence.

741
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,714
Give him evidence.

742
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,512
Yeah, I can
hear myself.

743
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,640
"Your Honor, I have a friend
who's an amateur sleuth.

744
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,395
"Well, the other night after having
a heavy dinner, he..."

745
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,915
He'd throw the New York State
penal code right in my face.

746
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,071
And there's
six volumes.

747
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,520
You know, by tomorrow morning
there may not be any evidence left

748
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,717
over in that apartment.
You know that.

749
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,110
It's a detective's
nightmare.

750
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,910
What do you need
before you can search?

751
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,200
Tell me. Now,
what do you need?

752
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,795
Bloody footsteps leading up
to the door?

753
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,510
One thing I don't need is heckling.
You called me and asked for help.

754
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,155
Now you're behaving
like a taxpayer.

755
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,912
How did we ever stand
each other in that plane

756
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,992
for three years
during the war?

757
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,320
I guess I'll go over to the railroad station
and check on Thorwald's story.

758
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,073
Oh, forget
about the story.

759
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,834
Find the trunk.
Mrs. Thorwald's in it.

760
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,435
Oh, I almost forgot.

761
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,877
There was a postcard in
Thorwald's mailbox. It was

762
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,159
mailed 3:30 yesterday
afternoon from Merritsville.

763
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,311
That's 80 miles
north of here.

764
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,189
Message went, "Arrived okay.
Already feeling better.

765
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,714
"Love, Anna."

766
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,550
Oh...

767
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,040
Is that...

768
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,469
Anna... Is that
who I think it is?

769
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,200
Mrs. Thorwald.

770
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,990
Oh, so anything
you need, Jeff?

771
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,915
You might send me
a good detective.

772
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,879
<i>Many dreams ago</i>

773
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,352
<i>I dreamed many dreams</i>

774
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:05,559
<i>Waiting for my true love</i>

775
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,953
<i>To appear</i>

776
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,598
<i>Though each night it seems</i>

777
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:22,234
<i>Someone filled my dreams</i>

778
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,070
<i>Still the face</i>

779
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:30,554
<i>That I kissed wasn't clear</i>

780
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:39,111
<i>So I let my heart dance</i>

781
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:44,555
<i>To many sweet refrains</i>

782
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:49,755
<i>But now just one song</i>

783
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,920
<i>And just one dream remains</i>

784
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,114
<i>That one song is you</i>

785
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,992
<i>And at last I know</i>

786
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:10,916
<i>You're the one I dreamed of</i>

787
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:15,439
<i>Many dreams ago</i>

788
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,993
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello, Miss Doyle?

789
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,080
<i>Yes?</i>

790
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,680
This is Jeff again.
Has Tom come in yet?

791
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,800
<i>Not yet, Jeff.</i>

792
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,832
You mean you haven't
even heard from him?

793
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,391
<i>Not a word. Is it something
really important, Jeff?</i>

794
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,153
Yeah, I'm afraid
it is, Tess.

795
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,232
<i>I'll have him call the moment
I hear from him.</i>

796
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,720
No, no, don't
bother to do that.

797
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,395
Just have him get over here
as soon as he can.

798
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,153
Looks like Thorwald's
pulling out tonight.

799
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,240
<i>Who's Thorwald?</i>

800
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,430
He'll know,
he'll know.

801
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,240
And Thorwald's a man,
Tess, don't worry.

802
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,676
<i>- Good night, you idiot.</i>
- Good night.

803
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,272
Long distance again.

804
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,156
There's somebody
at the door.

805
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,511
- Hi.
- Hello.

806
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,040
Hello.

807
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,697
What'd you
do to your hair?

808
01:06:23,721 --> 01:06:25,536
- Oh, well, I just sort of...
- Take a look at Thorwald.

809
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:29,031
He's getting ready to pull out
for good. Look at him.

810
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,993
He doesn't seem
to be in any hurry.

811
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,549
He's been laying out all his things
on one of the beds.

812
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,911
Shirts, suits,
coats, socks.

813
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,117
Even his wife's...
That alligator handbag

814
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,550
- his wife had on the bedpost.
- What about it?

815
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,360
He had it hidden in the dresser.
At least, it was there.

816
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,394
He took it out, went to the telephone
and made a long-distance call.

817
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,154
He had his wife's jewelry
in the handbag.

818
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,310
Seemed worried
about it.

819
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,153
Asked somebody's advice over
the telephone.

820
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,873
Someone not his wife.

821
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,156
Well, I never saw
him ask her for advice.

822
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,075
She volunteered plenty, but I never
saw him ask her for any.

823
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,840
I wonder where
he's going.

824
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,240
I don't know.

825
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,719
Suppose he doesn't come
back again?

826
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,395
He'll be back.
His things are still there.

827
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,600
Well, I guess it's safe
to put on some lights now.

828
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,120
No, not yet!

829
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:38,558
Okay, you can turn it on now.
He must have gone someplace to the right.

830
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,991
All day long, I've been trying
to keep my mind on my work.

831
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,713
Thinking about Thorwald?

832
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,996
And you and your friend,
Doyle.

833
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,472
Did you hear from him again,
since he left?

834
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,560
Not a word.

835
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,235
He said he was gonna check
the railroad station and the trunk.

836
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,198
He must be
still at it.

837
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,837
Something on
your mind?

838
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,079
It doesn't make
sense to me.

839
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,594
What doesn't?

840
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,470
Women aren't that
unpredictable.

841
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,996
Mmm.

842
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,198
Well, I can't guess
what you're thinking.

843
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,670
A woman has a
favorite handbag

844
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,879
and it always hangs on her bedpost,
where she can get at it easily.

845
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,954
And then, all of a sudden, she goes away
on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?

846
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,776
Because she didn't know
she was going on a trip.

847
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,856
And where she's going,
she wouldn't need the handbag.

848
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,759
Yes, but only her husband
would know that.

849
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,269
And that jewelry.

850
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,158
Women don't keep their
jewelry in a purse

851
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,709
getting all twisted and
scratched and tangled up.

852
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,456
Well, do they hide it
in their husband's clothes?

853
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,073
They do not.

854
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,880
And they don't leave it
behind, either.

855
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,317
Why, a woman going anywhere
but the hospital

856
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,393
would always take makeup,
perfume and jewelry.

857
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,878
Put that over there.
That's inside stuff, huh?

858
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,599
It's basic equipment.

859
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,559
And you don't leave it behind
in your husband's drawer

860
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,074
in your favorite handbag.

861
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,470
Well, I'm with you, sweetie.
I'm with you.

862
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,517
Tom Doyle has a pat answer
for that, though.

863
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,557
That Mrs. Thorwald
left at 6:00 a.m.

864
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,710
yesterday with
her husband?

865
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,473
According to
those witnesses.

866
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,791
Well, I have a pat
rebuttal for Mr. Doyle.

867
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,715
That couldn't have been Mrs. Thorwald,
or I don't know women.

868
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,837
What about
the witnesses?

869
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,191
We'll agree they
saw a woman,

870
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,996
but she was not
Mrs. Thorwald.

871
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,636
That is, not yet.

872
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,760
Is that so?

873
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,320
Come here.

874
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,151
I'd like to see your friend's face
when we tell him.

875
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,471
He doesn't sound like
much of a detective.

876
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,997
Oh, don't be too hard on him.
He's a steady worker.

877
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,597
I sure wish
he'd show up.

878
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,275
Don't rush him.
We have all night.

879
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,877
- We have all what?
- Night.

880
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,591
I'm going to
stay with you.

881
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,837
Well, you'll have to clear that
with my landlord.

882
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,951
I have the whole
weekend off.

883
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,833
That's very nice,
but I just have one bed.

884
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,150
If you say anything else,
I'll stay tomorrow night, too.

885
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,118
I won't be able to
give you any pajamas.

886
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,678
You said I'll have to
live out of one suitcase.

887
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,077
I'll bet yours
isn't this small.

888
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,793
This is a suitcase?

889
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,793
Well, a Mark Cross
overnight case, anyway.

890
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,398
Compact, but
ample enough.

891
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,711
Looks like you
packed in a hurry.

892
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,315
Look at this.
Isn't that amazing?

893
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,799
I'll trade you...

894
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,952
My feminine intuition
for a bed for the night.

895
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,111
I'll go along
with that.

896
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,037
There's that
song again.

897
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:14,356
Where does a man get inspiration
to write a song like that?

898
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,512
Well, he gets it from the landlady
once a month.

899
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,557
It's utterly beautiful.

900
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,073
I wish I could
be creative.

901
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,879
Oh, sweetie,
you are.

902
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,271
You have a great talent
for creating difficult situations.

903
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,680
- I do?
- Sure.

904
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,116
Like staying here
all night uninvited.

905
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,557
Surprise is the most important
element of attack.

906
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,758
And besides, you're not up
on your private eye literature.

907
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,960
When they're in trouble,
it's always their Girl Friday

908
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,394
who gets them
out of it.

909
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,631
Is she the girl that saves them
from the clutches

910
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,200
of the seductive showgirls

911
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,476
and the over-passionate
daughters of the rich?

912
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,631
- The same.
- That's the one, huh?

913
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,475
It's funny. He never ends up
marrying her, does he?

914
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,710
That's strange.

915
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,950
Weird.

916
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,276
Why don't I slip into something
more comfortable?

917
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,079
By all means.

918
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,994
I mean, like the kitchen
and make us some coffee.

919
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,549
Oh, and some
brandy, too, huh?

920
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,674
Harry.

921
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,480
- Jeff.
- Hi.

922
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,713
What else have you got
on this man Thorwald?

923
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,231
Well, enough to scare me you wouldn't
show up in time and we'd lose him.

924
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,336
Think he's getting
out of here?

925
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,840
Look, he's got
everything he owns

926
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,470
laid out over there in the bedroom,
waiting to be packed.

927
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,990
I'm just warming some brandy.
Mr. Doyle, I presume?

928
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,757
Tom, this is
Miss Lisa Fremont.

929
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:49,840
How do you do?

930
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,876
We think Thorwald's guilty.

931
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,513
Careful, Tom.

932
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,096
- Hello.
<i>- Lieutenant Doyle.</i>

933
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,476
Yeah, he's right here.
For you.

934
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,397
- Hello.
<i>- Lieutenant Doyle, sir?</i>

935
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,800
Speaking.

936
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,160
Yeah.

937
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,554
All right.

938
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,111
I see. Thank you.
Goodbye.

939
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,791
Coffee will be
ready soon.

940
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,634
Jeff, aren't you going to tell him
about the jewelry?

941
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,756
Jewelry?

942
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,197
He's got his wife's jewelry hidden
in his clothes in the bedroom over there.

943
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,496
You sure it belonged
to his wife?

944
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,557
It was
in her favorite handbag.

945
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,314
Mr. Doyle, that can only lead
to one conclusion.

946
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,436
Namely?

947
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:44,480
That it was not Mrs. Thorwald that left
with him yesterday morning.

948
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,994
You figured
that out, eh?

949
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,515
Well, it's simply that women don't leave
their jewelry behind

950
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,592
when they go
on a trip.

951
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,920
Come on, come on,
Tom.

952
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,596
Now you don't really need any
of this information, do you?

953
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,756
As a matter
of fact, I don't.

954
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,917
Lars Thorwald is no more
a murderer than I am.

955
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,576
You mean to say you can explain everything
that's gone on over there,

956
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,875
and is still going on?

957
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,838
No, neither can you.

958
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,913
That's a secret, private world
you're looking into out there.

959
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,056
People do a lot of things in private
they couldn't possibly explain in public.

960
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,958
Like disposing
of their wives?

961
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,856
You get that idea out of your mind.
It'll only lead in the wrong direction.

962
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,315
What about the knife
and the saw?

963
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,993
Did you ever
own a saw?

964
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,754
Well, at home
in the garage I had...

965
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,116
How many people
did you cut up with it?

966
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:47,638
Or with the couple of hundred knives
you've probably owned in your lifetime?

967
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,033
Well, your logic is backward.

968
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:54,000
You can't ignore the wife disappearing
and the trunk and the jewelry.

969
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,834
I checked the railroad station.
He bought a ticket.

970
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,877
Ten minutes later,
he put his wife on a train.

971
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,078
Destination, Merritsville.
The witnesses are that deep.

972
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,238
That might have been a woman,
but it couldn't have been Mrs. Thorwald.

973
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,840
- That jewelry...
- Look, Miss Fremont.

974
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,719
That feminine intuition
stuff sells magazines.

975
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,759
But in real life,
it's still a fairy tale.

976
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,616
I don't know how many
wasted years I've spent

977
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,235
tracking down leads based
on female intuition.

978
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,960
All right. I take it you didn't
find the trunk,

979
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:23,511
and all this is from an old speech you
once made at the Policemen's Ball.

980
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,109
I found the trunk
a half-hour after I left here.

981
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,876
I suppose it's normal for a man
to tie up a trunk with heavy rope?

982
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,952
Well, if the lock
is broken, yes.

983
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,158
And what did you find inside the trunk?
A surly note to me?

984
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,357
Mrs. Thorwald's clothes.

985
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,831
Clean, well packed.
Not stylish, but presentable.

986
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,752
Didn't you take them
off to the crime lab?

987
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,719
I sent them on their
merry and legal way.

988
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,599
Why, when a woman is taking
a simple, short trip,

989
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,592
does she take everything
she owns?

990
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,390
Let's let the female psychology
department handle that one.

991
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,829
I would say it looked
as if she wasn't coming back.

992
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,593
That's what's known
as a family problem.

993
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,514
And if she wasn't coming back,
why didn't he tell his landlord?

994
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:07,391
I'll tell you why he didn't tell his landlord.
Because he was hiding something.

995
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,989
Do you tell your
landlord everything?

996
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,799
I told you to
be careful, Tom.

997
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:17,080
Look, if I'd have been careful piloting
that reconnaissance plane during the war,

998
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,696
you wouldn't have had the chance
to take the pictures

999
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:23,112
that won you a medal, and a good job,
and fame and money.

1000
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,037
What do you say we all sit down
and have a nice, friendly drink, too? Hmm?

1001
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,712
Forget all about this.

1002
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,996
We can tell lies about the good
old days during the war.

1003
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,031
You mean you're through
with the case?

1004
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,954
There is no case to be through with,
Miss Fremont.

1005
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,918
How about that drink?

1006
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,637
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

1007
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,237
Well, I think I better get home
and get some sleep.

1008
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,274
Cheers.

1009
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,791
Not much of a snifter.

1010
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,200
Oh, Jeff, if you
need any more help...

1011
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,751
Consult the Yellow Pages
in your telephone directory.

1012
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,114
Oh, I love funny
exiting lines.

1013
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,873
Who was that trunk
addressed to?

1014
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,394
Mrs. Anna Thorwald.

1015
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,040
Well, then let's wait
and find out who picks it up.

1016
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,555
Oh, that telephone call.
I gave them your number.

1017
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,960
I hope you don't mind.

1018
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,554
Depends on
who they were.

1019
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,199
The police at
Merritsville.

1020
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,476
They reported the trunk was
just picked up

1021
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,517
by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.

1022
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,830
Don't stay up too late.

1023
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,072
- Look.
- What?

1024
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,640
Yeah, he's kind
of young, isn't he?

1025
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,273
What are you doing?

1026
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:48,197
You know, much as I hate to give
Thomas J. Doyle too much credit,

1027
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,596
he might have gotten a hold
of something when he said

1028
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,832
that was pretty private
stuff going on out there.

1029
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,755
I wonder if it's ethical to watch a man
with binoculars and a long-focus lens.

1030
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,513
Do you... Do you
suppose it's ethical,

1031
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,798
even if you prove that he didn't
commit a crime?

1032
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:13,034
I'm not much on
rear-window ethics.

1033
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,776
Of course, they can
do the same thing to me.

1034
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,271
Watch me like a bug under
a glass, if they want to.

1035
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,876
Jeff, you know, if someone came in here,
they wouldn't believe what they'd see.

1036
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,960
What?

1037
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,235
You and me
with long faces.

1038
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,837
Plunged into despair because we find out
a man didn't kill his wife.

1039
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,391
We're two of the most frightening
ghouls I've ever known.

1040
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:37,430
You'd think we could be a little bit happy
that the poor woman is alive and well.

1041
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:43,317
Whatever happened to that old saying,
"Love thy neighbor"?

1042
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,357
You know, I think I'll start reviving
that tomorrow.

1043
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,995
Yeah, I'll begin
with Miss Torso.

1044
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:56,720
Not if I have to move
into an apartment across the way

1045
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,518
and do the <i>Dance of the Seven Veils</i>
every hour.

1046
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,472
Show's over for tonight.

1047
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,910
Preview of coming
attractions.

1048
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,034
Did Mr. Doyle think
I stole this case?

1049
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,399
No, Lisa, I don't
think he did.

1050
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,312
What do you think?

1051
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,400
Well...

1052
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,751
I will rephrase
the question.

1053
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,069
Thank you.

1054
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,753
Do you like it?

1055
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,914
Yes, I like it.

1056
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,956
Well...

1057
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,319
What's the matter?

1058
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,117
- Somebody's hurt?
- It's the dog.

1059
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,669
Something's happened
to the dog.

1060
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,672
What's the trouble?
Somebody fall out a window?

1061
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,630
See, it's a dog
down there.

1062
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,954
It's dead.

1063
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,359
It's been strangled.
The neck is broken.

1064
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,998
Which one of
you did it?

1065
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,515
Which one of you
killed my dog?

1066
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,999
You don't know the meaning
of the word "Neighbors."

1067
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:40,036
Neighbors like each other,
speak to each other,

1068
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,470
care if anybody
lives or dies.

1069
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,953
But none of you do!

1070
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,349
But I couldn't imagine
any of you being so low

1071
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,831
that you'd kill a little
helpless, friendly dog.

1072
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,880
The only thing in this whole neighborhood
who liked anybody.

1073
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,914
Did you kill him
because he liked you?

1074
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,151
Just because
he liked you?

1075
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,633
Let's go inside.

1076
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,713
Come on. Let's go back in.
It's only a dog.

1077
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,074
You know, for a minute, that Tom Doyle
almost had me convinced I was wrong.

1078
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,072
- But you're not?
- Look.

1079
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:48,359
In the whole courtyard, only one person
didn't come to the window.

1080
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,669
Look.

1081
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,431
Why would Thorwald want to kill
a little dog?

1082
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,312
Because it
knew too much?

1083
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:13,398
You think this is worth
waiting all day to see?

1084
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,434
Is he
cleaning house?

1085
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,115
He's washing down
the bathroom walls.

1086
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,236
Hmm.

1087
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,437
Must have splattered
a lot.

1088
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,720
Well, why not?
That's what we're all thinking.

1089
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,680
He killed her in there, he has to clean up
those stains before he leaves.

1090
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,360
Oh, Stella, your
choice of words.

1091
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:34,871
Nobody ever invented
a polite word for a killing yet.

1092
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,955
Lisa? Lisa, back there, on that shelf,
there's a little yellow box. You see it?

1093
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,793
- Top one?
- Right on top, yeah.

1094
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,395
Bring it. And bring
me the viewer there.

1095
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,839
I just got a...

1096
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:54,314
Now, these are
about two weeks old.

1097
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:58,076
I hope I took something else besides
eg art. Now which one...

1098
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,516
- What are you looking for?
- Here.

1099
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,198
There's something, and if I'm right,
I think I've solved a murder.

1100
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,078
- Mrs. Thorwald?
- No.

1101
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,277
No, the dog.

1102
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,635
Uh-huh.

1103
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:14,713
I think I know
why Thorwald killed that dog.

1104
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:18,392
Here, now you take a look.
Tell me what you see.

1105
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,359
Now take it down.

1106
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,470
Now look again.
Now take it down. You see?

1107
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,160
But it's just a picture
of the backyard, that's all.

1108
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:32,234
One important change.
One important change.

1109
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,278
Those flowers in Thorwald's pet
flower bed.

1110
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,271
You mean where the dog
was sniffing around?

1111
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,831
Where the dog was digging.
Now look at those flowers.

1112
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,995
Look, right? Those two yellow
zinnias on this end

1113
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,912
aren't as tall
as they were.

1114
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,311
Now, since when do flowers
grow shorter in two weeks?

1115
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,880
There's something
buried there.

1116
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,679
Mrs. Thorwald.

1117
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:59,557
You haven't spent much time
around cemeteries, have you?

1118
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:02,678
Mr. Thorwald could scarcely put
his wife's body

1119
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,719
in a plot of ground
about one foot square.

1120
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,634
Unless, of course, he put her
in standing on end,

1121
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,440
and then he wouldn't
need a knife and saw.

1122
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:15,196
No, my idea is she's
scattered all over town.

1123
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,556
- Leg in the East River...
- Oh, Stella, please!

1124
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,136
No, no, no. There's
something in there.

1125
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,720
Those flowers have been taken out
and put back in.

1126
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,672
- Maybe it's the knife and saw.
- Yeah.

1127
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,836
Call Lieutenant Doyle.

1128
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,070
No, let's wait.

1129
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:29,915
Let's wait till it gets a little darker,
and I'll go over there and dig them up.

1130
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,994
You'll go? You won't dig anything up
and get your neck broken.

1131
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,279
No, no, we've...

1132
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:40,117
We're not gonna call Doyle until
I can produce Mrs. Thorwald's body.

1133
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,034
What we've got to do is find
a way to get into that apartment.

1134
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,600
He's packing.

1135
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:46,956
Uh-oh.

1136
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,350
Here, get me
a pencil.

1137
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,557
Stella, get me some note paper.
It's up here someplace.

1138
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,199
There it is.

1139
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,674
You did it, Thorwald.
You did it.

1140
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,800
Look out, Lisa.
He's coming.

1141
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,997
You never should have let her do it.
If he ever...

1142
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,355
Look. Look. Look.

1143
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,715
Well, thank heaven
that's over.

1144
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:49,976
All right if I
have a drink?

1145
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,593
Sure, go ahead.

1146
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:04,074
There's no doubt about it. He's leaving.
It's just a question of when.

1147
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,800
Mind if I use that
portable keyhole?

1148
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:12,000
Go ahead, just as long as you tell me
what you're looking at.

1149
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I wonder...

1150
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,196
Wonder what?

1151
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,158
Miss Lonelyheart's
just laid out something

1152
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,880
that looks like rhodium
tri-eckonal capsules.

1153
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,235
You can tell
from here?

1154
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,279
I've handled enough of those red pills
to put everybody in Hackensack

1155
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:30,675
to sleep for the winter.

1156
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,433
Well, does she have
enough of them to...

1157
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,512
No. It will make
the rest easy to...

1158
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,999
Wasn't that close?

1159
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,758
What was his reaction. I mean,
when he looked at the note?

1160
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:44,754
Well, it wasn't the kind of an expression
that would get him a quick loan at the bank.

1161
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,672
Jeff, the handbag!

1162
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,356
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's
wedding ring

1163
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,433
is among the jewelry
he has in that handbag?

1164
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,115
Now, during the phone conversation
he held up three rings.

1165
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:23,511
One with a diamond, one with
a big stone of some sort

1166
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,478
and then just
a plain gold band.

1167
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:29,634
And the last thing she would leave behind
would be a wedding ring.

1168
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,951
Stella, do you ever
leave yours at home?

1169
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:36,478
The only way anybody could get that ring
would be to chop off my finger.

1170
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,678
Let's go down and find out
what's buried in the garden.

1171
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:47,118
Why not? I've always wanted
to meet Mrs. Thorwald.

1172
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,896
- What are you two talking about?
- You got a shovel?

1173
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,216
A shovel? Of course
I don't have a shovel.

1174
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,038
There's probably
one in the basement.

1175
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:54,157
Jeff, if you're squeamish,
just don't look.

1176
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,560
Squeamish?
I'm not squeamish.

1177
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:59,190
I just don't want you two to end up
like that dog ended up. That's all.

1178
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,512
Oh, you know, Miss Fremont,
he might just have something there.

1179
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,671
Just hold on.
Here, take this.

1180
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,116
No sense taking any
chances in this thing.

1181
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,431
Here, give me
the phone book.

1182
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,875
What for?

1183
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,557
Maybe I can get him
out of that apartment.

1184
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:16,154
We only need
a few minutes.

1185
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,959
I'll see if I can
get about 15 minutes.

1186
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,076
How?

1187
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:20,160
Thorwald.

1188
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,634
Thorwald...
Thorwald...

1189
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:29,391
Chelsea 27099.

1190
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,879
27099.

1191
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,112
We scared him once,
maybe we can scare him again.

1192
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,873
Well, I guess I'm using that word
"we" a little freely.

1193
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,917
I mean, you're taking
all the chances.

1194
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,912
Shall we vote
him in, Stella?

1195
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,036
Unanimously.

1196
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:46,436
27099. Look out.

1197
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,040
Chelsea.

1198
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,400
Chelsea.

1199
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,591
Go on, pick it up,
Thorwald.

1200
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,478
Go on,
you're curious.

1201
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:21,592
You wonder if it's your girlfriend calling,
the one you killed for.

1202
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,353
Go on,
pick it up.

1203
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:28,790
<i>Hello?</i>

1204
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,638
Did you get my note?

1205
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,911
Well, did you get it,
Thorwald?

1206
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,150
<i>Who are you?</i>

1207
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,436
I'll give you a chance
to find out.

1208
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,274
Meet me in the bar
at the Albert Hotel.

1209
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,113
Do it right away.

1210
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,793
<i>Why should I?</i>

1211
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,394
A little business
meeting...

1212
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,880
To settle the estate
of your late wife.

1213
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:54,910
<i>I don't know
what you mean.</i>

1214
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,438
Come on. Quit stalling, Thorwald,
or I'll hang up and call the police.

1215
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,672
<i>I have only
$100 or so.</i>

1216
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,035
That's a start.

1217
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,236
I'm at the Albert now.
I'll be looking for you.

1218
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,313
Come on, Stella,
let's go.

1219
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,993
One of you keep an eye
on this window.

1220
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,676
If I see him coming back,
I'll signal with a flashbulb.

1221
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,833
<i>This is
the Doyle residence.</i>

1222
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:14,153
Hello, this is L.B. Jefferies speaking.
I'm a friend of Mr. Doyle.

1223
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:15,440
Who's this?

1224
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,636
<i>This is a babysitter.</i>

1225
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:18,200
Oh. Uh...

1226
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,509
When do you
expect them in?

1227
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:24,152
<i>Well, I'm hired till 1:00. They went
to dinner and maybe a nightclub.</i>

1228
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,874
I see.

1229
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:29,990
If he calls in, would you have him get
in touch with L.B. Jefferies right away?

1230
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,992
I might have quite
a surprise for him.

1231
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,993
<i>Well, do we have your number,
Mr. Jefferies?</i>

1232
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,197
He has it.
Good night.

1233
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,760
<i>Good night.</i>

1234
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,519
Stella was wrong
about Miss Lonelyheart.

1235
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,790
Lisa, what are you...
Don't do...

1236
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:52,600
Lisa, what are you
doing? Don't go...

1237
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:29,080
Come on, come on!
Get out of there!

1238
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:39,200
She said ring Thorwald's phone
the second you see him come back.

1239
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,296
I'm gonna ring
it right now!

1240
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:43,074
Oh, no. Give her
another minute.

1241
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,915
All right, fellows, let's try it
once from the beginning.

1242
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,753
Miss Lonelyheart.

1243
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:52,718
Oh, call the police!

1244
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,080
<i>Operator.</i>

1245
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,271
Get me the police,
sixth precinct.

1246
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,680
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1247
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,554
Mr. Jefferies,
the music stopped her.

1248
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,799
What... Lisa!

1249
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,350
Lisa!

1250
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,359
<i>Precinct 6,
Sergeant Allgood.</i>

1251
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:45,595
Hello. Hello. Look, a man is assaulting
a woman at 125 West 9th Street.

1252
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:49,230
Second floor, at the rear.
Make it fast!

1253
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,320
<i>Your name?</i>

1254
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,039
L.B. Jefferies.

1255
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,120
<i>Phone number?</i>

1256
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,476
Chelsea 25598.

1257
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,753
The door was open.

1258
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,837
- I told you...
- Oh, no!

1259
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:45,712
Let go of me! Jeff!

1260
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:46,995
Oh, no!

1261
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:48,639
Jeff! Jeff!

1262
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:50,190
Jeff!

1263
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,955
Lisa!

1264
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:56,555
Stella,
what do we do?

1265
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,835
Jeff!

1266
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,871
- Jeff!
- Well, here they come.

1267
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:53,216
What's she trying to do?
Why doesn't she turn him in?

1268
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,560
She's a smart girl.

1269
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,280
"Smart girl"?
She'll get herself arrested.

1270
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:59,034
It'll get her out
of there, won't it?

1271
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,592
Look, the wedding ring!

1272
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,869
Turn off the light!
He's seen us!

1273
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,473
How long do you think
he'll stay there?

1274
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:27,634
Well, unless he's dumber than I think he is,
he won't wait until his lease is up.

1275
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,776
Get my billfold out of the drawer
in the table there.

1276
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,029
What do you
need money for?

1277
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:32,679
I'm gonna bail
Lisa out of jail.

1278
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:35,116
You know, you could leave her
there till next Tuesday,

1279
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,635
then you could sneak
safely away as planned.

1280
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:41,634
Yeah, let's see.
$127.

1281
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:42,790
How much do you need?

1282
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,271
Well, this is first-offense burglary,
that's about $250.

1283
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:48,238
- Lisa's handbag.
- Yeah.

1284
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,670
How much
does she have?

1285
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,035
Fifty cents.

1286
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:53,315
Here, take this.

1287
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,312
Look, I got $20 or so
in my purse.

1288
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:56,896
What about the rest?
What about the rest?

1289
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:59,480
When those cops see Lisa,
they'll even contribute.

1290
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:00,835
Well, hurry up.

1291
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:07,436
Just a minute.
Hurry up!

1292
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,116
Jefferies.

1293
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,839
<i>All right.
What is it now?</i>

1294
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:14,118
Doyle, I've got
something really big for you.

1295
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,112
<i>Why did I have to
return your call?</i>

1296
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:19,398
<i>Look, Jeff! Don't louse up my night
with another mad killer...</i>

1297
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:24,077
Listen to me! Listen to me!
Lisa's in jail. She got arrested.

1298
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,159
<i>- Your Lisa?</i>
- My Lisa.

1299
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:30,075
Boy, you should have seen her.
She got into Thorwald's apartment.

1300
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:33,376
But then he came back, and the only way
I could get her out was to call the police.

1301
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,039
<i>- I told you...</i>
- I know you told me!

1302
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:38,192
She went in to get evidence
and she came out with evidence.

1303
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:39,919
<i>- Like what?</i>
- Like what?

1304
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,913
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring.
That's like what.

1305
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,789
If that woman was alive,
she'd be wearing that ring. Right?

1306
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,997
<i>- A possibility.</i>
- A possibility. It's a fact!

1307
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:54,120
He killed a dog last night because the dog was
scratching around in the garden.

1308
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:58,353
You know why? Because he had something buried
in that garden that the dog scented.

1309
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:59,556
<i>Like an old
ham bone?</i>

1310
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:02,712
Look, I don't know what pet names
Thorwald had for his wife,

1311
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,194
but I'll tell you this,

1312
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:07,512
all those trips at night
with that metal suitcase,

1313
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,239
he wasn't taking
out his possessions,

1314
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:12,757
because his possessions
are still up in the apartment.

1315
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,479
<i>Perhaps it was
old "ham bone."</i>

1316
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:16,193
Yeah, in sections.

1317
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:17,634
And I'll tell you
something else.

1318
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:20,792
All the telephone calls he made were
long distance, all right?

1319
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,635
Now, if he called his wife
long distance on the day she left,

1320
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,916
after she arrived
in Merritsville,

1321
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,277
why did she write a card to him saying that
she'd arrived in Merritsville?

1322
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,192
Why did she do that?

1323
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:34,195
<i>Where'd they
take Lisa?</i>

1324
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:35,280
Precinct 6.

1325
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,736
I sent somebody over
with the bail money.

1326
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:38,194
<i>Maybe you
won't need it.</i>

1327
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:39,280
<i>I'll run it down, Jeff.</i>

1328
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,431
All right. All right.
Now hurry up, will you?

1329
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,352
This fellow knows
he's being watched.

1330
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,272
He's not gonna wait
around forever. Hurry up.

1331
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,352
<i>If that ring checks out,
we'll give him an escort.</i>

1332
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,557
<i>- So long, Jeff.</i>
- So long.

1333
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:01,555
Hello. Hello. Tom, I think
Thorwald's left. I don't see...

1334
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:05,640
Hello...

1335
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,432
What do you
want from me?

1336
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,431
Your friend, the girl,
could have turned me in.

1337
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,074
Why didn't she?

1338
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:52,989
What is it you want? A lot of money?
I don't have any money.

1339
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,313
Say something.

1340
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,953
Say something!
Tell me what you want!

1341
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:08,351
Can you get me
that ring back?

1342
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,000
No.

1343
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:12,912
Tell her
to bring it back!

1344
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,117
I can't. The police
have it by now.

1345
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:54,112
Lisa! Doyle!

1346
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:03,954
Over there!

1347
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:12,269
Look! Look, over
in that apartment!

1348
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,640
Doyle!

1349
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,837
Creele!
Give me your .38!

1350
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,656
I'm sorry, Jeff.
I got here as fast as I could!

1351
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:53,496
Oh, Mr. Jefferies!
Don't let anybody touch him.

1352
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,398
Get my medical bag
from upstairs.

1353
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:57,597
Oh, Lisa, sweetie,
if anything had happened to you...

1354
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:59,433
Oh, shut up.
I'm all right.

1355
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,477
Gee, I'm proud of you!

1356
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:04,876
You got enough for
a search warrant now?

1357
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,155
Oh, yeah, sure.

1358
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,277
- Lieutenant Doyle!
- Yeah?

1359
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,430
Is he okay?

1360
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,556
He's alive.

1361
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:14,190
Thorwald's ready to take us
on a tour of the East River.

1362
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,671
Did he say what was
buried in the flower bed?

1363
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:25,919
Yeah. He said the dog got
too inquisitive, so he dug it up.

1364
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:29,354
It's in a hat box over
in his apartment.

1365
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:31,000
- Want to look?
- No, thanks.

1366
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,276
I don't want any
part of her.

1367
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,319
I hope it's gonna be a hit.
This is the first release.

1368
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,312
I'd love
to hear it.

1369
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:47,711
I can't tell you what this music
has meant to me.

1370
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:03,079
<i>Lisa, with your starry eyes</i>

1371
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,197
Now, let's try
it again, puppy.

1372
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,476
Stay still. Stay.

1373
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:13,670
<i>Hold me and whisper the sweet words
I'm yearning for</i>

1374
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,194
<i>Drown me in kisses</i>

1375
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:16,760
- Stanley!
- Hi, baby!

1376
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,754
<i>Caresses I'm burning for</i>

1377
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,639
My, look what the Army's done
for you!

1378
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,473
<i>Lisa, every touch is
new ecstasy</i>

1379
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:28,600
The Army's made me hungry.
What've you got in the icebox to eat?

1380
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,351
Boy, it's good
to be home.

1381
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:34,672
<i>Lisa, angels dance
when you cling to me</i>

1382
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,353
I don't care
if you help me or not,

1383
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,433
but if you'd told me you'd quit your job,
we wouldn't have gotten married.

1384
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,398
Oh, honey, come on...

1385
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:46,430
<i>If this is dreaming</i>

1386
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:52,431
<i>I hope I'll never wake</i>

1387
01:51:54,280 --> 01:52:00,197
<i>But dream forever</i>

1388
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:08,080
<i>In your arms, oh, Lisa</i>

1389
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:15,160
<i>Lisa</i>
