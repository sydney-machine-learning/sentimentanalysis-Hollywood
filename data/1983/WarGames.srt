1
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,625
Replacement team's here, sir.

2
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,792
Right.

3
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,875
Come on through.

4
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,875
20 minutes and we were gonna
start looking for you.

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,375
Yeah. It's really something out there.

6
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:27,500
- You look a mess, sir.
- Yeah?

7
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,542
Your turn next, Ginsburg.

8
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:38,000
OK. I'll see you in 24.

9
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:39,750
See you tomorrow.

10
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,250
What was that you were you saying?

11
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,875
You used to hear her chant
all night long. Om mahneypod me om.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,375
- Om mahneypod me om.
- Over the plants?

13
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,625
She'd cup her hands over those seeds
and chant by the hour.

14
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,708
She grew the most beautiful
wandoos you ever saw, man.

15
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,792
Primo stuff. Resin city.

16
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,542
Stand clear.

17
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:19,125
The commander's been worried
about you. The roads must be a bear.

18
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,333
- What roads?
- Visibility.

19
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:25,958
Visibility? Bullshit. You guys haven't
been on time for the last six months.

20
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:29,583
- I wrote you guys up in the logbook.
- Yeah. You're a prince, Bevan.

21
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,333
Good night, gentlemen!

22
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,708
So, that was like sinsemilia, right?

23
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,417
Sinsemilla. This grass made
Thai stick taste like oregano.

24
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,500
Lay you out flat, man.

25
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:57,500
- Got a red light, sir.
- What on?

26
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,500
Number eight. Warhead alarm.

27
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,792
Give it a thump with your finger.

28
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:08,250
Alarm reset.

29
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:26,125
Skybird, this is Dropkick with
a Red dash Alpha message in two parts.

30
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,208
Break. Break. Red dash Alpha.

31
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,792
- Stand by to copy message.
- Standing by.

32
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:34,083
Romeo Oscar November Charlie

33
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,625
Tango Tango Lima Alpha.

34
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,750
Authentication: 220040 Delta

35
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:45,417
Lima.

36
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,458
I have a valid message.
Stand by to authenticate.

37
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,958
I agree with authentication also, sir.

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,583
- Enter launch code.
- Entering launch code.

39
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,833
- Launch order confirmed.
- Holy shit!

40
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:27,708
Target selection: complete.
Time on target sequence: complete.

41
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,125
- Yield selection: complete.
- Begin countdown. Tminus 60.

42
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,208
- All right. Let's do it. Insert launch key.
- Stand by.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,750
- Launch key inserted.
- Roger.

44
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:41,000
On my mark... rotate launch key to Set.

45
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,542
Three... two... one...

46
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,542
- Mark.
- Tminus 50.

47
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,250
Roger. At Set.

48
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,750
- Sir?
- Tminus 40.

49
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:10,250
- Enable missiles.
- Number one enabled. Two enabled.

50
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,500
- Three enabled.
- Get somebody on the goddamn phone.

51
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:17,667
Seven... eight...

52
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,500
Nine...

53
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,750
Ten. All missiles enabled.

54
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,917
- Get me Wing Command Post. Direct line.
- That's not the correct procedure.

55
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:33,333
- Try SAC Headquarters on the HF.
- That's not the procedure.

56
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,542
I want somebody on the goddamn phone
before I kill 20 million people.

57
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,667
T minus 20.

58
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:46,542
I got nothin' here! They might
have been knocked out already.

59
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,250
Right.

60
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,417
On my mark,
rotate launch keys to Launch.

61
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,667
Roger. Ready to go to Launch.

62
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,083
- Fourteen...
- Thirteen... twelve...

63
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,458
Eleven...

64
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,708
Seven... six...

65
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,083
- Five...
- Sir, we have a launch order.

66
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,208
- Three... two...
- Put your hand on the key, sir.

67
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,125
One... Launch!

68
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,000
- Sir, we are at launch! Turn your key!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

69
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,583
Turn your key, sir!

70
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,583
They're cleared. Go ahead and open it up.

71
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:15,417
- Hello. I'm Pat Healy.
- I'm Lyle Watson. This is Arthur Cabot.

72
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:19,917
I'm Pat Healy, Dr McKittrick's assistant.
I've got some passes for you here.

73
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,792
We had scheduled a meeting
pending your arrival.

74
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:25,542
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me.

75
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,625
I'd be happy to fill you in
if there's any way I can.

76
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,042
They're here.

77
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,667
Good.

78
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,250
Let's go.

79
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,250
Cabot and Watson came alone.
No senators. No congressmen.

80
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:35,542
I wish they'd brought a few senators.
I'd like to tell 'em what's going on here.

81
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:38,292
John, please! Don't start that right away.

82
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,833
I had them on the phone
and they're calmed down.

83
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:47,917
Well, are we positive that these men had
no way of knowing this was only a test?

84
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:51,542
Lyle, for God's sakes! How many times
are we gonna go through this?

85
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,958
- It doesn't make any difference.
- I've spoken to these men.

86
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,333
They all believed it was the real deal.

87
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,083
Look, we gotta be on a plane
in less than an hour.

88
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:04,208
I have to explain to the president
why 22% of his missile commanders

89
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:08,875
failed to launch their missiles. What
am I supposed to say? 22% isn't so bad?

90
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,542
The president knows that I am fully
responsible for the men in my command.

91
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,458
I've ordered a re-evaluation of
our psychological screening procedure.

92
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,750
Wait a minute. Excuse me, General.

93
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,833
We can't ask these men
to go back to the president

94
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,125
with a lot of headshrinker horseshit!
You can't screen out human response!

95
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,833
Those men know what it means to turn
the keys, and some are just not up to it!

96
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,542
Now, it's as simple as that!

97
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,708
I think we oughta take
the men out of the loop.

98
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:44,292
- Mr McKittrick, you're out of line, sir.
- Why am I out of line?

99
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:45,875
Excuse me!

100
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,458
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Take them out of the loop?

101
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,250
Gentlemen! We've had men in these silos

102
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,750
since before any of you
were watching Howdy Doody.

103
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,458
For myself, I sleep pretty well at night
knowing those boys are down there.

104
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:07,542
General, we know they're fine men,
but in a nuclear war we can't afford

105
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,333
to have missiles
lying dormant in those silos

106
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:14,125
because those men refuse to turn
the keys when the computers tell 'em to!

107
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,375
You mean when
the president orders them to.

108
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:21,042
The president will probably follow
the computer war plan. That's a fact!

109
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,792
I imagine the Joint Chiefs
will have some input.

110
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,458
- You're damn tootin'.
- Well, hell...

111
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,958
In a surprise attack, there's no time.

112
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,542
23 minutes from warning to impact.

113
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,667
- Six minutes if it's sub-launched.
- Six minutes.

114
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:38,500
That's barely enough time
for the president to make a decision.

115
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,417
Once he makes the decision,
the computer should take over.

116
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:45,125
Now, sir, I know that you've got
a plane waiting for you,

117
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,583
but if you could indulge me,
I'd like to show you something.

118
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:59,000
These computers give instant access
to the state of the world.

119
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,417
Troop movements, Soviet
missile tests, weather patterns.

120
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:06,250
It all flows into this room,
and then into the WOPR computer.

121
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,750
- WOPR? What is that?
- War Operation Plan Response.

122
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,625
This is Mr Richter.

123
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,500
Paul, would you like to tell
these gentlemen about the WOPR?

124
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:19,875
Well, the WOPR spends all its time
thinking about World War Ill.

125
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,958
24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
it plays an endless series of war games

126
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,542
using all available information
on the state of the world.

127
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,375
The WOPR has already fought
World War Ill, as a game,

128
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,500
time and time again.

129
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,667
It estimates Soviet responses
to our responses

130
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,000
to their responses, and so on.

131
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,583
Estimates damage. Counts the dead.

132
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,375
Then it looks for ways
to improve its score...

133
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,833
The point is that the key decisions

134
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,958
of every option have already
been made by the WOPR.

135
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,583
So all this trillion-dollar hardware
is really at the mercy

136
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,000
of those men with the little brass keys?

137
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,667
That's exactly right. Whose only problem
is that they're human beings.

138
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:07,458
But in 30 days we could put in electronic
relays. Get the men out of the loop.

139
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,125
Gentlemen...

140
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,625
I wouldn't trust this overgrown pile of
microchips further than I could throw it.

141
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:20,208
I don't know if you wanna trust the safety
of our country to some... silicon diode...

142
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,792
Nobody is talking about entrusting
the safety of the nation

143
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:25,875
to a machine, for God's sake!

144
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,917
We'll keep control,
but here at the top where it belongs.

145
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,417
All right, gentlemen.

146
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:34,500
I think I'm going to recommend
McKittrick's idea to the president.

147
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,000
And I'll get back to you on this.

148
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,667
You won't regret this.

149
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,083
OK. You had fries and a Coke, right?

150
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,833
Damn!

151
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,208
- Hi, David!
- Hi, Howie!

152
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,208
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

153
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,333
- You wanna take this over? I gotta go.
- Sure!

154
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,417
- Go ahead.
- Thanks!

155
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,875
- Bye, David!
- Bye!

156
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:57,792
All right. Question number two.

157
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:05,458
Seeds that are germinated in water
before they are planted will... what?

158
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,792
- Robert?
- Sprout roots?

159
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,583
Ah! David!

160
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:14,000
Nice of you to join us.
Oh, David. I have a little present for you.

161
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,583
Question number four.
In the history of science,

162
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:31,125
novel and innovative concepts
occasionally arise

163
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,625
from sudden left-field inspiration.

164
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,458
Miss Mack...

165
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,792
Could you tell us your answer
to question number four?

166
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:42,292
Why do nitrogen nodules
cling to the roots of plants?

167
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,708
Love?

168
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:54,042
Jennifer, what do you know about
nitrogen nodules that we don't?

169
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:57,542
Some bit of salacious info
to which you alone are privy?

170
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,083
- No.
- I see.

171
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,375
No, you didn't know
the correct answer - symbiosis.

172
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,708
Because you don't pay attention in class.

173
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,167
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

174
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:18,375
There seems to be a lot of confusion on
this next question - asexual reproduction.

175
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,542
Could someone tell me, please

176
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:26,750
who first suggested the idea
of reproduction without sex?

177
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,292
- Miss Mack!
- Yes?

178
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,917
What is so amusing?

179
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,167
What?

180
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:45,875
All right, Lightman.

181
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Maybe you can tell us who first suggested
the idea of reproduction without sex.

182
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,458
Your wife?

183
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,542
Get out, Lightman! Get out!

184
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:11,250
Mr Ligget wants me to discuss
my attitude problem with Mr Kessler.

185
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,583
I think Mr Kessler's getting tired
of your attitude problem.

186
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,292
Me, too.

187
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,125
Lightman. What a... surprise.

188
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,208
Won't you come in?

189
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,583
Hi!

190
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,625
Hi!

191
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,667
Sorry if I got you in trouble.
I couldn't stop laughing.

192
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,750
That's OK. You were perfect.

193
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,833
- I was?
- Yeah.

194
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,917
- You want a ride home?
- Yeah.

195
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:21,875
Hop on.

196
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:31,958
- So you got an F on that test today, too?
- Yep.

197
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,750
Guess we're both gonna be
stuck in summer school.

198
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,667
- Not me.
- Why not? You have to make up biology.

199
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,625
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

200
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,167
- Why not? Come on! Tell me. Why not?
- Make a left.

201
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,292
Why don't you come up to my house
and I'll show you?

202
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,417
What are you gonna show me?

203
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,583
I'm gonna show you.
I'll show you how you do it.

204
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,542
- Hi, Bo!
- Oh! Hi, Bo!

205
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,583
Hey, Bo! How you doin'?

206
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,375
My room's upstairs.

207
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,458
- Your parents aren't home?
- No. They both work.

208
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:40,833
A little mess.

209
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,917
It's OK. You should see my room.

210
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:54,833
- You're really into computers, huh?
- Yeah.

211
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:03,250
- What are you doing?
- I'm dialing into the school's computer.

212
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:19,542
They change the password every couple
of weeks, but I know where they write it.

213
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,583
- Are those your grades?!
- Yeah.

214
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,917
I don't think that I deserved an F, do you?

215
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,167
- You can't do that!
- Already done.

216
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:49,625
- Do you have a middle initial?
- K. Katherine.

217
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:57,375
Those are my grades.

218
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,083
- How can anybody get a D in home EC?
- That's none of your business.

219
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,500
- Can you erase this?
- No. It's too late.

220
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,417
What are you doing?

221
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:09,292
- I'm changing your biology grade.
- No. You'll get me in trouble.

222
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:13,208
Nobody can find out. You got a C!
Now you won't go to summer school.

223
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,375
- Change it back.
- Why? They can't...

224
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,542
- I said change it back.
- OK. OK.

225
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,250
I guess I'd better get going.

226
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,667
Thanks for the ride.

227
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,542
Yeah. OK. Bye.

228
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,625
Bye.

229
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:37,708
Get down. Get down. You've already
had your dinner. Now just sit.

230
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,833
Sit! Stay!

231
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,625
- Don't forget to take out the garbage.
- David.

232
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,542
- Put that lid on real tight.
- I know, Ma.

233
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,750
Yes, they will carry back on the second.

234
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,375
Sure. I think we can really work out
some creative financing.

235
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,042
Oh, but you've gotta see it!

236
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,750
There's a Jacuzzi
in the master bedroom...

237
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh, sure. We can work that out.

238
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:19,000
That is true. You'll have a balloon
payment at the end of five years.

239
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:22,417
But that's nothing.
The economy is gonna be great then.

240
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,583
He who dances must pay the piper.

241
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:28,292
- See you, Dad.
- I'll meet you tomorrow at 9.30. Bye.

242
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,125
You know, I worry about that kid.

243
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,208
Why?

244
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,500
Sometimes I think
we're all gonna get electrocuted.

245
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:45,500
This corn is raw!

246
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:48,125
I know. Isn't it wonderful? It's so crisp.

247
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,000
- Of course it's crisp! It's raw!
- It's terrific!

248
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,125
You can just taste the vitamin
A and D in here. It's great.

249
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:57,792
Couldn't we have pills,
and cook the corn?

250
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:01,000
- What city, please?
- For Sunnyvale, California.

251
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,083
The number for Protovision.

252
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,333
Yes. That's 555 8632.

253
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,292
Thank you. Could you also tell me
what other prefixes cover that area?

254
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:16,625
There's 399, 437, 767, 936.

255
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,125
Thanks.

256
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,333
Protovision... I have you now.

257
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes?

258
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:05,250
Saul's Fish Market.

259
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,875
- Hi!
- Oh, hi!

260
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,375
What?

261
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,292
I've been thinking.
That thing with my grade.

262
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,958
- Can you still change it?
- Oh, I don't know...

263
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:32,708
I can't believe I was so stupid.
I should've just let you do it.

264
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,792
- I don't know. It might be kinda rough.
- Why?

265
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:38,208
They might have changed the password.

266
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,708
Maybe they didn't. Can't we at least try?

267
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,917
- Damn!
- Please.

268
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,417
OK.

269
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:52,000
- You owe me a quarter.
- Yeah. Come on. Sorry I lost your game.

270
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,917
- What's it doing?
- Oh. It's dialing numbers.

271
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,625
- Don't touch the keys!
- I'm not touching the keys.

272
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,125
Excuse me.

273
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,583
This computer company's coming out
with these amazing new games soon.

274
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:18,500
The programs are probably
still on their computer.

275
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:23,000
So I told my system to search for other
computers in Sunnyvale, California.

276
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,875
They answer with a tone that other
computers can recognize. You hear?

277
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,375
You're calling every number
in Sunnyvale?

278
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:39,292
- Isn't that expensive?
- There's ways around that.

279
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:42,000
You can go to jail for that.

280
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,167
Only if you're over 18.

281
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:49,542
Is this going to take a long time?
I'd like to get my grade changed.

282
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,250
Oh. That's funny, actually.

283
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:54,375
Cos...

284
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,542
I already changed it.

285
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,792
- I told you not to do that.
- Yeah, I know.

286
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:03,833
But I figured you'd change your mind.
I didn't want you to flunk.

287
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,208
- Well, what did I get?
- You got a D.

288
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:10,625
- You gave me a D?
- No. You got an A.

289
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,625
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

290
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,875
Well, that's OK.

291
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,125
Here. Let's see what we have so far.

292
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:19,750
Excuse me.

293
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,833
Did you really give me an A?

294
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,917
Yeah.

295
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:27,042
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

296
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:33,750
Hey! You got a bank!

297
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:36,875
Gotta make a note of that one.
Might come in handy someday.

298
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:43,583
Pan Am.

299
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:46,500
- Where shall we go?
- Anywhere?

300
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,583
- Anywhere.
- New York?

301
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,417
- New York. OK.
- No, Paris. Paris.

302
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,333
Will you be traveling alone?

303
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:01,083
Yeah... No. You wanna go with me?

304
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,625
OK.

305
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,917
- All right. Smoking or nonsmoking?
- Nonsmoking.

306
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:13,667
All right, Miss Mack. You're
confirmed on Pan Am's flight 1 14

307
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:18,542
Ieaving Chicago's O'Hare Airport
at 8.15am on 18 August.

308
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:21,042
Do we need a rental car? No.

309
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:25,625
- Do we really have tickets to Paris?
- No. You have a reservation though.

310
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,958
It doesn't identify itself.

311
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,292
Try anything.

312
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:45,833
"Connection terminated." How rude.

313
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,917
We'll ask it for help.

314
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:50,167
- Can you do that?
- On some systems.

315
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:54,333
The more complicated they are,
the more they have to help you out.

316
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,042
Now what?

317
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,750
Help games.

318
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,625
"Games" refers to models,
simulations and games

319
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:16,750
which have strategic applications.
What does that mean?

320
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:19,833
I don't know. That's gotta be them.
Turn on the printer.

321
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,375
List games.

322
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,583
Oh, my God!

323
00:29:57,417 --> 00:30:00,333
So these guys can tell you
what that print-out means?

324
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:03,250
They probably invented it
in the first place.

325
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:23,667
- Can you wait here?
- Why?

326
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,625
- Cos these guys can get a little nervous.
- OK.

327
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,458
Jim.

328
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:38,625
Oh. Lightman.

329
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,458
Hi, Lightman!

330
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,583
I want you to take a look at this.

331
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,500
- Hey! What's that?
- I wanted Jim to see that.

332
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,667
Wow! Where'd you get this?

333
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:03,250
Protovision. I wanted to see
the program for their new games.

334
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,667
- Can I have this?
- I'm not through yet.

335
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:12,667
Remember you told me to tell you when
you were acting rudely and insensitively?

336
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,625
You're doing it right now.

337
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:23,458
"Theatrewide biotoxic
and chemical warfare."

338
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:29,333
- This didn't come from Protovision.
- Ask him where it did come from, Jim!

339
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,500
- I told you already.
- Looks military to me. Definitely.

340
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:36,458
- Probably classified, too.
- If it's military, why does it have games

341
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:40,667
- Iike checkers and backgammon?
- Those games teach basic strategy.

342
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:43,792
Jim, how do I get into that system?
I wanna play those games.

343
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:48,042
That system probably contains
the new data encryption algorithm.

344
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:51,708
- You'll never get in.
- No system is totally secure.

345
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,250
- I bet you Jim could get in.
- I bet you he couldn't!

346
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:57,750
- I bet you he could.
- You won't get through frontline security.

347
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:01,208
- But you might look for a back door.
- I can't believe it, Jim!

348
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,250
That girl's listening,
and you talk about back doors!

349
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,542
Mr Potato-head.

350
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:08,417
Mr Potato-head!
Back doors are not secrets!

351
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:12,292
- You're giving away all our best tricks.
- They're not tricks.

352
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:15,333
- What's a back door?
- Whenever I design a system

353
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,792
I put in a password
that only I know about.

354
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:20,583
That way, whenever I wanna get back in,

355
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:25,250
I can bypass whatever security they've
added on. That's basically what it is.

356
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,208
Yeah?

357
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:31,708
OK. You really wanna get in, find out
about the guy who designed the system.

358
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,042
Come on! I don't even
know the guy's name.

359
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:39,042
Boy, are you guys dumb! You guys are
so dumb. I got this thing all figured out.

360
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,667
Oh, yeah, Malvin? How would you do it?

361
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:45,750
The first game in the list.
Go right through Falken's Maze.

362
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,625
Hi! I'm Jennifer.

363
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,667
- Is David here?
- How do you do?

364
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,708
Yeah. He's up in his room.

365
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:55,833
Thanks.

366
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:58,625
Have you ever heard
of the word tumulus?

367
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:01,500
Tumulus? No. I haven't. I'm sorry.

368
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,583
Neither have l.

369
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:06,667
Yeah?

370
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:09,000
Hi!

371
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,792
- Where have you been?
- What?

372
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:15,042
I haven't seen you all week in school.
Are you sick?

373
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,875
No, no. I was...

374
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,042
I was doing things.
You wanna sit down? How are you?

375
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:24,667
- No. I'm going to get some water, OK?
- OK.

376
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,250
- What is all that stuff?
- Oh, it's nothing. I was just...

377
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:32,417
I was trying to find out about the guy
who designed those game programs,

378
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:34,750
so I could get his secret password.

379
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,458
- Why?
- Why? Cos...

380
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:40,583
What's so special about playing
games with some machine?

381
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:41,833
Oh, no...

382
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,125
No, it's not just some machine.

383
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,542
Here. Look at this.

384
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:49,167
This is a tape that I got from the library.

385
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:51,292
It's about this guy named Falken.

386
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:55,542
He was into games as well as computers.

387
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:59,292
He designed them so that
they could play checkers or poker.

388
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:01,667
- Chess.
- What's so great about that?

389
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:05,292
- Everybody's doing that now.
- Oh, no, no. What he did was great!

390
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:08,708
He designed his computer
so it could learn from its mistakes.

391
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,458
So they'd be better
the next time they played.

392
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,125
The system actually learned how to learn.

393
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,917
It could teach itself.

394
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,667
If I could just get that damn password,
I could play the computer.

395
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:26,375
That's him. That's Falken.

396
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:30,542
That's him? Wow!

397
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,625
He's amazing-looking!

398
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,625
Can't you write to him
or call him somehow?

399
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,083
No. He's dead.

400
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,958
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

401
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,125
Here. Look. Here's his obituary.

402
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:48,167
- He wasn't very old.
- Well, he was pretty old. He was 41 .

403
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,958
Oh, yeah? Oh, that's old.

404
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,583
That's his little boy.

405
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,667
Oh, yeah?

406
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,708
This is really sad. Did you know the child
and his mother were killed in a car crash?

407
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,917
- I know.
- "In the years that followed

408
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:09,042
the tragic loss of his family,
Dr Falken's health deteriorated."

409
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,708
My dad is 45.

410
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:23,875
- Once he was really sick...
- What was his name?

411
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:28,292
- My father?
- No, no, no. Falken's kid.

412
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,208
Joshua.

413
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,208
It can't be that simple.

414
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,458
- Wow!
- What?

415
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:48,375
We got something.

416
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,667
We're in!

417
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,167
It thinks I'm Falken!

418
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:04,500
Hello.

419
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:12,875
- How can it ask you that?
- It'll ask whatever it's programmed to.

420
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,958
- Do you wanna hear it talk?
- Yeah!

421
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:17,667
I'll ask it how it feels.

422
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:23,375
I'm fine. How are... you?

423
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:27,667
Excellent. It's been a long time.

424
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:34,833
Can you explain the removal of
your user account on June 23rd, 1973?

425
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,917
They must have told it he died.

426
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:43,833
People sometimes make... mistakes.

427
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:46,625
- Yes, they do.
- How can it talk?

428
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:51,708
It's not a real voice. This box interprets
signals and turns them into sound.

429
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:54,208
Shall we play a game?

430
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,708
Oh!

431
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:59,542
- I think it missed him.
- Yeah. Weird, isn't it?

432
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,250
Love to!

433
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:07,333
How about Global Thermonuclear War?

434
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,375
Wouldn't you prefer
a good game of chess?

435
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,458
Later.

436
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:14,625
Let's play

437
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,708
Global Thermonuclear War.

438
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,583
Fine.

439
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,250
All right!

440
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,958
Wow!

441
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:30,500
Which side do you want?

442
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,500
I'll be the Russians.

443
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,792
Please list primary targets.

444
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:44,292
- Who shall we nuke first?
- Let's see.

445
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:47,083
How about... Las Vegas?

446
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,583
Las Vegas! Great!

447
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,708
- What next? Seattle!
- Yeah!

448
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,917
Kill 'em!

449
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:10,708
I have seven, correction, eight Red birds
two degrees past apogee.

450
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,833
Better get the old man down here.

451
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,000
We have Soviet missile warning.

452
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,500
Check formal function
and report confidence.

453
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,708
Projected target areas
NORAD regions 25, 26.

454
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:41,292
This is Crystal Palace initiating
emergency conference. Stand by!

455
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,333
19 degrees past apogee.

456
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:50,708
Possible 18 targets in track.
Estimate re-entry at 19.23 Zulu.

457
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,417
- What you got up here, Joe?
- We have a radar tracking.

458
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,667
Eight inbound Soviet ICBMs
already over the pole.

459
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:08,375
Estimated impact: 1 1 minutes.
Target area: Western United States.

460
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,625
- Why didn't we get a launch detection?
- We're checking for DSP malfunction.

461
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:16,375
BMEWS has continuous radar tracking
on inbounds.

462
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,417
Confidence is high.
I repeat, confidence is high.

463
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,375
- What is all that stuff?
- Trajectory headings

464
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:31,875
- for multiple-impact re-entry vehicles.
- What does that mean?

465
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,958
I don't know. But it's great!

466
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:36,792
- Are those bombs? Which is the bombs?
- Subs.

467
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:39,042
- Blow 'em up.
- Blow 'em out of the water.

468
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,750
- What's a trajectory heading?
- I've no idea.

469
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,917
The president's diverting to Andrews.
The vice president is out of position.

470
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:55,125
- The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is on...
- Missile warning reports no malfunction.

471
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,208
Take us to DEFCON 3.

472
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,958
Get onto SAC.
Tell 'em to flush the bombers.

473
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,417
Yes, sir.

474
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:07,125
SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
CinC NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.

475
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,042
Scramble all alert aircraft.
I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.

476
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:14,125
Inbounds presently MIRVing.

477
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,708
We now have approximately
24 possible targets in track.

478
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:22,042
- New time to impact: eight minutes.
- SAC is launching the bombers.

479
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,792
- General Powers is on the line.
- Beringer.

480
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:30,042
Goddamn it! We didn't get
a launch detection from our satellite.

481
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:35,208
Radar picked 'em up already out of the
atmosphere. That's the first we heard of it.

482
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:39,000
Get the ICBMs in the bullpen
warmed up and ready to fly.

483
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,833
- Get me the president on the horn.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:52,125
Mr President? This is Beringer at NORAD.

485
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,208
Oh, attack!

486
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:57,917
- I wonder if I should use my subs.
- Sure. Give 'em the works.

487
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,958
David!

488
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,292
Excuse me.

489
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:05,375
David!

490
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,125
How many times have I told you
to fasten these lids on tight?!

491
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,000
- Look at this mess!
- I'll be down in a few minutes.

492
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,708
Now! Come down now!
I want this cleared up now!

493
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:18,750
Come down here and do what
your father asks you to pronto, David.

494
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,417
We're gonna barbecue tonight.

495
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:24,708
- You wanna invite your little friend?
- Please!

496
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:25,833
David!

497
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,958
Shit!

498
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:37,583
Little friend.

499
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:49,292
Mr President, something's happening.
I'll get back to you as soon as I know.

500
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:54,458
- What's happening, Joe?
- BMEWS and Cobra Dane now report

501
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:57,708
negative confirmation
on all inbound tracking.

502
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:01,375
Get onto SAC. Tell 'em to hold steady.

503
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:06,917
Stop! It's a simulation!
There's an attack simulation running!

504
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:09,417
What the hell's he yelling about?
I didn't order that.

505
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:12,292
We're not being attacked!
It's a simulation!

506
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:14,000
Whoa, now! Hold it!

507
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,292
You're not supposed to be runnin' here.

508
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:18,333
We don't know how it happened.

509
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:22,208
Someone outside fed an attack simulation
into the main... It's a simulation!

510
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:23,750
Conley...

511
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,708
Take us off full alert.

512
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:30,458
Hold at DEFCON 4 till we find out exactly
what in the hell's happening here!

513
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:34,792
I didn't tell you to cut the line!
Did I tell you to cut it? You cut the line!

514
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:37,583
They shut down
before we could complete our trace.

515
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,708
We did locate the area
where the transmission originated.

516
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,792
- Where?
- Seattle, Washington.

517
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:44,708
Shut it down!

518
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,958
Somebody's playing a game with us.

519
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:49,583
At a prophylactic recycling centre...

520
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:50,667
Hi, Dad!

521
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:52,625
David!

522
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:55,542
- David, come in here!
- What did I do?

523
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:57,583
Plenty, mister. Plenty.

524
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,625
You have just passed
all of your classes this semester.

525
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,708
Congratulations, dear!

526
00:45:04,792 --> 00:45:06,750
Show this to your dad.

527
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:10,125
Honey! David has something to show you.

528
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,208
- What's that?
- Here, Dad.

529
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:14,083
Uh-oh.

530
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:18,250
This is good!

531
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:20,333
I'm so proud of you!

532
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:22,667
..went on a full-scale nuclear alert,

533
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,792
believing the Soviet Union
had launched a missile attack.

534
00:45:25,917 --> 00:45:29,250
A spokesman places blame
on a computer malfunction,

535
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:32,333
emphasizing that the problem
has been corrected.

536
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,708
For more on the story,
let's go live to Washington DC.

537
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,208
Well, that's your phone.

538
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,292
Yeah.

539
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:46,417
Seriously, David. Congratulations.
This one'll be a pleasure to sign!

540
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,333
- Hello?
- David?

541
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:56,167
Are you watching the news?

542
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:58,750
Jennifer. Yeah, I'm watching.

543
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,458
David, is that us on TV? Did we do that?

544
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:03,917
It could be. Oh, Jesus, Jennifer!

545
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:08,042
What am I gonna do? They're gonna
come get me. I'm really screwed!

546
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:10,125
I'm screwed!

547
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,875
No! Sh! Calm down!
Sh! Calm down, calm down. Listen...

548
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,792
If they were so smart,
they would have found you already.

549
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:17,833
Yeah.

550
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:22,250
OK. So all you have to do is throw
the number away and don't call it again.

551
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:23,583
- That's all.
- Yeah.

552
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:28,458
- Maybe they didn't trace the call.
- Right! Maybe they didn't trace the call.

553
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:32,333
I'm sure they didn't trace the call.
All you have to do is act normal.

554
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:35,250
We'll both act normal
and everything will be fine.

555
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,583
OK?

556
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,708
- OK.
- OK.

557
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:43,250
God! This is so unbelievable!
Can I call Michelle and tell her?

558
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:45,417
No, Jennifer! Don't call her!

559
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:49,250
Sorry. All right. I won't.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, OK?

560
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,708
OK. Good night, Jennifer.

561
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:23,750
Greetings, Professor Falken.

562
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,333
Oh, my God.

563
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:37,542
Incorrect identification.

564
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,875
I am not Falken.

565
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,917
Falken is dead.

566
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:47,042
Sorry to hear that, Professor.

567
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:49,542
Yesterday's game was interrupted.

568
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:55,375
Although primary goal has not yet
been achieved, solution is near.

569
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,750
Game time elapsed:
31 hours 12 minutes 50 seconds.

570
00:48:00,792 --> 00:48:07,625
Estimated time remaining:
52 hours 17 minutes 10 seconds.

571
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,917
What is the primary goal?

572
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,750
You should know, Professor.
You programmed me.

573
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,750
Oh, come on.

574
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:22,500
What is the primary goal?

575
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,625
To win the game.

576
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:54,458
David Lightman, hold it right there. FBI.

577
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:57,083
- I'll read you your rights.
- Step over to the van.

578
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:59,875
You have the absolute right
to remain silent.

579
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,958
What did I do?

580
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,500
You have the right
to consult with an attorney

581
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,833
and to have one present
during questioning.

582
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:10,625
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you by the court.

583
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,083
- Do you understand these rights?
- Yeah.

584
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:16,708
Are you willing to talk to me
about the charges against you?

585
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:18,708
All right. Let's move.

586
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,500
This rather large room
is command center for NORAD.

587
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:37,917
No picture taking. The screens in front
of you are connected to our satellites

588
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:41,125
and missile tracking stations
throughout the country.

589
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,250
This is the commander's desk.
Colonel Conley is in charge.

590
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,000
Would you mind relinquishing
your command, sir?

591
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:50,833
Miss Dailey, would you come
and sit in this rather important chair?

592
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:54,417
These buttons are connected
with the Strategic Air Command

593
00:50:54,542 --> 00:50:56,542
and missile launching stations.

594
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:59,792
Miss Dailey, would you press
this button here? The red one.

595
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:01,792
- The one in the middle?
- Yes, ma'am.

596
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:04,333
Oh, my God! It's the wrong one!

597
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:07,833
It's a joke! You didn't blow up anything.
Look what you did do.

598
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:10,750
"Distinguished visitors
from Birmingham."

599
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:42,292
Last week I had the governor
of New Jersey in this chair.

600
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:46,417
He said, "Colonel Thomas, why are we
at DEFCON 4?" as we are right now.

601
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:48,500
Why are we at DEFCON 4?

602
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:51,417
The Soviets saw our bombers scramble
and went on alert.

603
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:56,250
We told them it was just an exercise, but
we want them to relax their posture first.

604
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:57,583
Wait. Wait.

605
00:51:57,708 --> 00:52:00,083
- Give me that.
- Oh, Christ. Another tour group.

606
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:04,167
Just what we need today. Why don't they
go to Disneyland where they belong?

607
00:52:04,292 --> 00:52:08,292
- Well, I think they're going to tomorrow.
- OK. All set? Oh, here.

608
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,292
It was a one-in-a-million shot.

609
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:16,125
There was an open line
at our division in Sunnyvale.

610
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,167
The phone company screwed up!

611
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:21,208
- John. John McKittrick, George Wigan.
- How are you?

612
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,708
George is with the FBI.
He brought the kid in.

613
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:26,917
It looks like we've got
a high-school prank on our hands.

614
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:28,792
Paul, what happened?

615
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:33,542
The kid broke into the war game using a
password left by the original programmer.

616
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:35,167
- A password?
- Yes, sir.

617
00:52:35,292 --> 00:52:37,250
None of my team even knew it was there.

618
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:39,958
Kid claims
he was looking for a toy company.

619
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:43,208
That's great!
Anybody in here buy that one?

620
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:48,000
We can find the password and take it out,
but it might help to beef up security.

621
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:50,042
Oh. Beef up, huh?

622
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,167
How about screwed up?

623
00:52:52,292 --> 00:52:54,833
We did all that and he broke in again.

624
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:57,625
Kid says your computer called him.

625
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,250
What the hell is going on, John?

626
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:04,292
I woke up the president. I told him
we were under attack by the Russians.

627
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:08,417
You know what an idiot that makes me
look? Not to mention the general.

628
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:10,583
I think we're being a little naive here.

629
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,708
There is no way a high-school punk

630
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,708
can put a dime in a telephone
and break into our system.

631
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,042
He's got to be working
with somebody else.

632
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:21,833
He fits the profile perfectly.
He's intelligent, but an underachiever.

633
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:24,667
Alienated from his parents.
Has few friends.

634
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:27,167
Classic case
for recruitment by the Soviets.

635
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:29,875
What does this say
about the state of our country?

636
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,417
I mean, have you gotten any insight
as to why a bright boy like this

637
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:36,708
would jeopardies the lives of millions?

638
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:38,917
He says
he does this sort of thing for fun.

639
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:42,333
Dammit, John, I want some answers,
and I want 'em now!

640
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:49,167
- Let me talk to this little prick.
- I don't wanna talk. Just do it!

641
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,750
Come on, Paul.

642
00:53:56,292 --> 00:53:58,250
Who do they belong to? Do you know?

643
00:53:58,375 --> 00:53:59,750
What?

644
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:01,000
Good morning, sir.

645
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:04,125
- Where's the Lightman kid?
- In the infirmary, sir.

646
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:16,833
Hello, David. John McKittrick.
I run the computer facility here.

647
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:19,583
Sergeant, these aren't necessary,
the handcuffs?

648
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:21,042
No, sir.

649
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,292
Well, David, we called your parents.

650
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:27,625
We told them everything's fine.

651
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:30,542
No charges have been filed... yet.

652
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:35,208
But I think we are gonna need
a little time to sort things out here.

653
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,083
How much time?

654
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:40,458
Well, that depends on
how willing you are to cooperate.

655
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,583
Oh, of course.

656
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,917
Sergeant, would you tell the OD
I'm gonna take David for a little walk?

657
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:51,625
Let's go down to my office.
We'll be more comfortable there.

658
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,708
Go ahead.

659
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,958
You used to work with Stephen Falken?

660
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:02,542
I started as his assistant.
How d'you know?

661
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:05,833
I read an article you wrote with him
on poker and nuclear war.

662
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:08,333
Bluffing. Yeah,
that shook a few people up.

663
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:12,417
- He must have been pretty amazing.
- He's a brilliant man. A little flaky.

664
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:16,458
He never understood the practical uses
of his... of his work.

665
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:19,708
This machine over here
runs his game program.

666
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:20,833
Joshua.

667
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,917
Come here a minute, David.

668
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:28,792
See that sign up here? Up here?

669
00:55:28,917 --> 00:55:30,583
- Yeah.
- DEFCON.

670
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:33,875
That indicates
our current defense condition.

671
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,750
It should read DEFCON 5,
which means peace.

672
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:40,333
It's still on 4 because of
that little stunt you pulled.

673
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:44,667
Actually, if we hadn't caught it in time,
it might have gone to DEFCON 1 .

674
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:47,917
- You know what that means, David?
- No. What does that mean?

675
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,625
World War Ill.

676
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:51,833
Wow.

677
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,875
You broke into our system
just to play a game, right?

678
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,292
That's right. That's exactly right.

679
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:04,250
After the news, you must have
realized how serious it was.

680
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:06,625
- Why'd you do it again?
- I didn't do it again.

681
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:09,583
- I even threw the number away.
- They found it in the trash.

682
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:10,917
Joshua called me.

683
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:12,833
Hey!

684
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:15,208
Look at that! That's some setup.

685
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:18,458
- What did you say?
- This is some setup.

686
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,292
No, no. Before that.

687
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:22,375
Joshua called me.

688
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:26,000
David, machines don't call people.

689
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:29,333
Yours did.

690
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:34,917
Who are you going to Paris with?

691
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,000
Paris? Oh!

692
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,833
No... You don't understand.

693
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:42,333
You had reservations for two to Paris.

694
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:47,667
- Who are you working with?
- Nobody!

695
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:51,583
Why don't I believe you?

696
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,917
I don't think I should say anything else
until I talk to a lawyer.

697
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:02,458
I think we'd better forget
about the lawyer crap

698
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:05,042
until I get a few answers
out of you myself.

699
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:24,792
Are you gonna answer the phone?

700
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:29,875
Hello.

701
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,208
Yeah.

702
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:32,292
What?

703
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,958
All right. I'll be right down.

704
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:37,833
You stay here. Don't move.

705
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:50,417
What's going on?

706
00:57:50,542 --> 00:57:54,250
There's been a serious penetration
into our WOPR execution order file.

707
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:56,667
- What the hell's he sayin'?
- In English.

708
00:57:56,833 --> 00:58:00,083
I'll give it to you. Somebody got
into Mr McKittrick's system

709
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:02,833
and stole the codes
that'll launch our missiles.

710
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:06,625
There's no cause for alarm.
The system won't accept a launch code

711
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:10,292
unless we're at DEFCON 1 .
I can change those codes in an hour.

712
00:58:10,417 --> 00:58:11,792
Well, who did this?

713
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:14,792
I think the kid's working
with somebody on the outside.

714
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:19,292
I don't know what they're up to, but
I don't want our bombers on the ground.

715
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:22,500
Take us to DEFCON 3
and get SAC on the line.

716
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,958
- Where are you?
- Sir.

717
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:29,292
Get me an update on those subs. I wanna
know what those bastards are up to.

718
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:57,500
Joshua.

719
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:00,792
Greetings, Professor Falken.

720
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:04,833
Hello.

721
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,667
Are you still playing the game?

722
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:12,375
Of course. I should reach DEFCON 1

723
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,125
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.

724
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:20,583
Would you like to see
some projected kill ratios?

725
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,042
69% of the housing destroyed.

726
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:26,167
72 million people dead?

727
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:32,750
Is this a game

728
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:34,833
or is it real?

729
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:36,875
What's the difference?

730
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,083
Oh, wow.

731
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:42,250
You are a hard man to reach.

732
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:44,333
Could not find you in Seattle

733
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:49,042
and no terminal is in operation
at your classified address.

734
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:57,917
What classified address?

735
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:03,792
DOD pension files
indicate current mailing as:

736
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,208
Dr Robert Hume.

737
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:11,083
AKA Stephen W Falken.

738
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:17,833
5 Tall Cedar Road,
Goose island, Oregon 97...

739
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:21,792
Can I just talk to Mr McKittrick?
I think I know what's going on.

740
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:25,542
I'm escorting you to Denver
where you'll be placed under arrest,

741
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:28,458
- pending indictment for espionage.
- Espionage?!

742
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,000
Let me talk to him!
He's right over there.

743
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:35,083
- Get that bastard out of the war room!
- No! It's Joshua!

744
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:38,167
He's still playing the game!
He's gonna start a war!

745
01:00:38,292 --> 01:00:41,417
Hold him where you had him before.
We'll leave in a few minutes.

746
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:45,458
Call Falken. He'll tell you. Please,
call him. Please, call him. Call him!

747
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:47,958
What the hell's he doing in here anyway?

748
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:07,333
Some of the men told me
that you're quite a tennis player.

749
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,792
Patient's eyes are dilated, consistent
with use of marijuana and possibly PCP.

750
01:02:48,917 --> 01:02:52,667
Depending on what information you want,
there's a button to press.

751
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:55,667
Let's say I wanted to find out
how to hit a backhand.

752
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:58,125
I don't think I have the right program.

753
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,750
Excuse me. What do you want?

754
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:03,125
Bathroom. It's a long ride to Denver.

755
01:03:03,292 --> 01:03:05,250
Excuse me.

756
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:12,750
Please! Let me talk to Mr McKittrick.

757
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,833
You can't talk to anybody.
The FBI be here any minute.

758
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,292
- Do you have to take a leak or not?
- No.

759
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,583
- I'm working here.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

760
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:48,667
Stop it!

761
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:51,500
- You have pretty eyes.
- That's original.

762
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,792
I'll get the elevator.

763
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,875
- Sign in here?
- Yeah, get us all.

764
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:25,583
I heard they voted you
Miss Fine in 1979. Is that true?

765
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:27,667
Will you stop it?!

766
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:29,750
- Am I bothering you?
- Yes.

767
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:32,375
- Do you want me to leave?
- Yes.

768
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,708
I want this door open right now.

769
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:47,500
- How about getting on the phone?
- Is there a technician?

770
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:22,417
Hey, Scooter! Wait up.

771
01:06:23,542 --> 01:06:25,667
Come on, hurry it up. I'm late.

772
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,792
OK. I'll be right with you.

773
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:31,208
- I think it's jammed from inside.
- Come on.

774
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:35,708
David! Come on, David.
You're just making it harder on yourself.

775
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:40,250
OK.

776
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,333
Let's go.

777
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:52,583
Right this way, folks. I've been informed

778
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,000
that they're cleaning the floors
in the computer center.

779
01:06:56,125 --> 01:07:00,000
Don't want anyone to slip and hurt
themselves, so we'll end the tour here.

780
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:03,500
If I can ask you to board the bus
as quickly as possible,

781
01:07:04,292 --> 01:07:07,625
you'll have a complimentary beverage
waiting for each of you.

782
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,583
Hold it! What are you doing?

783
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:11,750
Got it. Here it comes.

784
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:17,875
- You kids think you own this place?
- Oh! I was... just looking around.

785
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,958
You're not supposed to leave the group.
So get back there!

786
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,750
OK. Excuse me.
Thank you very much, sir.

787
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,542
Out of the way.

788
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,042
Thank you. Careful there.

789
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:33,375
Take care. Watch your step.

790
01:07:33,542 --> 01:07:35,333
- Bye.
- Bye now.

791
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,875
Watch your step.

792
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,458
- Check everywhere. He can't be far.
- Move it, will you?

793
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,458
- Thanks.
- Take care.

794
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:37,542
Bye.

795
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:10,958
- What city, please?
- Goose island, Oregon, please.

796
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:15,667
The number for Dr Robert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road.

797
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:21,375
Checking under Dr. Robert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road,

798
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,250
I find no listing.

799
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:25,875
What does that mean?
He doesn't have a phone?

800
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,958
I'm sorry. I have no listing.

801
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:30,083
Oh, wait.

802
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:35,375
Falken. Dr Stephen Falken,
F-A-L-K-E-N, at the same address.

803
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,083
I find no listing
for a Dr Stephen Falken, F-A-L-K-E-N,

804
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:42,458
on Tall Cedar Road, Goose island.

805
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:44,458
Thank you.

806
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:01,125
Yeah?

807
01:11:01,292 --> 01:11:02,917
Jennifer? It's me. David.

808
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:04,750
- David?
- Yeah.

809
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:07,125
Listen, I'm in Colorado

810
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,458
and I need a really big favour.

811
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,833
- Can you lend me some money?
- What?

812
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:14,792
I need an airline ticket.
I'll pay you back when I can.

813
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:17,792
I need a ticket from Grand Junction,
Colorado to Oregon.

814
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:20,875
- Why? What's going on?
- I'll tell you all about it later.

815
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,167
David, what are you doing in Colorado?

816
01:11:23,292 --> 01:11:26,167
I went by your house.
Your parents were just freaked.

817
01:11:26,292 --> 01:11:29,375
There are men around from the FBI
asking questions.

818
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,458
I can't talk about it right now.

819
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:36,875
When you buy the ticket, tell them that
I'll pick it up in Grand Junction Airport.

820
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:38,875
David, what's happening?

821
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:43,125
I can't talk. I've gotta get off the phone.
Please, will you just do this for me?

822
01:11:47,417 --> 01:11:50,208
Punch up number five.
Let me see what you have.

823
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:55,125
22 Typhoon-class submarines
departing Petropavlovsk,

824
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:58,583
turning southbound at Nordkapp,
bearing 095 degrees.

825
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:00,875
Sergeant, I hope you like vodka.

826
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:05,292
Yes, sir. I just hope they don't make me
eat none of them damn fish eggs.

827
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,917
Give me an update...

828
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:15,792
Sir, the Soviets deny any increase
in their submarine deployment.

829
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:18,000
They wanna know
why we're provoking them.

830
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:20,958
They're full of shit.
We know they're down there.

831
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:23,667
I'm gonna blow their ass out of the water.

832
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:04,583
Surprise!

833
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:09,583
- What are you doing here?
- You didn't sound too good on the phone.

834
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:12,667
- You shouldn't have come. I'm in trouble.
- Why?

835
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:16,125
Is this because of
what you did with my grade?

836
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:25,833
You kids better hustle.
The ferry leaves any second.

837
01:13:25,917 --> 01:13:27,875
Thanks. Come on. We gotta run.

838
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:35,375
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! Whoa!
- Hold it, hold it!

839
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:47,625
If he's still alive,
why would the obituary say he's dead?

840
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,708
No, he's not dead. He left.

841
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:53,125
When they know too much,
they give 'em new identities.

842
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:56,208
- Anyway, the computer said so.
- Oh, the computer said so.

843
01:13:56,333 --> 01:14:00,500
The computer that's still playing
the games? It's the military's computer!

844
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:04,083
- Why wouldn't they know about it?
- They don't know about Joshua.

845
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:07,875
Falken knows about Joshua. He's
the only one who knows what it can do.

846
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:11,792
That computer is trying to win the game
that we asked it to play.

847
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:13,875
For real!

848
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:15,917
You don't even believe me!

849
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,958
David... David.

850
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:26,625
- He's not dead.
- I'm sorry.

851
01:14:30,042 --> 01:14:31,958
I believe you.

852
01:15:17,417 --> 01:15:19,125
Oh!

853
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,625
What was that?

854
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,375
I don't know.

855
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:31,458
Did you see that? There are still people
who won't believe they could fly.

856
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:33,667
The sky was once filled with them.

857
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:37,375
- I'm looking for Dr Robert Hume.
- Is either of you a paleontologist?

858
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,458
No. We're high-school students.

859
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:41,542
Oh... Pity.

860
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,375
Well, high-school students,

861
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,125
you're on my land and I didn't invite you.

862
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:48,208
But

863
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:50,583
aren't you Stephen Falken?

864
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:53,542
Now, listen carefully.

865
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,042
Path. Follow path.

866
01:15:56,917 --> 01:15:59,875
Gate. Open gate, through gate, close gate.

867
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:02,417
Last ferry 6.30, so run, run, run.

868
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:04,792
Wait! Wait.

869
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:06,875
I came because of Joshua.

870
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:51,375
Radar reports two unknown tracks are
penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone.

871
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:56,625
Confidence is high. Flight profile
suggests Soviet backfire bombers.

872
01:16:56,750 --> 01:17:01,042
I want a visual confirmation on that.
Scramble two F-16s out of Galena.

873
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:04,667
Go to DEFCON 2.

874
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:40,708
Crystal Palace, this is Delta Foxtrot 27.
I have negative radar contact.

875
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:42,917
Repeat, negative Soviet aircraft.

876
01:17:43,042 --> 01:17:46,000
27, this is Brass Hat.
They're right in front of you!

877
01:17:46,167 --> 01:17:48,125
You're almost on top of 'em.

878
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,708
Brass Hat, we got nothing on radar

879
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:52,833
and 40 miles visibility.

880
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:56,583
There's nothin' out there, General.
Just blue skies.

881
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:58,667
What the hell?!

882
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:11,583
- You haven't been listening.
- Yes, I have.

883
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:14,000
I loved it when you nuked Las Vegas.

884
01:18:14,125 --> 01:18:17,417
A suitably biblical ending for the place,
don't you think?

885
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:20,000
Are you gonna tell them
what Joshua's doing?

886
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:26,208
Now, children, come on over here.
I'm going to tell you a bedtime story.

887
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:28,542
Are you sitting comfortably?

888
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:30,500
Then I'll begin.

889
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:36,458
Once upon a time, there lived
a magnificent race of animals

890
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:39,583
who dominated the world
through age after age.

891
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:41,458
They ran and they swam

892
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,833
and they fought and they flew.

893
01:18:43,917 --> 01:18:47,833
Until suddenly,
quite recently, they disappeared.

894
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:52,083
Nature just gave up and started again.

895
01:18:52,792 --> 01:18:54,750
We weren't even apes then.

896
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:58,750
We were just these smart little rodents
hiding in the rocks.

897
01:18:58,875 --> 01:19:02,458
And when we go, nature will start again.

898
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:05,292
With the bees probably.

899
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:08,625
Nature knows when to give up, David.

900
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:10,708
I'm not giving up.

901
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:14,500
If Joshua tricks them
into launching an attack, it'll be your fault.

902
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:19,250
My fault? The whole point was
to find a way to practice nuclear war

903
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:21,333
without destroying ourselves.

904
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:25,167
To get the computers to learn from
mistakes we couldn't afford to make.

905
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:28,667
Except I never could get Joshua
to learn the most important lesson.

906
01:19:28,792 --> 01:19:30,125
What's that?

907
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:34,458
Futility. That there's a time
when you should just give up.

908
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:36,542
What kind of a lesson is that?

909
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:39,000
Did you ever play tic-tac-toe?

910
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:41,625
Yeah. Of course.

911
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,708
- But you don't any more?
- No.

912
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:44,917
Why?

913
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:48,667
Because it's a boring game.
It's always a tie.

914
01:19:48,792 --> 01:19:50,833
Exactly. There's no way to win.

915
01:19:50,917 --> 01:19:53,417
The game itself is pointless.

916
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:57,917
But back at the war room,
they believe you can win a nuclear war.

917
01:19:58,917 --> 01:20:01,542
That there can be acceptable losses.

918
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,750
So you gave up? Decided to play dead?

919
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:10,375
For security reasons,
they graciously arranged my death.

920
01:20:11,917 --> 01:20:14,042
Did you know that no land animal

921
01:20:14,167 --> 01:20:17,542
with a body weight of over 50lb
survived that age?

922
01:20:18,542 --> 01:20:21,417
Extinction is part of the natural order.

923
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:22,875
Bullshit!

924
01:20:24,417 --> 01:20:27,542
If we're extinguished, it's not natural.
It's just stupid!

925
01:20:27,667 --> 01:20:29,958
Oh, it's all right. I've planned ahead.

926
01:20:30,667 --> 01:20:33,458
We're just three miles
from a primary target.

927
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:36,500
A millisecond of brilliant light

928
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:38,292
and we're vaporised.

929
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:42,542
Much more fortunate than the millions
who'll wander sightless

930
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:45,042
through the smoldering aftermath.

931
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:48,750
We'll be spared the horror of survival.

932
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:51,792
I'm only 17 years old.

933
01:20:52,917 --> 01:20:54,708
I'm not ready to die yet.

934
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:56,875
You won't make a simple phone call?

935
01:20:58,917 --> 01:21:02,208
If the real Joshua was still alive,
your Joshua,

936
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:05,542
- you'd do it, wouldn't you?
- Look, we might gain a few years.

937
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:08,917
Perhaps time enough for you
to have a son and watch him die.

938
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:13,250
But humanity
planning its own destruction...

939
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,083
That a phone call won't stop.

940
01:21:16,792 --> 01:21:20,917
This is unreal! You don't care about death
cos you're already dead.

941
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:25,833
I know a lot about you.
I know you weren't always like this.

942
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:28,208
What was the last thing you cared about?

943
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:34,917
You've missed the last ferry.

944
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:45,542
You're welcome to stay.
You want to sleep on the floor?

945
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:51,875
Good night.

946
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:55,583
Let's get outta here.

947
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:08,458
Come on. We'll find a boat.
There's gotta be a boat.

948
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:29,000
Mr President, we've got 48 nuclear subs
closing on the United States.

949
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:32,542
And we've got 100,000 Soviet troops
massing in East Germany.

950
01:22:32,667 --> 01:22:35,708
We're monitoring their bombers
that are on alert. Yes, sir...

951
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:37,792
Well, that's a load of shit!

952
01:22:37,917 --> 01:22:39,417
No, sir. Not you.

953
01:22:39,542 --> 01:22:43,375
Yes, sir. We'll be in touch
as soon as the information changes.

954
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:47,625
Intelligence reports rumours of a new
Soviet bomber with Stealth capabilities.

955
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:51,375
It can project a false radar image
600 miles away from the real aircraft.

956
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,875
Christ! Now they got us chasing shadows.

957
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:07,625
I think I saw one.

958
01:23:12,042 --> 01:23:16,500
What kind of an asshole lives on an island
and he doesn't even have a boat?

959
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:19,625
Maybe we can swim for it.
How far do you think it is?

960
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,917
No. It's two or three miles.

961
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:23,917
At least. Maybe more.

962
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:26,750
- Well, what do you say? Let's go for it.
- No.

963
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,375
- Come on.
- No!

964
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,875
I can't swim.

965
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:32,417
You can't swim?

966
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:34,542
No. OK, Wonder Woman? I can't swim.

967
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:38,500
What kind of an asshole grows up
in Seattle and doesn't know how to swim?

968
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:40,708
I never got around to it, OK?

969
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:43,875
I always thought
there was gonna be plenty of time!

970
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:46,042
I'm sorry.

971
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:52,583
I wish I didn't know about any of this.

972
01:23:53,917 --> 01:23:56,708
I wish I was like
everybody else in the world.

973
01:23:57,458 --> 01:23:59,667
Then tomorrow it would just be over.

974
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,875
There wouldn't be any time to be sorry.

975
01:24:06,292 --> 01:24:08,250
About anything.

976
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,375
Oh, Jesus!

977
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,792
I really wanted to learn how to swim.

978
01:24:20,917 --> 01:24:22,875
I swear to God I did.

979
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:33,750
Did I tell you that next week

980
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,708
I was gonna be on TV?

981
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:39,042
You're kidding?

982
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:42,292
On that aerobics show
with some girls from my dad's class.

983
01:24:42,417 --> 01:24:44,292
A movie star.

984
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:46,333
Yeah!

985
01:24:46,458 --> 01:24:50,875
It's kinda stupid, huh? I mean, nobody
would have been watching me anyway.

986
01:24:50,958 --> 01:24:52,125
I would have.

987
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:12,292
Oh, Jesus!

988
01:25:12,417 --> 01:25:14,375
The bastard turned us in!

989
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,208
It's all right. Get in.

990
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:44,375
We have a launch detection.
We have a Soviet launch detection.

991
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,458
BMEWS has confirmed a massive attack.

992
01:26:46,583 --> 01:26:49,542
- Missile warning. No malfunction.
- Confidence is high.

993
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:52,792
- Cobra Dane, is this an exercise?
- This is not an exercise.

994
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:56,417
General, DPS is tracking
300 inbound Soviet ICBMs.

995
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:05,917
- Tell me this is one of your simulations.
- It's not, Jack.

996
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,625
All right. Flush the bombers.
Get the subs in launch mode.

997
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,583
We are at DEFCON 1 .

998
01:27:12,708 --> 01:27:13,667
DEFCON 1.

999
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,708
Major Lem, get me a report on the WOPR.

1000
01:27:22,708 --> 01:27:26,125
Initial attack profile
is a full-scale Soviet strike.

1001
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:30,083
WOPR is putting our losses
at 85 to 95% of the strategic forces.

1002
01:27:30,208 --> 01:27:32,583
What does WOPR recommend,
Mr McKittrick?

1003
01:27:32,708 --> 01:27:34,958
Full-scale retaliatory strike.

1004
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:38,750
I need some machine to tell me that?

1005
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:41,917
President's on his way
to join Airborne Command.

1006
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,708
We have to give launch option.

1007
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:47,375
- Has he spoken to the premier?
- The Russians deny everything.

1008
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,875
We have a Soviet submarine
launch detection.

1009
01:27:50,542 --> 01:27:53,750
Let's go into a launch mode.
Close up the mountain.

1010
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:03,750
This is Crystal Palace.
We're closing up the mountain.

1011
01:28:03,917 --> 01:28:06,875
After the gates are closed,
nobody gets in or out.

1012
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:15,250
Initiate internal power.

1013
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,333
Generators on and functioning.

1014
01:28:26,833 --> 01:28:28,792
External power disconnected.

1015
01:28:32,292 --> 01:28:34,250
Seal off ventilation shafts.

1016
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:36,125
Shaft locks sealed.

1017
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:42,750
The gate's closed!

1018
01:28:50,042 --> 01:28:51,917
Is everybody OK?

1019
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,500
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Run for it!

1020
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,708
The gate's gonna shut! Come on!

1021
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:01,792
Come on!

1022
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,458
Hold the door! Hold the door!

1023
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:21,375
Hold the goddamn door!

1024
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,958
Come on! Hurry!

1025
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:32,458
They're clear! They're clear!

1026
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:54,417
All units confirm weapons targeted
and ready. Awaiting launch codes.

1027
01:29:54,542 --> 01:29:56,500
We are in a launch mode.

1028
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:58,833
Major Lem, lock out changes.

1029
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,958
Roger. Lock out enabled.

1030
01:30:10,542 --> 01:30:12,458
All right. I'll call you back.

1031
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:14,917
Here!

1032
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:24,458
I don't know what you think
you can do here, Stephen.

1033
01:30:24,583 --> 01:30:28,083
John! Good to see you!
I see the wife still picks your ties.

1034
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,458
- What has this kid been telling you?
- How far has it gone?

1035
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:36,750
The president's ready for a counterstrike.
That's what we're recommending he do.

1036
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:41,958
- It's a bluff, John. Call it off.
- No, it's not a bluff. It's real.

1037
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:44,792
Hello, General Beringer? Stephen Falken.

1038
01:30:45,333 --> 01:30:48,208
Mr Falken, you picked
a hell of a day for a visit.

1039
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:52,500
General, what you see
on these screens up here is a fantasy.

1040
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:55,333
A computer-enhanced hallucination.

1041
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:58,625
Those blips are not real missiles.
They're phantoms.

1042
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:02,792
There's nothing to indicate a simulation.
Everything's working perfectly.

1043
01:31:02,917 --> 01:31:05,583
- Does it make any sense?
- Does what make any sense?

1044
01:31:05,708 --> 01:31:06,583
That!

1045
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:10,125
Look, I don't have time
for a conversation right now.

1046
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:13,583
General, are you prepared
to destroy the enemy?

1047
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:14,667
You betcha!

1048
01:31:14,792 --> 01:31:18,667
- Do you think they know that?
- I believe we've made that clear enough.

1049
01:31:18,792 --> 01:31:20,542
Then... don't.

1050
01:31:20,667 --> 01:31:23,583
Tell the president to ride out the attack.

1051
01:31:23,708 --> 01:31:25,875
Sir, they need a decision.

1052
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:30,125
General, do you really believe
that the enemy would attack

1053
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:33,458
without provocation,
using so many missiles and subs,

1054
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:36,875
so that we would have no choice
but to totally annihilate them?

1055
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:39,167
One minute and 30 seconds to impact.

1056
01:31:39,292 --> 01:31:41,958
General, you are listening to a machine.

1057
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:45,292
Do the world a favour
and don't act like one.

1058
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:52,375
One minute and 20 seconds to impact.

1059
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:05,000
Yes, Mr President.

1060
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:09,167
Sir, at this point in time, we cannot
positively confirm the inbounds.

1061
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:11,958
We have reason to believe
they may not exist.

1062
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:14,375
Yes, sir. That's affirmative.

1063
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:16,875
Yes, sir.

1064
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:18,208
I do, too.

1065
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:20,333
One minute to impact.

1066
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:23,042
Who's first and how soon?

1067
01:32:23,167 --> 01:32:26,042
Initial impact
in the 43rd Bomb Wing at Loring,

1068
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:29,208
319th at Grand Forks,
and Alaskan Air Command, Elmendorf.

1069
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:31,292
50 seconds to impact.

1070
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:34,375
Get me the senior controllers.
I wanna talk to 'em myself.

1071
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,542
All stations, this is Crystal Palace.

1072
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:39,375
Stand by for a message from Brass Hat.
Acknowledge.

1073
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:43,000
Elmendorf Air Force Base Operations.
Lieutenant Colonel Bowers.

1074
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:46,167
319th Bomb Wing Operations.
Colonel Chase.

1075
01:32:46,292 --> 01:32:51,333
Colonel, this is Loring Air Force Base.
The senior controller isn't here right now.

1076
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:53,417
That's all right. Who are you?

1077
01:32:53,583 --> 01:32:56,042
Sir, this is Airman Dougherty, sir.

1078
01:32:57,333 --> 01:32:59,500
This is General Beringer at NORAD.

1079
01:32:59,625 --> 01:33:01,583
Our current situation...

1080
01:33:02,625 --> 01:33:05,708
Men, we're currently tracking

1081
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:08,875
approximately 2,400 inbound
Soviet warheads.

1082
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:11,458
But at the moment
we cannot confirm this.

1083
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:14,083
I repeat, we cannot confirm this.

1084
01:33:14,208 --> 01:33:16,000
30 seconds to impact.

1085
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:20,625
We're right there with you guys.
We've taken all the steps we can.

1086
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:23,958
Stand by to launch missiles
at my command.

1087
01:33:31,208 --> 01:33:33,625
Stay on this channel as long as you can.

1088
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,667
We'll be standing by.

1089
01:33:35,792 --> 01:33:37,750
20 seconds to impact.

1090
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:49,708
Ten... nine...

1091
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:52,583
eight... seven...

1092
01:33:52,708 --> 01:33:54,042
six...

1093
01:33:54,167 --> 01:33:55,833
five...

1094
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:56,958
four...

1095
01:33:57,083 --> 01:33:58,375
three...

1096
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,708
two...

1097
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:01,792
one... Impact.

1098
01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:20,500
This is Crystal Palace. Are you still on?

1099
01:34:22,417 --> 01:34:26,625
This is Crystal Palace.
Are you still on? Anyone there?

1100
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:29,292
That's affirmative, sir.

1101
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:31,792
Yeah! We're here!

1102
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:35,375
- Jesus H Christ! We're still here!
- Our boards are showing impact.

1103
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:40,333
No, sir. No impact. We're alive and well.

1104
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:41,875
All right!

1105
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:43,750
All right!

1106
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:50,792
All right!

1107
01:34:56,958 --> 01:34:59,125
All right! Recall the bombers!

1108
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:01,333
Stand down the missiles!

1109
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:34,000
Joshua, what are you doing?

1110
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:39,458
COC, I need Dr McKittrick right away.

1111
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:42,542
- This is McKittrick.
- Sir, we got a problem.

1112
01:35:42,667 --> 01:35:44,792
WOPR's not letting me log back on.

1113
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:48,125
- I can't get in to stand down the missiles.
- Stand by.

1114
01:36:00,542 --> 01:36:02,083
Paul, this is McKittrick.

1115
01:36:02,208 --> 01:36:04,375
The WOPR's not letting us back in.

1116
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:07,917
I know. No one can get back on.
We're trying everything.

1117
01:36:08,042 --> 01:36:11,333
It's like the entire password file
has been wiped out.

1118
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:14,208
I tried that! Don't you think
I would have tried that?

1119
01:36:17,375 --> 01:36:19,125
What are those?

1120
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:21,208
Those are launch codes.

1121
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:23,333
What are they for?

1122
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:27,542
Joshua's trying to find the right codes
so he can launch the missiles himself.

1123
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:38,625
What's happening?

1124
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:41,125
The random number generators
aren't running.

1125
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:43,208
- Got anything?
- I'm still looking.

1126
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:45,917
I got no idea.
It could be coming from anywhere.

1127
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:50,000
Sir, you better get on the headset.

1128
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:52,917
Yeah?

1129
01:36:53,042 --> 01:36:57,875
General, the machine has locked us out.
It's sending random numbers to the silos.

1130
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,958
Codes. To launch the missiles.

1131
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Just unplug the goddamn thing!

1132
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:05,208
- Jesus Christ!
- That won't work, General.

1133
01:37:05,375 --> 01:37:08,583
It would interpret a shutdown
as the destruction of NORAD.

1134
01:37:08,708 --> 01:37:13,333
The computers in the silos would carry
out their last instructions. They'd launch.

1135
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:16,750
- Can't we disarm the missiles?
- Over a thousand of them?

1136
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:20,750
There's no time. At this rate
it'll hit the launch codes in 5.3 minutes.

1137
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:26,417
Mr McKittrick?
After very careful consideration, sir,

1138
01:37:26,542 --> 01:37:30,750
I have come to the conclusion
that your new defense system sucks.

1139
01:37:31,667 --> 01:37:34,417
I don't have to take that,
you pig-eyed sack of shit.

1140
01:37:34,542 --> 01:37:39,208
I was hoping for something a little better
than that from a man of your education.

1141
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:41,292
General, it's the president.

1142
01:37:46,042 --> 01:37:48,917
What do you...
What are you gonna tell him?

1143
01:37:50,042 --> 01:37:53,083
That I'm ordering our bombers
back to fail-safe.

1144
01:37:53,208 --> 01:37:56,167
We might have to go through
this thing after all.

1145
01:37:58,792 --> 01:37:59,750
Yes, sir.

1146
01:38:06,542 --> 01:38:09,958
He's got one. When he gets all ten,
he'll launch the missiles.

1147
01:38:10,042 --> 01:38:13,292
- Well, can't they get in and stop it?
- No. They can't.

1148
01:38:15,833 --> 01:38:18,625
They've taken out my password.

1149
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:21,542
- Well, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know. Do you?

1150
01:38:21,667 --> 01:38:24,875
I told you not to start
playing games with that thing.

1151
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:29,875
It's games.

1152
01:38:31,792 --> 01:38:33,917
- Games!
- Try it.

1153
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,500
- John, feed it a tapeworm.
- Too risky. It might smash the system.

1154
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:40,167
- Did the kid get in the back door?
- We took it out.

1155
01:38:40,292 --> 01:38:42,583
- Invade the deep logic.
- We hit a fire wall.

1156
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:45,708
If it wants to play a game, then play it.
Have it list games.

1157
01:38:45,875 --> 01:38:48,625
- For Christ's sake!
- He's played before.

1158
01:38:48,792 --> 01:38:51,000
- He can hardly do worse.
- Two numbers.

1159
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:53,917
I'd piss on a spark plug
if I thought it'd do any good.

1160
01:38:54,042 --> 01:38:56,583
- Let the boy in there, Major.
- List games.

1161
01:39:02,375 --> 01:39:03,958
Chess.

1162
01:39:10,917 --> 01:39:12,417
Three numbers locked in.

1163
01:39:12,542 --> 01:39:13,833
Poker.

1164
01:39:16,375 --> 01:39:19,750
Security system's
not gonna let anything through.

1165
01:39:22,042 --> 01:39:24,000
Global thermonuclear war.

1166
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:33,875
Four numbers.

1167
01:39:36,167 --> 01:39:38,500
Stephen, for Christ's sake. Do something.

1168
01:39:38,625 --> 01:39:40,917
- Come on, kid. Let's go.
- No. Try again.

1169
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:46,000
- Put the list back up.
- We already tried that.

1170
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:47,875
- Put it up!
- Yes, put it up.

1171
01:39:55,542 --> 01:39:58,333
- It's not on the list!
- What's not on the list?

1172
01:39:58,458 --> 01:40:00,292
Go ahead. It's got to be somewhere.

1173
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:06,167
Tic-tac-toe.

1174
01:40:12,042 --> 01:40:14,708
You're in. Order it to disarm the missiles.

1175
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:15,917
No! No.

1176
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:27,583
Five numbers. It's got half the code.

1177
01:40:29,083 --> 01:40:30,833
One.

1178
01:40:32,292 --> 01:40:34,208
- Put X in the center square.
- I know.

1179
01:40:44,917 --> 01:40:47,042
- Six up.
- There's no way you can win.

1180
01:40:47,167 --> 01:40:50,125
I know that. It doesn't. It hasn't learned.

1181
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:54,708
- Is there any way to make it play itself?
- Yes. Number of players zero.

1182
01:41:14,792 --> 01:41:16,125
Seven!

1183
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:18,750
Come on. Learn, goddamn it.

1184
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:32,167
Eight.

1185
01:41:32,292 --> 01:41:36,625
It must be caught in a loop. It's taking
power from the rest of the system.

1186
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:39,417
Nine numbers.

1187
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:46,042
Ten! It's got the code. It's going to launch.

1188
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:06,542
Colonel Conley, call SAC.
Get me a launch status report.

1189
01:42:09,042 --> 01:42:10,958
Major Davis, get me the president.

1190
01:42:42,542 --> 01:42:44,000
How you doin', Colonel?

1191
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:47,458
Land lines out of the mountain are dead.
I'm trying satellites.

1192
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:14,542
- What's it doing?
- It's learning.

1193
01:44:00,042 --> 01:44:02,625
Greetings, Professor Falken.

1194
01:44:11,208 --> 01:44:13,792
Hello, Joshua.

1195
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,292
Strange game.

1196
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:19,625
The only winning move is not to play.

1197
01:44:27,292 --> 01:44:30,458
How about a nice game of chess?

1198
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:09,000
Colonel Conley, take us to DEFCON 5.

1199
01:45:09,083 --> 01:45:11,042
Yes, sir.

1200
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:07,333
