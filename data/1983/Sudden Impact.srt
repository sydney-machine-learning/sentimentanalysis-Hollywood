1
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,270
All rise, please.

2
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,400
The Court of California
is now in session.

3
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,111
The Honorable Judge Lundstrom,
presiding.

4
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,532
Please be seated.

5
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:38,565
Mr. D'Ambrosia?
This case is a travesty!

6
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:43,778
You have no evidence whatsoever
linking the accused to the murder.

7
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:48,950
The gun found in his car was obtained
as the result of an illegal search.

8
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,829
In the eyes of the court
it does not exist.

9
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:57,459
The search was illegal
because Inspector Callahan...

10
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,878
...and this is an old story...

11
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:05,258
...did not have sufficient probable
cause for detaining Mr. Hawkins.

12
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,763
The gun is inadmissible and
the charges against the defendant...

13
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,849
...are dismissed!

14
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,226
Mr. D'Ambrosia...

15
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,940
...be assured that I will discuss
your case-preparation techniques...

16
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,610
...with the district attorney.

17
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,820
Bailiff, next!

18
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,937
How many times, Callahan?

19
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:03,274
You can't bust them
because you think they're dirty.

20
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,527
"Psychic" don't cut it.

21
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,637
Hey, Callahan.

22
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,811
Don't look so puked-out.
Better luck next time, fool.

23
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,527
Listen, punk.

24
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,738
To me, you're just dog shit,
you understand?

25
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,283
Many things can happen to dog shit.

26
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,035
It can be scraped up with a shovel.

27
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:00,415
It can dry up and blow away,
or be stepped on and squashed.

28
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,918
My advice:
Be careful where the dog shits you.

29
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,139
Class act, Callahan.

30
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,350
A real class act.

31
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,007
Loretta.

32
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,119
You did real good with that cop!

33
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:06,332
Now, I want everything.
Money, watches, rings, everything!

34
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,043
Quick! Move!

35
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,172
Come with me.
We'll have a little party!

36
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,141
What are you doing,
you pig-head sucker?

37
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:30,899
Every day for the last 10 years,
Loretta gives me a black coffee.

38
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,111
Today she gives me a black coffee,
but with sugar in it.

39
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,113
A lot of sugar.

40
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,699
I just came back to complain.

41
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,036
Now, you boys put those guns down.

42
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,456
Say what?

43
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:54,005
We're not just going
to let you walk out of here.

44
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,591
Who is "we," sucker?

45
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,261
Smith and Wesson...

46
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,971
...and me.

47
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,361
Go ahead...

48
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,613
...make my day.

49
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:34,189
Call D'Ambrosia in the D.A.'s office,
ask him if coffee is psychic.

50
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,204
- Ernie.
- What?

51
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:53,958
Look who's going into the hotel.
Is that who I think it is?

52
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,752
Shit!

53
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,754
Why me?

54
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,591
A nothing detail!
A lousy peeper tour!

55
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,676
So, what do we do now?

56
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,721
Call Captain Briggs, let him decide.

57
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,651
May I have your invitation, sir?

58
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,115
I don't understand,
Inspector Callahan.

59
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,791
You know the number
for San Francisco General?

60
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,042
Yes, I do.

61
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,754
Why don't you call,
have them send an ambulance?

62
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,257
Tell them there's two assholes...

63
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,969
...with multiple contusions
and sundry broken bones.

64
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,764
- Inspector Callahan.
- I want to talk to Threlkis.

65
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:54,018
At his granddaughter's wedding?
On what business?

66
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,898
- To help him catch the bouquet.
- They have harassment laws.

67
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,498
Sit down. Please.

68
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,084
Champagne? It's imported.

69
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,673
Men, like wine, should grow finer,
more civilized.

70
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:27,218
They should mellow,
become more worldly.

71
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,179
But not Callahan.

72
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:33,725
Callahan is the one constant
in an ever-changing universe.

73
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,438
Linda Doker?

74
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,150
Fished out of the bay a month ago.

75
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,236
Her breasts were slashed.
Her feet burned.

76
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,072
Her face smashed to a pulp.

77
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,950
I read about it.
A hooker.

78
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,578
A very expensive one.

79
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:58,917
In fact, her specialty was making
old scumbags mellow and worldly.

80
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:04,255
She had a special customer
who said lots of things.

81
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,633
You are a fool, Callahan.

82
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,804
She may have been clever
and written them down.

83
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,097
Maybe she made a copy of it.

84
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,477
Maybe she didn't tell
when she was being tortured.

85
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:22,565
What will the scumbag's bosses
say when they find out?

86
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,152
Or his family?

87
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,532
Maybe his ass is in a wringer.

88
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,701
You fucking...

89
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,047
Someone help us.

90
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,759
Call an ambulance.

91
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,310
Sorry, inspector, but captain...

92
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,562
What happened?

93
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,190
Someone grabbed their chest.
Must've seen the bill.

94
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,733
Oh, my God.

95
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,921
Stand back, please.

96
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,683
Harry, wait till you see this.

97
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,520
Some stiff got himself
a.38-caliber vasectomy.

98
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,772
Harry, you don't look so hot.

99
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,572
Bad night? All nookied out?

100
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:07,086
Gang hit? Screwed-up drug score?
Unlucky john?

101
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,464
Or an unhappy love affair?

102
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:13,259
Don't tell me this shit's
getting to you.

103
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:16,971
Not Harry Callahan. Say it ain't so.

104
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:21,976
No, this stuff isn't getting to me.
Shootings, knifings, beatings.

105
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:25,939
Old ladies getting bashed
for Social Security checks.

106
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,442
Teachers being thrown out of windows.

107
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:33,154
- That doesn't bother me a bit.
- Harry, take it easy.

108
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,741
Or this job, wading through
the scum of the city.

109
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:42,497
Being swept away by bigger and bigger
waves of corruption and red tape.

110
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,000
That doesn't bother me.
You know what does?

111
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,921
You know what makes me sick
to my stomach?

112
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,133
Watching you stuff your face
with hot dogs.

113
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,928
Nobody, I mean nobody,
puts ketchup on a hot dog.

114
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,597
What the hell you talking about?

115
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:05,562
Having our fingers in the holes and
the whole dike is crumbling around us.

116
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:10,567
Lt. Donnelly says to get your... self
to the commissioner's office.

117
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,402
Swell.

118
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:47,729
- Leah, can I speak with you?
- Jennifer, what marvelous timing.

119
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,357
I'm giving your work
the favorite positions.

120
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:55,236
I'm afraid you'll be wasting
good selling spots.

121
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,031
Nonsense.
They're the jewels of the exhibit.

122
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,658
Don't be discouraged
if they don't sell immediately.

123
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,162
They're intense. People need time
to get used to them.

124
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,207
I'm just getting used to them myself.

125
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:11,753
How can such a howl of anguish
come from such a sweet girl as you?

126
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,173
I'm leaving town.

127
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,050
- When?
- Today.

128
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,804
But you'll miss the exhibit,
the opening.

129
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,807
I'm better at painting
than receptions.

130
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:27,268
Can I give you an address
to send the paintings to?

131
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,272
Think positive. It's money
we'll send from the sales.

132
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:35,527
- Where are you going?
- North, to visit someone.

133
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,418
Look at the blond baby!

134
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,712
Mama, check it out.

135
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,174
How you doing?

136
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,930
She wants to play.

137
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,766
- Need a lift?
- Sure, baby.

138
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,061
Then shove a jack up your ass.

139
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,401
<i>Puta.</i>

140
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:26,953
In 30 years of police work,
this is the most outrageous...

141
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,873
...transgression of authority ever.

142
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:33,460
- What the hell were you doing?
- My job.

143
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:38,173
It's your job to harass and incite
an old man into a heart attack?

144
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,633
My job's to investigate homicide.

145
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:44,554
That old man is the
biggest crime lord in the West.

146
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,098
How did I know
he would vapor-lock?

147
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,641
You hoped he would.

148
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,479
The Doker case is mine.
It's stuck. I broke it loose.

149
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,273
- With threats and intimidation.
- Any way.

150
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,360
Are you aware...

151
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:03,364
...that you've destroyed
months of surveillance work?

152
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:07,202
Thousands of dollars.
Hundreds of man-hours.

153
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,956
Investigations is busting its ass
to build a case on Threlkis.

154
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:17,337
He would've snaked out of it.
Maybe we saved the taxpayers money.

155
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,507
I ought to bust your ass
down to Traffic.

156
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,301
Or better, kick it off the force.

157
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,347
You're a dinosaur, Callahan.
Your ideas don't fit today.

158
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,891
What ideas are these?

159
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,228
Murder's a crime,
it shouldn't be punished?

160
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,940
Don't lecture me, you son of a bitch.

161
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:40,527
You know who you're talking to?
You know my record?

162
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:44,113
You're a legend in your own
mind.

163
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,742
- Goddamn you, Callahan.
- Gentlemen, enough.

164
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:51,913
Inspector, your methods are
different. But you get results.

165
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:55,625
Often your successes
are more costly to the city...

166
00:22:55,834 --> 00:23:00,213
...in terms of publicity and
destruction than most failures.

167
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,633
The press will have a field day
with this fiasco.

168
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:09,347
There may be legal repercussions.
There could be attempts at retaliation.

169
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:13,226
I think the inspector
should take some time off.

170
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,187
You're suspending me?

171
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:20,191
I'm suggesting you vacation
until it's calm.

172
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,068
I'm not up for vacation.

173
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:26,614
Callahan, I'm not fencing with you.
Take a few days off.

174
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,576
Harry, a couple of days.

175
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,002
Think things over, Callahan.
Get with it.

176
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,546
It's a new ballgame these days.

177
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,633
Funny, I never thought of it
as a game.

178
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:07,822
I examined your sister Elizabeth,
and I tested her again.

179
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,116
There are no changes.

180
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:13,912
The computerized tomogram
shows no evidence...

181
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,206
...of chronic subdural hematoma.

182
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,625
Physically, she's in good shape.

183
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:23,129
She remains in a vegetative state
that we can't penetrate.

184
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:26,424
Not even a primitive startle response.

185
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,844
We'll keep trying,
we're always hopeful.

186
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,721
You should be too.

187
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,254
Hi, baby.

188
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,173
It's me.

189
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,136
Jen.

190
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,723
I missed you.

191
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:51,593
Beth?

192
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,138
I saw one of them.

193
00:25:56,598 --> 00:26:00,768
He just appeared on the street
in front of me.

194
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:06,608
At first I thought I was having
some horrible vision.

195
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,570
But no. He was there.

196
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,741
Older and uglier.

197
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,912
I followed him.

198
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,751
For days I watched him.

199
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,670
Then I bought a gun.

200
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,424
I followed him to a bar.

201
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,927
I let him pick me up.

202
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:38,306
Let him drive me to a deserted spot.

203
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,600
Let him think...

204
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:45,647
It was like I was outside myself.

205
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,733
Above me, looking down.

206
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:52,487
Then he touched me.

207
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,615
And I killed him.

208
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,705
Beth?

209
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,085
I love you.

210
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:58,733
- Hell of a way to have a night off.
- You in on the act?

211
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:02,028
No, for Christ's sake.
Back off a little.

212
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:06,032
I worry about your ass.
It'll be shot off or kicked out.

213
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:08,159
What else is new?

214
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:11,079
They're not a bunch of junkies.

215
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,707
To them, you killed Threlkis,
same as shooting him.

216
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:17,127
They'll keep coming after you.

217
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,754
Good, we'll know where they are.

218
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:24,217
You're incredible, Callahan.

219
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:27,554
You're also on vacation
as of right now.

220
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:32,267
- I'm not up for vacation.
- You are, I just put you up.

221
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:36,020
Go get some R and R
and stay out of trouble.

222
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:42,610
You hear me, Callahan?
Peace and quiet!

223
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:34,889
Good morning, Horace.

224
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:38,560
Sweet Sister Sadie,
where the hell did you get that?

225
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:42,063
I've had it a while.
Thought I'd get used to it.

226
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:46,276
I heard about the car.
Fabulous, coming after you in tanks.

227
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:51,865
Yeah, they're making those now, for
sheiks and business executives, hoods.

228
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:56,995
- Impregnable to anything but artillery.
- Well, you got that covered.

229
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:03,877
Not bad.

230
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:08,840
My ass! You have to strain
the remains for the fingerprints.

231
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,470
Well, this is the.44 Magnum Auto-Mag.

232
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,472
It has a 300-grain cartridge...

233
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:20,018
...and, if properly used,
it can remove the fingerprints.

234
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:38,411
I got just the place for you
to go on vacation.

235
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:41,414
- You got that wrong.
- You've no choice.

236
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,124
I think I do.

237
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,586
- You thinking about quitting?
- I might.

238
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:49,839
Look at the field.
Look what you did there.

239
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,800
Not quite good enough.

240
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:55,428
You can't quit, that's what.
Okay, jamf?

241
00:34:55,637 --> 00:35:00,558
What's the brass going to do?
Who are they going to complain to?

242
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:05,188
And the PR men kissing ass,
ass that you kicked.

243
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,607
You're nothing but a cop.

244
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:11,236
That's all you've been
and all you'll be, jamf.

245
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:12,612
Thank you, doctor.

246
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:17,742
Listen, when you get cut,
you'll bleed P.D. Blue, jamf.

247
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,327
What the hell's a "jamf"?

248
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,580
- That means you're a jive-ass mother...
- Forget I asked.

249
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,302
Almost there.

250
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,707
<i>I hope the house is suitable.</i>

251
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:08,793
It's a bit deserted out in West Cliff.

252
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:13,423
I thought you'd appreciate
the solitude as you seek inspiration.

253
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:15,008
The house is lovely.

254
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:20,263
I've left the fridge stocked for you.
And there's firewood for a fire.

255
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:22,891
Let's see, here are the keys...

256
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:26,603
...for the carousel house.

257
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:29,689
Everything you need should be here.

258
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:34,694
But if you have any additional wants,
we have an account in Dunstan's.

259
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,070
Thank you.

260
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:39,199
I can't tell you how happy we are...

261
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:43,453
...that you're doing this work
for the Historical Society.

262
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:49,083
Because your work is so impressive
and so impeccably authentic.

263
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,586
I do my research.

264
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:57,300
It must give you great satisfaction
to make old, ugly things right again.

265
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:04,808
Yes, sometimes it does.

266
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:52,707
Like what I brought you, baby?

267
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:08,181
I like you, yeah.

268
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:09,993
Tell him that you like it.

269
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:13,455
Don't forget,
I get my shot at the other one.

270
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:15,415
Come on, Alby.

271
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,542
What are you, queer?

272
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:02,962
There he is.

273
00:41:03,421 --> 00:41:07,884
- We'll show you dog shit, Callahan!
- Come on. Let's go kick some ass.

274
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:49,068
There he is! We've got him!

275
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:24,187
That's your idea of rest and
recreation? What's wrong with you?

276
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:27,774
Briggs is berserk and
the commissioner's on my ass.

277
00:43:27,982 --> 00:43:29,359
I'm sorry to hear that.

278
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:31,820
Can't you do anything the easy way?

279
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:34,614
- Am I on the job or not?
- You are.

280
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:36,825
Good. Then I'll get to it.

281
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:38,868
It's not what you think.

282
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:42,747
Remember that cock-shot stiff
by the Cliff House?

283
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:46,417
He's been here a few years,
but in the shade.

284
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,672
He looks small-time,
but maybe he was never caught.

285
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,173
And?

286
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,760
He came from San Paulo,
born and raised.

287
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:59,848
I want you to go there
and find out about him.

288
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,227
- What is this crap?
- It's a murder case, Harry.

289
00:44:04,435 --> 00:44:07,856
- You're shipping me out?
- I'm doing you a favor.

290
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:10,191
You are a walking combat zone.

291
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,819
People seem to die around you.

292
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:15,655
I don't want civilians
taking the fall.

293
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:17,490
You want to work?
Fine.

294
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:21,202
You got your assignment.
Get the hell out of here.

295
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:26,291
Take all the time you need. Maybe
the salt air will agree with you.

296
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:29,752
Any comments?

297
00:44:33,256 --> 00:44:34,382
Swell.

298
00:45:58,091 --> 00:45:59,134
Freeze!

299
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:11,980
Around the corner!

300
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:53,021
What's the matter?
You trying to kill someone?

301
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:06,868
Excuse me.

302
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:33,603
Police officer in pursuit
of a robbery suspect.

303
00:47:33,812 --> 00:47:36,856
- Shag his ass!
- Get that sucker!

304
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:39,526
Nail that son of a bitch!

305
00:48:16,729 --> 00:48:18,731
Is he all right?

306
00:48:21,484 --> 00:48:24,863
I guess I'd better
read you your rights.

307
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:33,538
Best damn day trip I've had
since they put me in that home.

308
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:37,125
Holy mackerel.

309
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,838
So, you're the famous Harry Callahan.

310
00:48:43,506 --> 00:48:47,719
I'll make this short and sweet.
I'll only say it once.

311
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:53,558
We don't need a hotshot to show
us dumb yokels how to do our business.

312
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:59,814
We know how to do our business,
so you keep your nose out of it.

313
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:01,608
You read me, Harry?

314
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:05,195
Aye, aye, sir.

315
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,570
Easy, boy.

316
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:08,424
Horace, you son of a bitch.

317
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:16,933
Swell.

318
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:09,277
Damn, Meathead.

319
00:51:09,944 --> 00:51:11,362
What did you call me?

320
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:15,033
I was talking to the dog.

321
00:51:17,702 --> 00:51:19,370
- Is that your dog?
- Yes.

322
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:22,457
Why? Do you want him?

323
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:26,336
If you can't control him, get a leash.
There are laws.

324
00:51:26,544 --> 00:51:27,879
Quiet!

325
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:34,636
You seem to be all right.

326
00:51:34,969 --> 00:51:38,306
I'm fine,
but you'd better get it together.

327
00:51:44,854 --> 00:51:45,980
Quiet!

328
00:51:51,444 --> 00:51:52,904
This way, inspector.

329
00:51:57,075 --> 00:51:59,369
This is it, inspector.

330
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,998
The coffee room and john
are down the hall.

331
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:07,293
If that's all, I'll get back to work.

332
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:11,714
Nice work yesterday, inspector.

333
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:15,009
It was me. You saved my life.

334
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:17,095
Thanks.

335
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:21,224
Right.

336
00:52:21,432 --> 00:52:23,351
If there is anything...

337
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,831
- Can I help you?
- Draft.

338
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:06,019
My game! My game!
You son of a bitch.

339
00:53:06,227 --> 00:53:11,357
Come on, dickhead, fork over the bucks
before I kick your nuts up your nose!

340
00:53:11,566 --> 00:53:14,861
I don't have any bucks, Ray.
I pissed it away.

341
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:27,373
And you? Pull something from
your pants besides your wet string.

342
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:30,877
I ain't got much.
We've been here all day...

343
00:53:31,085 --> 00:53:33,838
...and they won't run us no more tab.

344
00:53:34,172 --> 00:53:38,760
Give me it, twat-lips, or
I'll give your face its first period.

345
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:52,398
Want to go a couple of chugalugs
for some scratch?

346
00:53:53,316 --> 00:53:57,570
- What about us?
- Suck my ass with a straw!

347
00:53:59,697 --> 00:54:03,034
- How about it, Kruger?
- I'm out of here.

348
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:07,413
Shit, Kruger!
You're good for shit anymore.

349
00:54:07,622 --> 00:54:09,791
What's happened to you?

350
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,547
Hi, cutie.

351
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:20,844
- Want to buy me a drink?
- Not today.

352
00:54:24,764 --> 00:54:29,477
Come on, sailor. I know there's some
question you want to ask me.

353
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:32,439
Go ahead. You might get lucky.

354
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:35,567
Only with humans.

355
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,410
Shit!

356
00:54:50,748 --> 00:54:52,667
Looking for trouble, pal?

357
00:54:52,959 --> 00:54:55,712
Looking for friends
of George Wilburn's.

358
00:54:57,547 --> 00:54:59,966
- Are you a cop?
- What did he do?

359
00:55:00,216 --> 00:55:03,511
He lost his balls. He got killed.

360
00:58:38,143 --> 00:58:40,603
- Turn it off.
- What?

361
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,406
You don't remember, do you?

362
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:53,950
Remember what?

363
00:58:56,494 --> 00:58:59,581
My sister and I will never forget.

364
00:59:04,752 --> 00:59:06,004
One night...

365
00:59:06,504 --> 00:59:08,339
...long ago?

366
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,050
Under the boardwalk?

367
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:13,761
Remember?

368
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:20,078
Looks like I owe you one, Meathead.

369
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:59,075
- Inspector, what...?
- Where's Jannings?

370
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:04,122
Buckman Cove.
A fisherman discovered a body there.

371
01:01:05,373 --> 01:01:08,543
He personally checks up
on every corpse?

372
01:01:08,793 --> 01:01:12,422
No, sir.
But this was clearly a murder.

373
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:18,344
The victim was shot twice. Once in
the head, once in the genitals.

374
01:01:18,553 --> 01:01:20,722
We should go to the outer office.

375
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:23,141
You know anyone in this picture?

376
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,809
Not really.

377
01:01:25,018 --> 01:01:28,062
I think they're friends
of the chief's son.

378
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:29,355
And this girl?

379
01:01:31,566 --> 01:01:35,195
The dyke? Yeah.
Everybody knows Ray Parkins.

380
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:37,614
She's just a local. Why?

381
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:41,868
Looks familiar.
I thought I'd seen her somewhere.

382
01:01:42,076 --> 01:01:45,580
It's hard not to run across her
in San Paulo.

383
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:14,609
Why didn't you call me?

384
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:18,279
Who are you
that I should call you?

385
01:02:18,863 --> 01:02:21,866
What went on at your hotel
this morning?

386
01:02:22,408 --> 01:02:23,910
What do you think?

387
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,038
You tell me,
Mr. Big-City Inspector.

388
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:30,542
Everywhere you go,
somebody gets killed...

389
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:34,170
...and I don't like it.
And I don't like you.

390
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:37,757
So finish your research
and get out of my town.

391
01:02:38,007 --> 01:02:39,717
It's more than research.

392
01:02:39,926 --> 01:02:42,720
You're too stupid to realize that.

393
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:45,390
- Get out of here.
- The m.o.'s the same.

394
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:48,643
Ballistics will I.D. The bullet
as from the same gun.

395
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:53,022
You're not going to do anything
but get your ass out of here!

396
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:58,695
Right this damn minute or
I swear to Jesus I'll lock you up!

397
01:03:15,628 --> 01:03:18,715
I told you
I don't want you in my store.

398
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:22,635
I've got to talk to you,
you stuck-up asshole.

399
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:25,472
We've got nothing
to say to each other.

400
01:03:26,097 --> 01:03:27,307
You hear the radio?

401
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:30,351
Leave my store.

402
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:35,023
Kruger's dead.
They found him this morning.

403
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:39,652
He had his balls splattered
all over the front of his pants.

404
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:42,030
I don't care, Ray.

405
01:03:42,238 --> 01:03:46,034
Same thing happened to Wilburn
in San Francisco.

406
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:47,535
Wilburn?

407
01:03:48,286 --> 01:03:49,871
Remember him?

408
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:52,582
He's dead.

409
01:03:55,877 --> 01:03:58,213
That's twice I don't care.

410
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:02,801
Well, you better care, prick!

411
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:06,679
- I think she's come back.
- Who?

412
01:04:06,888 --> 01:04:10,517
Don't try to pretend with me,
you hypocritical shit!

413
01:04:10,725 --> 01:04:13,895
You dipped your wick
just like the others.

414
01:04:14,104 --> 01:04:16,564
You shut your mouth.

415
01:04:18,274 --> 01:04:20,819
You evil witch.

416
01:04:21,027 --> 01:04:24,906
What's the matter,
afraid somebody's going to hear?

417
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:29,702
Afraid you'll lose some of
your customers if they find out?

418
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:33,665
There's nothing to find out.

419
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:38,461
You make me want to puke!

420
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:45,552
I'm going to call Mick.

421
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:52,434
You do what you want, but keep that
psycho bastard away from me.

422
01:04:54,894 --> 01:04:57,021
I'll tell him you said that.

423
01:04:59,941 --> 01:05:02,652
Watch them real good!

424
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:06,406
And be prepared...

425
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:08,450
...boy scout.

426
01:05:38,855 --> 01:05:42,025
Now, see. Just like I told you.

427
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:45,361
Hurt me this time,
and it'll be your last.

428
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:50,200
Hurt you, babe?
What do you take me for?

429
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:55,205
- Let me up.
- Sure, babe, sure.

430
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,290
In a minute.

431
01:05:57,999 --> 01:06:00,001
Say it first.

432
01:06:02,462 --> 01:06:03,963
Say it!

433
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:05,590
- Mickey.
- Yes.

434
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:07,091
Baby...

435
01:06:07,675 --> 01:06:09,511
...you're so beautiful.

436
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:12,764
I want you, Mickey.

437
01:06:13,014 --> 01:06:16,476
- How bad do you want me?
- I want you bad.

438
01:06:17,018 --> 01:06:19,187
You're so strong.

439
01:06:20,438 --> 01:06:22,690
You're all a man should be.

440
01:06:22,941 --> 01:06:25,026
Baby, that's right.

441
01:06:25,693 --> 01:06:28,488
Keep talking, baby. Come on.

442
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:35,036
- Don't stop now, bitch!
- I can't! The phone!

443
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,212
Who the fuck is this?

444
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,215
Well...

445
01:06:47,882 --> 01:06:49,134
...how do?

446
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:52,971
Getting near my time to call you.

447
01:06:54,222 --> 01:06:56,307
I like it like this.

448
01:06:56,683 --> 01:07:01,312
Maybe we'll just keep it this way,
since you know how to find me.

449
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:10,488
That so?

450
01:07:12,615 --> 01:07:16,953
We'll just have to do something
about that, won't we?

451
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:40,059
Horace, do me a favor. Get me
the ballistics on the Wilburn killing?

452
01:07:40,268 --> 01:07:41,352
The what?

453
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:44,355
I got him.
Almost as ugly as you are.

454
01:07:44,564 --> 01:07:46,441
<i>He does have his good points.</i>

455
01:07:46,649 --> 01:07:49,194
Can you wire the report
in the morning?

456
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:53,531
You keep your ass covered
until I can get this arranged.

457
01:07:53,782 --> 01:07:54,991
Thanks.

458
01:08:14,302 --> 01:08:15,470
Kruger.

459
01:08:15,678 --> 01:08:16,930
Okay.

460
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:20,517
- If Chief Jannings finds out...
- He won't.

461
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:22,811
Just get me the information.

462
01:08:23,019 --> 01:08:25,772
Names, where they are,
where they work.

463
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,732
It's not easy, inspector.

464
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:30,944
I won't risk taking that photo
off his wall.

465
01:08:31,152 --> 01:08:34,614
One other thing,
could you get me Kruger's sheet?

466
01:08:35,281 --> 01:08:36,908
Anything else?

467
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:38,910
Just the address.

468
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:57,595
Mrs. Kruger?
Can I have a word with you?

469
01:08:57,804 --> 01:09:01,099
- You from the insurance company?
- No.

470
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:04,769
If you don't want fish,
get your ass out of here.

471
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:07,021
Mrs. Kruger, my name's Callahan.

472
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:09,774
You got shit in your ears, buddy?

473
01:09:11,693 --> 01:09:15,155
I'd like to ask a few questions
about your husband.

474
01:09:15,363 --> 01:09:19,242
That lousy son of a bitch?
He leaves me nothing.

475
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:24,330
I'm up to my ass in bills.
He let the insurance run out.

476
01:09:24,539 --> 01:09:27,375
Then he's killed
looking at dirty pictures...

477
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:30,962
...when he ain't touched me
in months, bastard.

478
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:35,175
Can't you see our sister's mourning?
Get out of here.

479
01:09:35,717 --> 01:09:38,470
Why don't you go suck
some fish heads?

480
01:09:55,487 --> 01:09:57,489
Don't even think about it.

481
01:10:08,792 --> 01:10:10,877
Well, I'll come back...

482
01:10:11,169 --> 01:10:13,379
...when you're less bereaved.

483
01:10:45,703 --> 01:10:47,413
You've come a long way.

484
01:10:48,706 --> 01:10:51,835
Somebody told us to get it together.

485
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:55,630
I have a feeling
you've heard that before.

486
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,882
Sorry if I was a little gruff...

487
01:10:58,091 --> 01:11:01,302
...but you and your friend
took me by surprise.

488
01:11:01,511 --> 01:11:04,347
Buy me a beer,
and we'll call it even.

489
01:11:06,015 --> 01:11:07,517
Stay, Meathead.

490
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:15,859
Waiter, a beer for Mr...?

491
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:17,652
Callahan.

492
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:21,072
- And another for me, please.
- Right away.

493
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,992
I'm Jennifer Spencer.

494
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:26,161
How's police business?

495
01:11:27,745 --> 01:11:29,789
What makes you think I'm a cop?

496
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:35,044
I saw the commotion. You're either
a cop or public enemy number one.

497
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:39,883
Some people might say both.

498
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:41,926
Really? Who?

499
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:46,473
Bozos with big brass nameplates
on their desks...

500
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:50,226
...and asses the shape
of the seats of their chairs.

501
01:11:50,935 --> 01:11:52,020
Why?

502
01:11:53,104 --> 01:11:56,524
It's a question of methods.
Everybody wants results...

503
01:11:56,733 --> 01:12:00,361
...but nobody wants to do
what they must to get them.

504
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:02,864
And you do?

505
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:05,658
I do what I have to.

506
01:12:06,701 --> 01:12:10,705
I'm glad, Callahan.
But you're an endangered species.

507
01:12:11,414 --> 01:12:15,460
It's the age of lapsed
responsibility and defeated justice.

508
01:12:15,752 --> 01:12:18,671
"Eye for an eye" means
"Only if you're caught."

509
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,384
Then it's an indefinite postponement
and "settle out of court."

510
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:26,846
Does that sound profound
or just boring?

511
01:12:28,556 --> 01:12:32,185
Sorry, I'm sure you get
that sort of thing often.

512
01:12:34,312 --> 01:12:36,397
No, I don't hear it enough.

513
01:12:37,857 --> 01:12:41,528
I promise to adjourn Philosophy 101.

514
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:55,375
- What do you do for a living?
- I paint.

515
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:57,794
Paint?

516
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:00,296
Houses, cars, what?

517
01:13:00,922 --> 01:13:02,006
Horses.

518
01:13:03,216 --> 01:13:04,384
Horses?

519
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:05,969
Hobbyhorses.

520
01:13:06,344 --> 01:13:08,847
I'm restoring the carousel here.

521
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:14,102
You don't seem like
a typical San Paulo policeman.

522
01:13:14,352 --> 01:13:15,603
I'm not.

523
01:13:15,895 --> 01:13:17,939
- Typical?
- San Paulo.

524
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:20,650
San Francisco P.D., Homicide.

525
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:28,408
Don't say this is your idea
of a vacation.

526
01:13:30,243 --> 01:13:32,412
No, I'm down here on a case.

527
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:35,331
Just gathering information in general.

528
01:13:35,832 --> 01:13:37,542
Anything interesting?

529
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:41,754
It's coming around.

530
01:13:43,506 --> 01:13:45,216
Got any theories?

531
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:50,472
Somebody's doing some killing
and I think it'll go on.

532
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:54,309
- A psycho?
- Probably.

533
01:13:55,769 --> 01:13:59,189
It could be somebody
just collecting on a debt.

534
01:14:00,231 --> 01:14:01,608
Revenge?

535
01:14:02,066 --> 01:14:05,695
The oldest motivation
known to mankind.

536
01:14:06,237 --> 01:14:08,281
You don't approve?

537
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:11,201
Till it breaks the law.

538
01:14:16,289 --> 01:14:19,083
Are you gonna want
another one of these?

539
01:14:19,459 --> 01:14:21,961
No, I work early.

540
01:14:22,212 --> 01:14:24,297
- I'll get that.
- No, no.

541
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:25,799
A deal's a deal.

542
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:31,513
- Good night.
- Good night.

543
01:14:31,721 --> 01:14:35,433
- Hey, is that your dog?
- Why, you want him?

544
01:14:41,314 --> 01:14:42,732
Swell.

545
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:19,454
The witch was right.

546
01:16:20,038 --> 01:16:21,539
It is you.

547
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:24,876
Put down the gun.

548
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:35,345
Now look, you've got to
understand something.

549
01:16:35,553 --> 01:16:39,808
That was a long time ago.
It was 10 years ago.

550
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:42,811
I was just a kid.

551
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:47,482
I didn't mean anything by it.
I know it was wrong...

552
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:49,943
...but I was drunk.

553
01:16:50,193 --> 01:16:52,695
I didn't even know what I was doing!

554
01:16:54,114 --> 01:16:58,451
I'm a businessman now.
I'm making money.

555
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:02,372
I can give you some of it.
You need money, right?

556
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:06,584
Please.

557
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:11,548
It wasn't my fault.
The others made me do it.

558
01:17:12,298 --> 01:17:14,300
Don't make me beg.

559
01:17:14,509 --> 01:17:19,931
It wasn't that bad, was it?
Not bad enough to kill me for.

560
01:17:20,515 --> 01:17:24,936
People sell it every day.
They give it away.

561
01:17:25,145 --> 01:17:28,648
Christ, don't.
Please.

562
01:17:29,065 --> 01:17:31,609
Don't shoot me.

563
01:18:10,106 --> 01:18:11,191
Come in.

564
01:18:12,817 --> 01:18:14,277
Close the door.

565
01:18:20,325 --> 01:18:21,409
Sit down.

566
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:32,921
It's for you.

567
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:44,265
What's going on? Jannings
has got the commissioner's ear.

568
01:18:44,974 --> 01:18:48,520
<i>He's a good guy.</i>
<i>Go easy with him, will you?</i>

569
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:52,857
<i>Harry, you don 't have</i>
<i>a hell of a lot of friends upstairs.</i>

570
01:18:53,858 --> 01:18:56,277
<i>Don 't screw yourself, okay?</i>

571
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:58,363
<i>Understand?</i>

572
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:01,908
No, I don't understand...

573
01:19:02,492 --> 01:19:03,785
...at all.

574
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:13,878
Here's the ballistic reports for
the Kruger and Wilburn killing.

575
01:19:14,879 --> 01:19:18,383
I think you'll find
they match up perfectly.

576
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:29,769
So that's the story, kid.

577
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:33,606
So our little college honey
is collecting dues?

578
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:35,900
You got it.
Heads up.

579
01:19:37,193 --> 01:19:40,697
- So, what are we going to do?
- We snuff her.

580
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:46,453
This town's got thousands of people.

581
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:52,000
Maybe she's not even staying here.
How do we find her?

582
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:54,335
We don't.

583
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:58,214
- What do you mean?
- We wait.

584
01:19:59,048 --> 01:20:02,594
She's coming after you, too,
sometime, right?

585
01:20:03,261 --> 01:20:04,471
I suppose.

586
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:06,639
And we'll be here.

587
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:10,101
Make her feel real welcome.

588
01:20:12,228 --> 01:20:14,647
What about Tyrone and Alby?

589
01:20:14,856 --> 01:20:19,402
I don't give a fuck about Tyrone.
And Alby's covered.

590
01:20:20,987 --> 01:20:26,075
How? The guy's a zombie. He doesn't
even know if he's pissing himself.

591
01:20:26,284 --> 01:20:27,869
He's covered.

592
01:20:29,829 --> 01:20:31,039
Okay.

593
01:21:05,865 --> 01:21:09,953
- You never give up, do you?
- It's my job, remember?

594
01:21:10,161 --> 01:21:12,664
What do you want from me, Callahan?

595
01:21:12,872 --> 01:21:16,084
Why are you delaying
this investigation?

596
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:18,336
Every available man's on the street.

597
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:22,298
We're logging more overtime
than the town can afford.

598
01:21:22,507 --> 01:21:24,092
We'll get that maniac.

599
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:29,431
- Do you think the killings are random?
- I reject no theory at this time.

600
01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:33,518
There's been no truth declared on the
muggings...

601
01:21:33,726 --> 01:21:37,063
...the burglaries,
the drunken driving.

602
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:41,317
All the less-headline-grabbing crimes
that we face everyday.

603
01:21:41,526 --> 01:21:43,945
Now, we're doing the best we can.

604
01:21:44,946 --> 01:21:47,282
Maybe that's not good enough.

605
01:21:47,866 --> 01:21:52,954
Callahan, this is not, repeat, not,
your jurisdiction, so stay out of it.

606
01:21:53,204 --> 01:21:54,372
I'm warning you.

607
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:59,544
Aren't you curious as to why I'm here?

608
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:03,358
Coming to the party I told you about?

609
01:23:03,566 --> 01:23:07,028
I can't. My sister's visiting.

610
01:23:07,403 --> 01:23:09,280
She a college girl, too?

611
01:23:09,697 --> 01:23:12,283
No, she's a junior in high school.

612
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:14,410
Bring her.

613
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:16,538
The more, the merrier.

614
01:23:17,705 --> 01:23:19,165
I don't think so.

615
01:23:20,917 --> 01:23:24,587
What's the matter?
Us locals not good enough for you?

616
01:23:25,547 --> 01:23:29,259
It's not that!
You don't understand.

617
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:33,680
All right, we'll come,
but we have to leave early.

618
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:36,558
Leave whenever you like.

619
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:38,643
Who knows?

620
01:23:39,769 --> 01:23:41,688
You may have a nice time.

621
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,385
It's Callahan.
Can I talk to Bennett?

622
01:24:54,594 --> 01:24:56,054
<i>I'll patch you through.</i>

623
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:01,810
<i>Bennett here.</i>

624
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:07,232
Bennett, would you run a plate for me?
1 -Adam-Queen-Ida-1-7-5.

625
01:25:07,941 --> 01:25:09,484
<i>All right, inspector.</i>

626
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:25,500
What the fuck are you doing?

627
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:28,628
- You fucking pig!
- Give me a little!

628
01:25:28,837 --> 01:25:30,880
Get your hands off of me!

629
01:25:31,089 --> 01:25:33,049
All I wanted was...

630
01:25:36,177 --> 01:25:38,430
Wait!
What the hell is this?

631
01:25:38,638 --> 01:25:41,266
Police officer.
I have a few questions.

632
01:25:42,392 --> 01:25:43,726
My ass!

633
01:25:50,942 --> 01:25:52,735
Get him, goddamn it!

634
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,530
Son of a bitch!

635
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:58,825
You bastard!
Knock it off!

636
01:25:59,033 --> 01:26:00,034
Stop it!

637
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:10,920
Now, you're coming downtown
and answering some questions.

638
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:15,508
Don't answer nothing, Mick!
Son of a bitch, I'll get a lawyer!

639
01:26:15,717 --> 01:26:18,845
He'll be out tomorrow,
you fucking bastard!

640
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:19,280
The bitch is here.

641
01:27:26,663 --> 01:27:27,997
So tell me.

642
01:27:29,499 --> 01:27:31,835
How's your slut sister?

643
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:57,735
Book him!

644
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:42,197
A little late for wave-watching,
isn't it?

645
01:28:44,324 --> 01:28:46,117
I couldn't sleep.

646
01:28:46,326 --> 01:28:48,369
- A beer?
- Thanks.

647
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:55,835
It's not safe to be out alone
after dark.

648
01:28:56,169 --> 01:28:59,297
Life is full of risks, isn't it?

649
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:07,680
I better go home.
Thanks for the beer.

650
01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:12,894
- Did you bicycle down here?
- No, I walked. It relaxes me.

651
01:29:13,103 --> 01:29:14,938
I'll give you a ride home.

652
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:17,357
No, that's all right.

653
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:20,026
It's okay, it relaxes me.

654
01:29:27,033 --> 01:29:28,284
This is it.

655
01:29:32,747 --> 01:29:35,125
Well, thanks for the lift.

656
01:29:38,169 --> 01:29:41,464
Want something stronger
to drink than beer?

657
01:29:42,048 --> 01:29:43,383
Come on in.

658
01:29:48,012 --> 01:29:49,848
I don't mind if I do.

659
01:30:02,444 --> 01:30:04,237
I'll get some brandy.

660
01:30:38,688 --> 01:30:40,106
Unusual.

661
01:30:43,276 --> 01:30:46,696
I have a rule.
Never drink with a critic.

662
01:30:51,868 --> 01:30:54,412
You want to be alone tonight?

663
01:30:57,499 --> 01:30:59,000
Neither do I.

664
01:32:36,556 --> 01:32:41,978
Harry, wake up, sucker. The heat's
off and we're going to celebrate.

665
01:32:53,156 --> 01:32:55,283
Well, well, well.

666
01:33:07,212 --> 01:33:10,340
Kiss your ass good-bye, Sambo.

667
01:33:42,705 --> 01:33:43,832
Bennett.

668
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:49,087
Bennett, send someone to Ray
Parkins' place. She's getting ripe.

669
01:33:49,295 --> 01:33:54,175
Bring that punk to the interrogation
room. I've got questions for him.

670
01:33:54,384 --> 01:33:57,262
Sorry, inspector, he's been released.

671
01:33:57,512 --> 01:33:58,596
<i>Who sprung him?</i>

672
01:33:58,805 --> 01:34:01,433
Kruger's brother-in-law picked him up.

673
01:34:01,724 --> 01:34:02,851
Swell.

674
01:34:03,059 --> 01:34:07,188
<i>Inspector, I'll get</i>
<i>that license plate number you wanted.</i>

675
01:34:07,397 --> 01:34:10,984
No, forget about that.
That turned out to be nothing.

676
01:34:11,192 --> 01:34:12,193
Thanks.

677
01:34:23,246 --> 01:34:27,876
I don't know where they are.
Just leave me alone!

678
01:34:44,392 --> 01:34:46,811
Hotshot cop.

679
01:34:48,563 --> 01:34:50,607
Your ass is mine!

680
01:35:38,363 --> 01:35:39,781
Mick, the gun!

681
01:35:45,078 --> 01:35:46,371
Cocksucker!

682
01:37:38,566 --> 01:37:39,859
Drop the gun.

683
01:37:59,963 --> 01:38:01,798
He couldn't live with it.

684
01:38:03,633 --> 01:38:05,468
The other vermin didn't care.

685
01:38:06,886 --> 01:38:09,722
But the guilt ate at his gut...

686
01:38:10,014 --> 01:38:11,599
...like an acid.

687
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:15,270
He actually wanted you to come back.

688
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:19,274
He used to sit, waiting,
praying that you'd come back.

689
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:25,155
One night
he couldn't wait any longer.

690
01:38:25,655 --> 01:38:30,577
He just got in his car and smashed
himself into a retaining wall.

691
01:38:31,286 --> 01:38:36,207
Now you're here
and he doesn't even know it.

692
01:38:37,917 --> 01:38:39,419
It's my fault.

693
01:38:40,503 --> 01:38:43,506
I should have let him
be punished then...

694
01:38:43,965 --> 01:38:46,134
...along with the other filth.

695
01:38:47,135 --> 01:38:51,014
He's my only child.
His mother died giving birth to him.

696
01:38:52,265 --> 01:38:54,768
We're all each other have.

697
01:38:55,727 --> 01:38:58,521
I was afraid for him.
I was afraid for me.

698
01:38:58,938 --> 01:39:03,109
You see, I was a public figure.

699
01:39:03,818 --> 01:39:04,903
So...

700
01:39:05,612 --> 01:39:07,489
...I did things. I fixed it.

701
01:39:08,948 --> 01:39:12,994
And now I want you to just go.

702
01:39:14,579 --> 01:39:16,664
Let it end.

703
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:20,627
There's one left.

704
01:39:22,796 --> 01:39:24,005
And I've got him...

705
01:39:25,048 --> 01:39:26,841
...in my jail.

706
01:39:27,092 --> 01:39:29,677
You just leave him to me.

707
01:39:29,886 --> 01:39:32,889
He's preyed on Alby and me ever since.

708
01:39:34,015 --> 01:39:36,684
That too is going to end.

709
01:39:37,685 --> 01:39:40,688
Is that so, Lester boy?

710
01:39:51,157 --> 01:39:53,785
Put down the piece, Lester.

711
01:39:54,077 --> 01:39:57,747
Or I'll splatter what's left
of the retard's brains...

712
01:39:57,956 --> 01:40:00,041
...all over the floor.

713
01:40:05,755 --> 01:40:06,965
Hi, babe.

714
01:40:12,178 --> 01:40:15,056
Is this what you had in mind for me?

715
01:40:46,755 --> 01:40:49,257
You almost fucked up here, Lester!

716
01:40:49,466 --> 01:40:52,844
But don't worry,
I'll take care of everything.

717
01:40:53,052 --> 01:40:58,349
And you won't have to do a damn thing
but sit on your fat ass.

718
01:41:00,977 --> 01:41:05,607
But first, me and the little babe
are going to relive some old times.

719
01:41:28,671 --> 01:41:32,759
Damn, Mick! You didn't say nothing
about doing the chief.

720
01:41:33,134 --> 01:41:35,804
Don't sweat it. It's a freebie.

721
01:41:36,971 --> 01:41:40,433
We just signed
our little honey's name to it.

722
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:56,825
Horace?

723
01:41:58,868 --> 01:42:00,620
Shit, man.

724
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:44,539
Hey, you remember this place, babe?

725
01:42:47,292 --> 01:42:50,253
Sure. You remember.

726
01:42:53,923 --> 01:42:58,803
I wonder if it's any better
after all these years.

727
01:43:02,974 --> 01:43:07,437
If there's anything left,
you boys can have a piece.

728
01:43:12,108 --> 01:43:15,445
Okay, you prickless scum!

729
01:43:15,653 --> 01:43:19,866
You want to try it again?
Think you can get it up this time?

730
01:43:20,074 --> 01:43:23,203
Think you can make it work this time?

731
01:43:23,828 --> 01:43:27,248
You want me, you filthy maggot?

732
01:43:27,457 --> 01:43:28,833
You take me!

733
01:43:29,042 --> 01:43:33,755
Because this time
you'll have to rape my dead body!

734
01:43:52,273 --> 01:43:53,316
No!

735
01:43:56,194 --> 01:43:58,154
The bitch is mine!

736
01:43:58,655 --> 01:44:00,281
All right.

737
01:44:22,637 --> 01:44:25,515
You lousy cunt!

738
01:44:39,404 --> 01:44:41,865
- You all right, Mick?
- Get her!

739
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:51,624
Get the bitch!

740
01:45:25,617 --> 01:45:26,659
Where is she?

741
01:46:01,194 --> 01:46:03,863
You ain't getting out of here.

742
01:47:47,133 --> 01:47:49,385
The door!
Get her!

743
01:47:57,894 --> 01:48:00,230
No you don't, sweetie.

744
01:48:10,115 --> 01:48:12,158
Holy shit!

745
01:51:04,497 --> 01:51:08,084
Come on, cop!
Come up and enjoy the party!

746
01:51:08,293 --> 01:51:12,255
We've got a class reunion
happening up here!

747
01:51:14,924 --> 01:51:17,302
Let the girl go, punk!

748
01:51:17,552 --> 01:51:21,931
Let my baby go?
I can't do that!

749
01:51:22,599 --> 01:51:24,267
This is my baby.

750
01:51:25,059 --> 01:51:27,103
This is my prize.

751
01:51:27,687 --> 01:51:30,523
Come on, cop!
You know I can't do that!

752
01:51:30,774 --> 01:51:32,942
I can't just let her go!

753
01:51:33,151 --> 01:51:35,862
Then it would be just you and me!

754
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:42,744
Come on, make my day.

755
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:48,166
That's not a bad idea, is it?

756
01:52:34,087 --> 01:52:35,922
What happens now?

757
01:52:39,217 --> 01:52:42,679
- I guess now I've got to...
- Read me my rights?

758
01:52:43,596 --> 01:52:46,015
What exactly are my rights?

759
01:52:46,391 --> 01:52:50,603
Where was the concern for my rights
when I was being beaten?

760
01:52:50,812 --> 01:52:54,774
What about my sister's rights
when she was brutalized?

761
01:52:55,233 --> 01:52:57,318
There's a thing called justice.

762
01:52:57,527 --> 01:53:01,364
And was it justice
that they should all walk away?

763
01:53:02,407 --> 01:53:04,909
You'll never understand, Callahan.

764
01:53:06,119 --> 01:53:09,372
Inspector,
we found a.38 snub in his belt.

765
01:53:18,923 --> 01:53:20,925
Run it through ballistics.

766
01:53:21,134 --> 01:53:25,013
I think you'll find his gun
was used in all the killings.

767
01:53:25,722 --> 01:53:27,432
Then it's over?

768
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:31,186
Yeah, it's over.

769
