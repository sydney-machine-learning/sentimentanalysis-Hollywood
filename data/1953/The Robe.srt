1
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:35,577
<i>Rome, master of the earth,</i>

2
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:38,664
<i>in the 18th year of the emperor Tiberius.</i>

3
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:42,667
<i>Our legions stand guard
on the boundaries of civilisation</i>

4
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,420
<i>from the foggy coasts of the northern seas
to the ancient rivers of Babylon,</i>

5
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:50,674
<i>the finest fighting machines in history.</i>

6
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:58,012
<i>The people of 30 lands send us tribute:
their gold and silk, ivory and frankincense,</i>

7
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:02,724
<i>and their proudest sons to be our slaves.</i>

8
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:07,144
<i>We have reached the point where there
are more slaves in Rome than citizens.</i>

9
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:10,481
<i>Some say we are only looters
of what others have created,</i>

10
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,816
<i>that we create nothing ourselves.</i>

11
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,736
<i>But we have made gods,
fine gods and goddesses,</i>

12
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,071
<i>who make love</i>

13
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:20,906
<i>and war.</i>

14
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,533
<i>Huntresses</i>

15
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,743
<i>and drunkards.</i>

16
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:30,414
<i>But the power lies not in their hands
of marble, but in ours of flesh.</i>

17
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:35,751
<i>We, the nobles of Rome, are free
to live only for our own pleasure.</i>

18
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:38,629
<i>Could any god offer us more?</i>

19
00:02:38,713 --> 00:02:41,047
<i>Today we traffic in human souls.</i>

20
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:46,677
<i>The slave market is crowded because the
emperor's heir and regent, young Caligula,</i>

21
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,429
<i>is coming to buy gladiators.</i>

22
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:52,432
<i>He probably will not be pleased to see me.</i>

23
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:17,327
Look here, look here. A singer, a dancer,

24
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,413
a companion for a noble lady,
or a noble gentleman.

25
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:25,292
Stop, gentlemen.
A priceless gem for your household.

26
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,252
Look here, look here. A singer, a dancer,

27
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:31,255
a companion for a noble lady
or a noble gentleman.

28
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:34,299
A physician from Egypt.
Question him if you like.

29
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:38,719
Stop and look. Stop and look.
A jewel, a jewel from the East.

30
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,889
You've heard of the beauty
of the Circassians. Look.

31
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:45,183
A beauty from Circassia. Stop and look.

32
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,517
Buy young and train them yourself.

33
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:50,938
Children grow into men and women.
These Goths grow strong.

34
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:54,357
Buy young. Buy young
and train them yourself.

35
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,236
Too old? Why, he's still got
ten or fifteen years left in him.

36
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,905
He costs no more than an ox,
and cheaper to feed.

37
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:06,367
A pair to touch the heart of any buyer.
A mother and child from Syria.

38
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,787
Buy them together. Buy them separately.
Smile. What's the matter with you?

39
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:14,998
Tribune. You came. I have them. Wait.

40
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:16,708
Girls. Girls.

41
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:19,669
Look. Two identical rubies. They're perfect.

42
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:23,589
And this one is a hairdresser.
She's an expert. Look at her hands.

43
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,926
- Very nice. Aren't they nice, Livia?
- Let go of me.

44
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,262
- I apologise for last night...
- Anything you say will be a lie.

45
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:34,348
Slave loose! Slave loose!

46
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:55,407
Thank you, Tribune.

47
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,577
A tribune. So today in Rome a tribune
does the vile work of a slave master.

48
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,663
Fool. Will you never learn? This is
Senator Gallio's son you're speaking to.

49
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:06,748
- Down on your...
- What's this? Tried it again?

50
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:11,670
Give me his slate. "Highborn, educated,
qualified for household steward. "

51
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:17,048
Sell him for lion bait. Put him up
as a gladiator. Never mind the price.

52
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:20,218
But, Cleander, Caligula's
buying gladiators today.

53
00:05:20,343 --> 00:05:23,304
- What of it?
- He'll get this Greek for nothing.

54
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:27,099
- He's worth 1,000 pieces of gold.
- He's worth his weight in dog's meat.

55
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:29,601
- Please.
- A gladiator. You heard me.

56
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:32,978
You animal. Animal!

57
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:36,273
Did you hear what he said? Lion bait.

58
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:42,195
- I'm sorry. What were you saying?
- There's nothing more to say.

59
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:45,530
After last night you'll never hear
another word out of me.

60
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:50,784
In front of my friends, too. I know you
were drunk as a pig, but that's no excuse.

61
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:54,913
Do you realise you've made me
the laughing stock of Rome, Marcellus?

62
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:57,290
Marcellus Gallio.

63
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:03,086
Don't think I won't talk about this.

64
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,671
- I intend to.
- Yes.

65
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,934
It's good to see you, Marcellus.

66
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:23,937
It's good to see you again.

67
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:26,730
Then you do remember me.

68
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:32,360
Yes, of course. Let me see now, it was the...

69
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:35,780
And your promise.
Have you forgotten that too?

70
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,532
What promise?

71
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,909
To marry me.

72
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:44,245
Was I drunk?

73
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:47,914
That's not very flattering, Marcellus.

74
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:53,126
If you'd tell me when I was supposed
to have said this - the circumstances.

75
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:58,631
I remember them perfectly.
I'd cut my finger, and I cried.

76
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:03,552
You took a dagger and cut your own finger
to show me that it didn't really hurt.

77
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:06,638
Then you kissed me and I stopped crying,

78
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:10,391
and then you promised
to marry me when we grew up.

79
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:13,393
Diana.

80
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:18,814
- Where have your freckles gone?
- I lost them.

81
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,359
- I loved every one of them.
- Then I'm sorry I lost them.

82
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,944
Let me look at you.

83
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:32,158
12 years... The gods must love Capri
to make you blossom so.

84
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:34,910
- What are you doing in Rome?
- Tiberius sent me.

85
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:37,830
Since my father died
I've been the ward of the emperor.

86
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:42,959
- Yes, this is Caligula's pavilion.
- Empress Julia thinks I'd be good for him.

87
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:45,169
Caligula? You can't.

88
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:49,298
He'll be emperor someday, and...
Would that matter, Marcellus, to you?

89
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:51,716
More than my life. After all, I promised you.

90
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:55,385
And you'll never know
how seriously I took your promise.

91
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:58,346
Do you intend to hold me to it, Diana?

92
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,725
I might. But I've heard
that you've made other promises since.

93
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:04,894
But only one vow to Diana.

94
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:15,360
He's coming, Marcellus. You'd better go.

95
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:20,281
Caligula and I have been in competition
before, and I've never lost to him.

96
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:24,409
- At least you're frank, Marcellus.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

97
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:27,036
Then all the tales I've heard of you are true.

98
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:31,707
- Every man makes enemies.
- All your enemies seem to be women.

99
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:34,626
Yes.

100
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:56,727
Begin the sale.

101
00:09:07,361 --> 00:09:11,030
And why is Tribune Gallio in my pavilion?
Does he seek a favour?

102
00:09:11,113 --> 00:09:15,951
I invited him, sire. We were friends
many years ago when we were children.

103
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,370
Buying today, or looking for amusement?

104
00:09:18,453 --> 00:09:21,372
Buying, I hope, sire. A pair of twins.

105
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:24,208
- Male or female?
- Female.

106
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,086
- Have them put up first.
- Sire.

107
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:34,091
No. Sit down, here with me.

108
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,885
You're very kind, sire.

109
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:41,346
The pleasure of our loyal tribune
is important to us.

110
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:45,600
You have such excellent taste.
These twins must be charming.

111
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:52,564
We have here two Macedonian twins,

112
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:57,317
trained as companions, entertainers,
servant for a highborn lady.

113
00:09:57,401 --> 00:10:01,321
Only once a year can their like
be found on the auction blocks of Rome.

114
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:03,781
They won't be sold separately.
What am I bid?

115
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:05,867
500 gold pieces.

116
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,617
1,000.

117
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:09,953
1200.

118
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:11,955
1300.

119
00:10:12,372 --> 00:10:14,707
- Don't lose them, Gallio.
- 1500.

120
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,918
1600.

121
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:23,005
- Marcellus, are you my friend or aren't you?
- Not to this extent.

122
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:26,967
- 2,000.
- The bid stands at 2,000 pieces of gold.

123
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:29,594
2500.

124
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:34,306
- You bid for yourself?
- No.

125
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,726
Sold for 2500.

126
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,605
Forgive me, Gallio, but I have
decided to give them to the lady Diana.

127
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:45,607
- But, sire...
- You wouldn't refuse me?

128
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:47,984
No, sire.

129
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:55,281
Offered as a gladiator, a Greek.
I guarantee his strength and fighting spirit.

130
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,992
- Buy him.
- 50 gold pieces.

131
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,994
- 50.
- Dog's meat!

132
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,414
There are no more bids. Get on with the sale.

133
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,457
100.

134
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,543
- You bid against me?
- Against Tribune Quintus.

135
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,129
- Be careful, Tribune.
- The Greek is well-qualified, sire.

136
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:16,173
- He's worth a better price.
- 200 gold pieces.

137
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:19,802
- 300.
- You want to make a gift of him to me?

138
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:22,053
No, sire. I want him.

139
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:24,555
And I bid against Quintus.

140
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:28,016
- 500.
- 700.

141
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:30,185
- 800.
- 900.

142
00:11:31,644 --> 00:11:33,938
1,000.

143
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:36,524
3,000.

144
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:41,069
The bid is 3,000 pieces of gold.

145
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:47,615
A little high, but I expected
to spend more on the twins.

146
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,619
You offend me, Tribune.

147
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:54,621
I think it's time you offend me no more.

148
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:57,707
Detail! March!

149
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:12,427
Sold to Tribune Gallio.

150
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:21,309
A wonderful purchase, sir,
even though you may have to beat him.

151
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:23,937
- Yes. Unchain him.
- Sir?

152
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,605
- Unchain him.
- But he's a dangerous man.

153
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,191
- Unchain him.
- Yes, sir.

154
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:38,824
What's your name?

155
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:41,200
Demetrius, from Corinth.

156
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:47,372
At the end of the street you'll find
the house of my father, Senator Gallio.

157
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:50,791
It has a scarlet door.
Report to the steward there.

158
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:13,685
There are times
when I'm away with Senator Gallio.

159
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,981
In that case, the slave attending
the front door is required to light the lamps.

160
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,652
To be a slave in this household
is an honour.

161
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:27,238
To be a slave anywhere is to be a dog.

162
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:31,992
The door. Open it. Remember to bow.

163
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:35,369
The door. Run, you fool.

164
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:39,664
- Good evening, Marcipor.
- Good evening, sir.

165
00:13:39,748 --> 00:13:41,166
It's you.

166
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:45,002
No household duties.
He'll be my personal attendant.

167
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:52,258
You could have run away. Why didn't you?

168
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:55,302
I owe you a debt, sir. I pay my debts.

169
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:59,139
- Not a slave's reason. More like a Roman's.
- A Greek's.

170
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:04,976
Yes, I know. In the great days of Greece,
we Romans were no more than barbarians.

171
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:10,231
Have Marcipor show you where I keep
my clothes. I'll change before dinner.

172
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:14,985
Good evening, Mother. Lucia.

173
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:17,529
Sorry, Mother, I was outbid for those twins.

174
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:20,031
- We know, Marcellus.
- Diana was here.

175
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:23,075
Diana? You should have
kept her till I got home.

176
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:26,869
Marcellus. She told us that
you and Caligula had a quarrel...

177
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:30,956
- Don't worry about that.
- Caligula's very angry.

178
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,500
- She takes him too seriously.
- She has to.

179
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,252
- She's going to marry him.
- Did she tell you that?

180
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:39,839
Mother, look. I think
he's in love with her himself.

181
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:45,385
Love's like wine. A sip hurts nobody, but
to empty the bottle is to invite a headache.

182
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,971
Well, you won't even get a taste.
She thinks you're very funny.

183
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,515
- She does?
- She thought you wanted the twins.

184
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:55,143
- Lucia.
- That's what she said, Mother.

185
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:02,023
Marcellus. Are you deliberately trying
to cut the ground from under my feet,

186
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:05,151
orjust too much of a fool
to understand what you've done?

187
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:07,820
You mean my difference
of opinion with Caligula?

188
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:12,240
I lead the senators who oppose him, and my
son makes fun of him at private banquets,

189
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:14,742
and now humiliates him in public.

190
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:18,370
I'm fighting for the republic
against the tyranny of the emperors.

191
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,663
- I know that.
- You know nothing.

192
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:22,915
Nothing but dice and women.

193
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:26,501
And now, by your behaviour
to Caligula, by these petty slights,

194
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:31,046
you cripple me, make my fight
look like a personal quarrel.

195
00:15:31,672 --> 00:15:34,591
- Yes?
- Sir, Tribune Quintus is at the door.

196
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:36,217
- For me?
- For your son.

197
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:38,803
- I'm not at home.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:47,727
Your leave. Give this to Tribune Gallio
when he does come home.

199
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:51,563
Well, aren't you going to read it?

200
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,732
After dinner.

201
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:56,108
Good eating to you.

202
00:15:57,777 --> 00:16:00,237
Ladies. Senator Gallio.

203
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:08,118
Quintus is a very important man.

204
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:10,204
He was already my enemy.

205
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:21,754
- May we know?
- It's from Caligula.

206
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:27,801
"The courage of a military tribune must not
be squandered in baths and banquet halls. "

207
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:30,386
"You are ordered
to the garrison at Jerusalem. "

208
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,640
- Jerusalem.
- "You sail tonight on the Palestine galley. "

209
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:40,686
That's all. Not even
an expression of his tender regard.

210
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:46,733
Cornelia, he will need his things.

211
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:51,612
Help your mother, Lucia.

212
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:03,038
Where's Jerusalem?

213
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,415
Palestine.

214
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,543
The worst pest-hole in the empire.

215
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:14,797
A stiff-necked, riotous people
always on the verge of rebellion.

216
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,552
Our legions there are the scum of the army,
the officers little better than the men.

217
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:22,137
Disease takes them off like flies.

218
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,515
Some have been assassinated,
sometimes by their own men.

219
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:29,727
Others have spared the assassins the trouble.

220
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:34,313
What Caligula hopes he has given you
is your death sentence.

221
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:39,067
- "We who are about to die"?
- Marcellus.

222
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:43,487
Marcellus, you are
the only son I'll ever have.

223
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,574
You know what my ambitions
have been for you.

224
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:50,285
I know how I've disappointed you.

225
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:52,953
Try to endure it, Marcellus.

226
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,205
Grow hard.

227
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:58,416
Watch the hand of the man
who walks behind you.

228
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:03,003
Drink in private and sleep
with your sword at your side.

229
00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:05,505
Take nothing on faith.

230
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:08,340
Bind yourself to no man.

231
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:12,053
Above all, be a Roman, my son,

232
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:14,971
and be a man of honour.

233
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:23,269
Perhaps there'll be amusement
in being a man of honour.

234
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:43,953
- Ready, sir?
- Yes, that's the last of my gear.

235
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:47,748
Ready at the oars.

236
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,918
Man the lines.

237
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:58,465
Careful with that, it's the wine.

238
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,175
Yes, sir.

239
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:04,345
There's no need to be so formal, Demetrius.

240
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,014
We'll both need friends where we're going.

241
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:12,267
Friends can't be bought, sir,
even for 3,000 pieces of gold.

242
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,187
Is there anything else you want, sir?

243
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,355
No.

244
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:24,277
The lady Diana begs a word with you, sir,
before you leave.

245
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:30,157
We don't want to lose this tide, sir.

246
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:42,667
Diana.

247
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,461
I came to tell you that I'm going back to Capri

248
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:48,255
to ask the emperor to intercede for you.

249
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,007
Why?

250
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:53,843
I think Caligula treated you unjustly.

251
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,178
Why, Diana?

252
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,805
It was partly my fault what happened.

253
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:01,182
The real reason.

254
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:07,062
Because I've found you again,
and I don't want to lose you.

255
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:12,191
Perhaps you don't believe that
a girl of 11 could fall in love

256
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,776
and stay in love all these years.

257
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:22,408
Tribune.

258
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:27,537
Don't cry, my love.

259
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:31,415
Lucia thought I was in love.

260
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:35,460
I laughed at her,
but women are wise in these matters.

261
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:40,964
Tribune. We'll miss the tide.

262
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,222
Make Tiberius promise
not to give you to Caligula

263
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:53,808
until I come back.

264
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:07,194
Cast off.

265
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:13,574
- Pull up.
- Lines are up.

266
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:16,243
Start the oars.

267
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:37,058
Jerusalem's no pleasure resort at its best.

268
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:40,770
This is the worst,
the feast they call the Passover.

269
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:44,231
This is when their soothsayers
tell them the Messiah will come.

270
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:48,443
- Messiah? What's that?
- King. Saviour. Redeemer.

271
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:52,030
Son of their god - and general troublemaker.

272
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,073
- He's coming here?
- No one knows.

273
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:57,366
No one knows if he even exists.

274
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,454
He is, but he isn't.
He hasn't come yet, but he's coming.

275
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:04,581
Every year the same.

276
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:08,417
You'll find out, Tribune,
if you live long enough.

277
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,045
Thanks for the kind wish, Centurion.

278
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:16,007
The Messiah.

279
00:23:17,383 --> 00:23:19,760
There he is.

280
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:37,816
What stirred them up?
Perhaps he's coming after all, the Messiah.

281
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,276
Something's happening, that's certain.

282
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,905
Look. There. Those people carrying palms.

283
00:23:44,614 --> 00:23:46,990
The man riding a white donkey. See him?

284
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:55,997
Flavius, clear us a path through these cattle.

285
00:24:33,194 --> 00:24:36,698
Demetrius, come along.
Your master will have you flogged.

286
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:38,740
- Did you see him?
- Who?

287
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:41,702
- The man who just rode past.
- I was over there.

288
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:44,787
He stopped here and looked at me.
He looked into my eyes.

289
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,206
- What did he want?
- I don't know.

290
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,126
I thought he was going to speak
but he didn't.

291
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:53,919
Only his eyes spoke.

292
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:56,839
Come on, Demetrius.

293
00:24:56,922 --> 00:24:59,215
I think he wants me to follow him.

294
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,676
- Who is he? A general?
- No.

295
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,637
- A king?
- No, he's not a king.

296
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:08,974
He's...

297
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:11,767
I don't know.

298
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,991
This is for the tribune. It's very important.

299
00:25:33,994 --> 00:25:36,370
Excuse me. Let me pass, please.

300
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,421
Here you are, Tribune, just as I promised you.

301
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,674
The finest Syrian wine
from the vintage you like the best.

302
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,635
And now, Tribune, there's
a little matter of payment.

303
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,887
One, two, three, four
skins of wine you owe me for.

304
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,598
Four skins of wine for four days, remember?

305
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:01,767
Who are you?

306
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,019
Who am I?
The tribune has a sense of humour.

307
00:26:05,102 --> 00:26:07,687
- He asks me who I am.
- Ever seen this man before?

308
00:26:07,771 --> 00:26:09,189
- No, never.
- Never, sire.

309
00:26:09,272 --> 00:26:14,109
Gentlemen, please. Please. I am Caleb,
Caleb the wine merchant. Remember?

310
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:17,571
I'm an honest man.
The tribune and I have an agreement.

311
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:20,365
A skin of wine every day.
Don't you remember?

312
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:23,158
Please, gentlemen.
I want my money. I'm a poor man.

313
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:25,577
You're not poor. You're as rich as Midas.

314
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:28,537
And you're not honest. You're a thief.

315
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,874
- Then you do recognise me.
- As for being a wine merchant...

316
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:35,168
The stuff you sell isn't fit for a jackass.

317
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:37,045
Thank you.

318
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,838
Oh, dear.

319
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:41,215
Tribune, what have you done?

320
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,226
Enjoying yourself?

321
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:58,271
Whoever conquered this land
should have been strung up.

322
00:26:58,354 --> 00:27:02,357
- Demetrius, pour us some of this poison.
- The curse of empire.

323
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,151
But think how we make it possible
for those in Rome to enjoy themselves.

324
00:27:06,235 --> 00:27:08,320
I am thinking about it.

325
00:27:08,404 --> 00:27:11,155
Pilate's given orders to arrest that fanatic.

326
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:13,449
Remember? The day you arrived?

327
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:15,909
Yes, the Messiah. What did he do?

328
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:18,620
He's been preaching,
stirring up a commotion.

329
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:21,122
- Why don't you arrest him?
- It's not easy.

330
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:25,167
Pilate wants it done quietly.
The man's got half the people on his side.

331
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:27,377
We've got to find out where he is at night.

332
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,631
And that is like finding
one particular ant in an ant hill.

333
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,927
Vinegar, like the rest of it. I hope you drown.

334
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,472
I don't care how you handle it, Centurion.

335
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:44,016
Just do your duty.

336
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:48,436
There's one way that never fails.
But it'll cost you some money.

337
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:51,439
Demetrius, how much is left in the purse?

338
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:56,610
- Eight gold pieces and some silver, sir.
- That should be enough.

339
00:27:56,693 --> 00:27:59,194
Give him the purse.

340
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:02,948
Give him the purse.
What's the matter with you?

341
00:28:08,702 --> 00:28:11,038
I'll report later. Tribune.

342
00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:14,999
Pour me some of that wine.

343
00:28:17,752 --> 00:28:19,836
Demetrius?

344
00:28:22,255 --> 00:28:23,965
Demetrius.

345
00:28:59,202 --> 00:29:01,453
Friend. Friend, could you help me?

346
00:29:01,536 --> 00:29:05,207
I'm looking for the carpenter
from Galilee, the one called Jesus.

347
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:09,252
- What do you want with him?
- I must warn him. I'm a slave like you are.

348
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:12,045
You're not even clever, you Roman spy.

349
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:22,679
Wait.

350
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:25,056
You. Stop.

351
00:30:03,254 --> 00:30:05,589
- I'm looking for the man called Jesus.
- Who?

352
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:09,426
- The one they say is the Messiah.
- I never heard of him.

353
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:43,453
Can you help me? I'm looking for a man.

354
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:47,831
- A man? What's his name?
- Jesus. I must warn him.

355
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:51,043
You're too late.
Even now he is before Pilate.

356
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:54,962
- They found him?
- He was betrayed to them,

357
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:57,464
and by one he loved and trusted.

358
00:30:57,547 --> 00:31:00,258
By his disciple, who sat at his left hand.

359
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:04,678
Why?

360
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:07,556
Because men are weak.

361
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,267
Because they are cursed
with envy and cowardice.

362
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:16,605
Because they can dream of truth,
but cannot live with it, they doubt.

363
00:31:17,356 --> 00:31:20,107
They doubt, the fools.

364
00:31:20,191 --> 00:31:23,319
Why must men betray
themselves with doubts?

365
00:31:24,236 --> 00:31:28,240
Tell them, the others. Find them
and tell them not to doubt.

366
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:31,367
Even now, not to doubt.

367
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:34,494
Tell them to keep their faith.

368
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:38,081
They must keep faith.

369
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:40,457
Wait. Tell who?

370
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,127
- Who are you?
- My name is Judas.

371
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,527
Tribune, wake up.

372
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,736
Come on. Do I have to drag you?

373
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,573
Duty calls, if the word
means anything to you.

374
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:22,116
- What is it?
- The governor wants you.

375
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:26,161
- At this hour?
- Come. Pilate doesn't like to be kept waiting.

376
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:44,301
Sir, I need your help.

377
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,345
Where's my helmet?

378
00:32:48,138 --> 00:32:52,391
- I spoke to you of the man Jesus.
- Yes, the fanatic.

379
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:56,394
- He's been arrested, sir.
- What do you expect me to do about it?

380
00:32:56,477 --> 00:32:59,813
Intercede for him.
Make them see that he's innocent.

381
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:03,525
No. When his trial comes up, I'll look into it.

382
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,736
What's he supposed to have done?

383
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:11,198
He's already been tried.
He's been condemned by Pilate himself.

384
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,325
- Pilate?
- You're going there, sir.

385
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,493
If he stains his hands with this blood,
he's a murderer.

386
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:20,914
That's enough. Pilate's the governor,
the Roman governor.

387
00:33:20,997 --> 00:33:23,499
As far as I'm concerned,
that ends the matter.

388
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:26,251
- As far as you're concerned, too.
- Ready?

389
00:33:26,335 --> 00:33:28,420
Yes.

390
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:35,634
For your own good,
you'd better forget you ever saw this man.

391
00:33:57,985 --> 00:34:03,365
- I don't like to be kept waiting, Tribune.
- I'm sorry, sir. I came as soon as I could.

392
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:05,742
I have special orders for you.

393
00:34:05,825 --> 00:34:08,452
You're to report to the emperor at Capri.

394
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:11,914
You must have powerful friends at court.

395
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,834
- I suppose I have, sir.
- There'll be a galley at the end of the week.

396
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,920
I have one task before you leave. It's routine.

397
00:34:20,003 --> 00:34:22,506
An execution. Today.

398
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:24,674
- Three criminals.
- Yes, sir.

399
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:29,803
One of them's a fanatic. He has a following.
There may be some trouble,

400
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:32,305
some attempt to interfere.

401
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,808
- Take enough men.
- I understand, sir.

402
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:41,229
I've had a miserable night. Factions,
no one agreeing with anyone else.

403
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,815
Even my wife had an opinion.

404
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:48,735
Good luck. I'm sorry to lose you.

405
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:53,865
- Thank you, sir.
- Give me water to wash my hands.

406
00:34:53,948 --> 00:34:56,867
- But you just washed them, my lord.
- Did I?

407
00:34:58,743 --> 00:35:01,036
So I did.

408
00:35:04,623 --> 00:35:07,417
Some wine before you go, gentlemen?

409
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,836
- No.
- You'd better.

410
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:13,380
- Your first crucifixion, isn't it?
- Yes.

411
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:17,258
What? Never driven nails into a man's flesh?

412
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:53,954
Hail our king. Our king.

413
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,633
Make way.

414
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:43,668
- Is it night?
- No.

415
00:37:43,751 --> 00:37:45,837
It's the middle of the day.

416
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,298
This isn't like other days.

417
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,436
17.

418
00:39:49,938 --> 00:39:52,231
Your go, Paulus.

419
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:58,945
Four.

420
00:39:59,988 --> 00:40:02,906
You're lucky today, Tribune. I'm finished.

421
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:06,742
- I'm always lucky.
- You. Bring me that robe.

422
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:11,122
- I have a proposition for you, Tribune.
- What?

423
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:13,498
You'll see.

424
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:38,935
- Hurry up.
- What's the matter with that slave?

425
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:43,397
- Where did you find him, Tribune?
- Throw the dice again, Paulus.

426
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:46,317
Mine by right of possession.

427
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:51,154
First-class homespun,
previously owned by a carpenter of Galilee.

428
00:40:51,905 --> 00:40:54,406
How much will you risk against it?

429
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,914
- 11.
- Tribune?

430
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,794
17.

431
00:41:08,877 --> 00:41:10,961
Lucky again.

432
00:41:13,172 --> 00:41:16,132
Tribune Gallio's first battle trophy,

433
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:18,843
for victory over the king of the Jews.

434
00:41:18,927 --> 00:41:22,012
We've done our duty, Centurion.
No need to joke about it.

435
00:41:22,096 --> 00:41:26,599
You can say that. You're going back
to Capri to kiss the emperor's hand.

436
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:29,769
I have to stay here in this sinkhole.

437
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:12,970
- Get back to your post.
- Let me go.

438
00:42:13,053 --> 00:42:16,098
- They say the storm's a judgment.
- Superstitious idiot.

439
00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:19,767
- They say he's the Son of God.
- Maybe he is. I don't know.

440
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:49,875
Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

441
00:43:53,426 --> 00:43:55,553
Throw that cloth over me.

442
00:43:55,637 --> 00:43:58,764
Didn't you hear me?
Throw that cloth over me.

443
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:07,355
Take it off.

444
00:44:07,563 --> 00:44:09,606
Take it off.

445
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:11,900
Take it off.

446
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:17,196
You crucified him.

447
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,697
You, my master.

448
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:22,325
But you've freed me.

449
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,786
I'll never serve you again, you Roman pig.

450
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:29,747
Masters of the world, you call yourselves.

451
00:44:30,498 --> 00:44:32,875
Thieves. Murderers.

452
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:36,002
Jungle animals.

453
00:44:36,086 --> 00:44:38,463
A curse on you.

454
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:41,590
A curse on your empire.

455
00:45:29,379 --> 00:45:31,673
There it is again, sir.

456
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:04,658
No.

457
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:19,420
No. No.

458
00:46:19,504 --> 00:46:22,005
Stop it. Stop it.

459
00:46:25,342 --> 00:46:27,802
Stop it. Why don't you stop it?

460
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:30,388
- Stop what, sir?
- Were you out there?

461
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:34,015
Out where, sir?

462
00:46:37,518 --> 00:46:39,770
I'm sorry.

463
00:46:39,853 --> 00:46:42,313
A nightmare.

464
00:46:42,397 --> 00:46:46,192
It must have been a nightmare.

465
00:46:52,697 --> 00:46:55,449
- We should put him in irons, sir.
- He's a tribune.

466
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:57,118
I don't care. He's dangerous.

467
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:01,705
If he asks me once more "Were you
out there?" in that tone of voice...

468
00:47:03,163 --> 00:47:05,666
I haven't slept since we left Joppa.

469
00:47:18,718 --> 00:47:20,803
My lady.

470
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:23,180
My lady, he is here.

471
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:48,909
What's wrong, Marcellus? You're ill.

472
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,414
- What is it? Let me help you.
- No one can help me.

473
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,876
It's enough that I'm with you again.

474
00:48:01,002 --> 00:48:03,087
Let's sit here.

475
00:48:10,677 --> 00:48:14,638
You can have no trouble so great
that I'd be afraid to share it.

476
00:48:14,722 --> 00:48:17,682
Ever since I went away
you've been in my heart.

477
00:48:17,766 --> 00:48:20,560
Your voice in my ears,
your image in my eyes.

478
00:48:21,144 --> 00:48:23,771
Waking and sleeping, you were with me.

479
00:48:23,854 --> 00:48:27,231
And even more, since it happened.

480
00:48:28,066 --> 00:48:30,985
- Since what happened?
- Every evening of the voyage,

481
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:35,155
a star appeared above the bow,
standing bright and steady in the sky,

482
00:48:35,238 --> 00:48:37,865
as if sent to guide the ship home.

483
00:48:38,908 --> 00:48:40,993
In my illness,

484
00:48:41,077 --> 00:48:43,578
I thought you had sent it as a sign.

485
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:48,916
It became my one link with sanity.

486
00:48:51,627 --> 00:48:54,128
Sanity? What do you mean?

487
00:49:08,015 --> 00:49:10,392
What is it, Marcellus? Tell me.

488
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:23,569
- Marcellus?
- Don't come near me.

489
00:49:23,653 --> 00:49:25,946
Keep away.

490
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:29,116
No, Marcellus. Don't.

491
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,495
My love, my poor love.

492
00:49:34,912 --> 00:49:36,996
Tell me.

493
00:49:37,622 --> 00:49:40,125
Soon enough you'll learn the truth.

494
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,335
I am ill, as you guessed.

495
00:49:44,878 --> 00:49:47,130
But in my mind.

496
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,425
The truth is, I'm mad.

497
00:49:58,889 --> 00:50:01,142
My lady?

498
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:04,894
- What is it?
- A message from the emperor.

499
00:50:04,978 --> 00:50:07,479
He'll see Tribune Gallio at once.

500
00:50:10,649 --> 00:50:12,734
Yes.

501
00:50:17,655 --> 00:50:22,701
- You can't go now, not till you've rested.
- It's no use. He already knows.

502
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:26,704
The captain of the galley ran to
report to him as soon as we docked.

503
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:28,872
I'll go with you.

504
00:50:28,955 --> 00:50:31,249
I can't ask you to.

505
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,126
But I want you to know

506
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:37,296
you're free from your promise.

507
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,276
Sire, Tribune Gallio is here
as you commanded.

508
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,444
But he was made ill by the voyage.

509
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:09,822
I beg you to postpone the audience
until he is rested.

510
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:15,160
- Does he ask for a postponement?
- No, sire, but I do. I implore you.

511
00:51:15,243 --> 00:51:18,371
It would serve no purpose.
I will see him now.

512
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:21,331
Bring him in.

513
00:51:21,414 --> 00:51:24,709
The lovely lady Diana married to an idiot.

514
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:28,379
But she's too good for Caligula, isn't she?

515
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,759
After 40 years with Julia,

516
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,928
my approaching death
holds few terrors for me.

517
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:42,473
Death, sire? But my last examination
proves you'll live for 20 years at least.

518
00:51:42,556 --> 00:51:46,143
- My physician is very loyal.
- Not 20, sire.

519
00:51:46,227 --> 00:51:49,604
30. I read it only last night
in the entrails of an owl.

520
00:51:49,688 --> 00:51:52,315
And my soothsayer even more loyal.

521
00:51:52,399 --> 00:51:54,775
The entrails of an owl.

522
00:51:54,858 --> 00:51:57,987
No, stay. We may have need
of you men of science.

523
00:51:58,611 --> 00:52:01,030
The entrails of an owl.

524
00:52:09,078 --> 00:52:12,289
- You are welcome, Tribune.
- Thank you, sire.

525
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,709
I bring you dispatches from Pontius Pilate.

526
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:19,878
By your leave, sire, he asked me
to put them into your hands and no others.

527
00:52:19,962 --> 00:52:22,214
Then they must hold bad news.

528
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:25,008
- Sit down, Tribune.
- Thank you, sire.

529
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:29,595
Tell me, what was your impression of Pilate?

530
00:52:31,179 --> 00:52:33,890
- It's not my place to...
- I'm asking you.

531
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:36,976
Did you find him capable?

532
00:52:37,184 --> 00:52:40,729
Yes, sire. He is considered
a good administrator.

533
00:52:40,812 --> 00:52:44,691
- Stern, as befits a Roman governor?
- I'm sure of that, sire.

534
00:52:45,442 --> 00:52:47,735
Just?

535
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,321
I can't say.

536
00:52:51,404 --> 00:52:55,158
Why not? Surely you can give me
some sort of an answer.

537
00:52:57,409 --> 00:53:00,996
Tell me, Tribune, what happened out there?

538
00:53:02,955 --> 00:53:07,000
- What happened?
- Were you out there?

539
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:09,628
Marcellus.

540
00:53:11,004 --> 00:53:13,922
I told you, sire, he's ill. Let me take...

541
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:19,594
Leave him alone. Stand back.

542
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:28,225
Tribune Gallio, you are a Roman officer.

543
00:53:28,434 --> 00:53:31,562
I command you to get control over yourself.

544
00:53:39,902 --> 00:53:42,196
Yes, sire.

545
00:53:43,572 --> 00:53:46,783
This report of Pilate's,
and your own condition,

546
00:53:46,866 --> 00:53:49,368
hint alike at a serious situation.

547
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:53,664
- Now speak.
- Please, Marcellus. He wants to help you.

548
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,918
I'm not your enemy, boy.

549
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:04,755
I fought in Iberia with your grandfather.
Your father was like a son to me.

550
00:54:05,172 --> 00:54:07,466
Now tell me. Everything.

551
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,193
Is Tribune Gallio still there?

552
00:54:31,277 --> 00:54:33,487
He's been talking for two hours, my lady.

553
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,115
- And?
- Hopeless, my lady. Completely hopeless.

554
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,164
The Son of God?

555
00:54:47,873 --> 00:54:50,376
What god?

556
00:54:50,459 --> 00:54:52,961
I don't know, sire.

557
00:54:53,044 --> 00:54:54,421
I don't know.

558
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:56,840
And you lost your wits
when he looked at you?

559
00:54:56,923 --> 00:54:58,132
No.

560
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:01,093
It was later, when I put on the robe.

561
00:55:04,887 --> 00:55:09,558
Miracles, disciples, slaves running away...

562
00:55:10,434 --> 00:55:14,645
Roman legionaries
fraternising with the natives...

563
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:18,065
Well, none of this
concerns us for the moment.

564
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:22,611
We must make you well.
What have you learned gentlemen to say?

565
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,237
A difficult matter, sire. Under my care...

566
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,282
- He'd never improve.
- Who gave you permission to speak?

567
00:55:28,365 --> 00:55:31,534
The clue to this man's sanity
is not in a vial of medicine.

568
00:55:31,618 --> 00:55:35,370
- Well, where then?
- In the robe that bewitched him.

569
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:41,417
- Go on.
- Plainly, there was a curse on the robe.

570
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,545
His only chance is to find it and destroy it.

571
00:55:45,587 --> 00:55:47,672
An interesting notion.

572
00:55:48,715 --> 00:55:52,426
He's right, sire. He must be right.
The robe was bewitched.

573
00:55:52,509 --> 00:55:56,471
- Let me find it, sire, destroy it.
- If you do, your mind will be restored.

574
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:59,807
A lost robe in the hands of a runaway slave?

575
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:02,601
- What chance would you have?
- He couldn't get away.

576
00:56:02,684 --> 00:56:07,313
He must be still in Palestine, with
the other followers of the dead man.

577
00:56:07,396 --> 00:56:10,149
He had disciples.
It's there in Pilate's message.

578
00:56:10,232 --> 00:56:13,193
Who knows what powers
he left to these disciples?

579
00:56:13,276 --> 00:56:15,779
Magic formulas, potions...

580
00:56:15,862 --> 00:56:18,697
- Beware.
- He is dead, Dodinius.

581
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:23,993
Evil never dies. It lives -
in the air, in the robe, everywhere.

582
00:56:25,536 --> 00:56:29,206
Tribune Gallio, I give you
an imperial commission.

583
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:33,125
For yourself, find this robe and destroy it.

584
00:56:33,751 --> 00:56:37,963
For Rome, seek out
the followers of this dead magician.

585
00:56:38,046 --> 00:56:39,923
I want names, Tribune.

586
00:56:40,006 --> 00:56:44,760
Names of all the disciples, of every man
and woman who subscribe to this treason.

587
00:56:44,843 --> 00:56:47,054
Names, Tribune. All of them.

588
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:50,473
No matter how much it costs
or how long it takes.

589
00:56:50,556 --> 00:56:52,809
You will report directly to me.

590
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:56,061
I understand, sire.

591
00:56:56,687 --> 00:56:59,522
- I am grateful.
- A galley will be put at your disposal.

592
00:56:59,605 --> 00:57:02,233
You will leave at once, on the first tide.

593
00:57:02,858 --> 00:57:05,151
That is all.

594
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:08,405
Thank you, sire.

595
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:13,784
Wait.

596
00:57:20,122 --> 00:57:24,751
For your sake, I interfered when
my wife wanted to give you to Caligula.

597
00:57:25,168 --> 00:57:29,130
For your sake, I brought your tribune
back from Palestine.

598
00:57:29,672 --> 00:57:32,507
For your sake, I now free you from him.

599
00:57:34,426 --> 00:57:38,095
But, sire, I have no wish to be free.

600
00:57:38,178 --> 00:57:40,180
Have you gone mad too?

601
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:44,183
He had everything then.

602
00:57:44,267 --> 00:57:46,643
He could have had me too.

603
00:57:46,727 --> 00:57:49,563
I wanted him,
but I wasn't sure that I loved him.

604
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,273
Now I am sure.

605
00:57:54,066 --> 00:57:57,193
I think it my duty
to forbid you to see him again.

606
00:57:57,277 --> 00:57:59,529
As a child, you were wise.

607
00:57:59,613 --> 00:58:02,406
Now you reason like a woman, foolishly.

608
00:58:04,909 --> 00:58:09,370
I can't help being a woman, sire,
but I try to reason as you taught me.

609
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:11,789
You were a soldier, sire.

610
00:58:11,873 --> 00:58:15,000
When you won, you could expect
your legions to cheer you.

611
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:17,753
But when you lost,
what would you have given

612
00:58:17,836 --> 00:58:23,215
to see the eagles raised in your honour,
to hear your name on every man's lips?

613
00:58:23,298 --> 00:58:26,384
I like Caligula no better than you do,

614
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:29,762
but what a wife
you would make for an emperor.

615
00:58:31,013 --> 00:58:34,974
Very well, my dear.
Your tribune shall have another chance.

616
00:58:35,725 --> 00:58:38,019
Thank you, sire.

617
00:58:52,405 --> 00:58:54,616
When it comes,

618
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:57,409
this is how it will start.

619
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:01,496
Some obscure martyr
in some forgotten province.

620
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:06,083
Then madness, infecting the legions,

621
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:09,127
rotting the empire,

622
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:11,504
then the finish of Rome.

623
00:59:11,587 --> 00:59:13,923
But if the tribune breaks the spell...

624
00:59:14,006 --> 00:59:16,258
Spell, you fool? What spell?

625
00:59:16,341 --> 00:59:21,054
This is more dangerous than any spell
your superstitious mind could dream of.

626
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:23,639
It is man's desire to be free.

627
00:59:24,473 --> 00:59:27,058
It is the greatest madness of them all.

628
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:32,563
And I have sent the most effective
physician I could find to cure it.

629
00:59:32,646 --> 00:59:35,148
I have sent a madman.

630
00:59:52,246 --> 00:59:54,497
Tribune. Tribune.

631
00:59:55,373 --> 00:59:59,918
- I warned you not to call me Tribune.
- Worthy merchant, then. I have news for you.

632
01:00:00,002 --> 01:00:03,130
When Abidor says
he'll find someone, he finds him.

633
01:00:03,213 --> 01:00:05,673
You found the Greek slave. Where is he?

634
01:00:05,756 --> 01:00:09,384
I haven't seen him, not myself.
But he is known, in this village.

635
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:14,054
- Cana, it's called. You'll find him soon.
- "Soon. " With you it's always "soon".

636
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:17,433
We've been to three provinces and
a hundred villages. Has he been seen?

637
01:00:17,516 --> 01:00:19,642
These villagers are suspicious.

638
01:00:19,726 --> 01:00:23,646
In this land of Galilee, the crucified one
has many friends, very many.

639
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:26,356
Names for your list, Tribune -
merchant, I mean.

640
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,026
And coins for me too, no?
A coin for every name.

641
01:00:29,109 --> 01:00:31,903
- The Greek. What about the Greek?
- He has been here.

642
01:00:31,986 --> 01:00:36,823
He is somewhere in Galilee now,
with one they call the big fisherman.

643
01:00:36,907 --> 01:00:39,910
- Fisherman?
- That's all I know. You'll find out the rest.

644
01:00:39,993 --> 01:00:43,078
The emperor's spy is cleverer
than a poor Syrian guide.

645
01:00:43,162 --> 01:00:47,415
I'll prepare the way for you. A Roman
merchant comes to trade for their homespun.

646
01:00:47,498 --> 01:00:49,584
Your gold will buy their answers.

647
01:00:49,667 --> 01:00:51,960
And their lives.

648
01:01:04,304 --> 01:01:06,681
Got any woollens? He'll buy them.

649
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:09,475
He wants all the homespun in Galilee.

650
01:01:09,558 --> 01:01:12,352
- Who is he?
- The Roman merchant.

651
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,562
He's paying well over market prices.

652
01:01:14,646 --> 01:01:20,025
Says homespun is coming into style in
Rome. The fine ladies dye it fancy colours.

653
01:01:20,108 --> 01:01:22,402
Maybe he'll buy this.

654
01:01:24,987 --> 01:01:27,740
Look what he paid me,
and there was a moth hole in it.

655
01:01:27,823 --> 01:01:31,785
I wouldn't have used that rag of mine
for a donkey blanket.

656
01:01:43,336 --> 01:01:45,420
Look.

657
01:01:51,634 --> 01:01:53,886
Wait.

658
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:56,638
You've paid more than you should have.

659
01:01:57,264 --> 01:01:59,349
Is this how we were taught?

660
01:01:59,432 --> 01:02:02,393
Do we pray to be washed of the sin of greed

661
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:07,272
only to close the book,
and cheat the stranger in our midst?

662
01:02:07,355 --> 01:02:12,025
Well, I'm not ashamed, Justus. This money
comes from the taxes that grind us down.

663
01:02:12,109 --> 01:02:14,778
Does one crime erase another?

664
01:02:14,862 --> 01:02:18,865
Friends, shall we turn dishonest
because life is hard?

665
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,036
I think you gave me too much.

666
01:02:56,145 --> 01:02:58,229
Thank you, friend.

667
01:02:58,313 --> 01:03:00,732
I hope you'll forgive my neighbours.

668
01:03:00,815 --> 01:03:04,818
I wasn't angry. A man is not cheated
when he's satisfied with the price.

669
01:03:04,902 --> 01:03:08,988
But you weren't the real loser.
They were only cheating themselves.

670
01:03:09,071 --> 01:03:11,157
Good day.

671
01:03:12,742 --> 01:03:14,826
Wait.

672
01:03:16,912 --> 01:03:20,664
I'd like to camp overnight here.
Can you suggest a place?

673
01:03:20,748 --> 01:03:23,042
I'd be glad to.

674
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,670
You seem to have great influence here.

675
01:03:27,754 --> 01:03:31,173
Well, when age speaks,
youth listens, sometimes.

676
01:03:31,256 --> 01:03:33,342
That's not what I mean.

677
01:03:33,425 --> 01:03:36,552
- Are you their leader?
- I'm only a weaver.

678
01:03:37,845 --> 01:03:42,140
Few travellers come to Cana.
What's the news from the great world?

679
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:48,312
The world's the same. But I've heard
that some new ideas have sprung up.

680
01:03:48,395 --> 01:03:50,480
Ideas are...

681
01:03:51,356 --> 01:03:54,817
Ideas are important. They grow like children.

682
01:03:55,776 --> 01:03:59,321
- Have you any children?
- Several. And a grandchild.

683
01:03:59,988 --> 01:04:04,909
We call him Jonathan, because he was born
with a crooked foot, like Jonathan of old.

684
01:04:04,992 --> 01:04:06,535
Jonathan of old?

685
01:04:06,618 --> 01:04:09,704
I don't suppose they teach
our history in Roman schools.

686
01:04:09,788 --> 01:04:11,872
- Jonathan.
- Yes?

687
01:04:12,957 --> 01:04:14,625
Wait for me.

688
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:17,877
- Didn't you tell me he was crippled?
- He's well now.

689
01:04:17,961 --> 01:04:20,338
Jonathan, this is...

690
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:24,299
Caius Marcellus. How are you, Jonathan?

691
01:04:24,383 --> 01:04:27,802
- I'm fine, thank you. Are these your donkeys?
- Yes.

692
01:04:27,885 --> 01:04:31,305
Behind this house there's
a good place to camp, and a well.

693
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:34,015
Jonathan, come along.
It's time for you to eat.

694
01:04:34,099 --> 01:04:37,519
- Already? It's early.
- Perhaps he would like a ride on a donkey.

695
01:04:37,602 --> 01:04:40,020
- May I?
- Of course.

696
01:04:40,104 --> 01:04:43,606
What's more, you can keep him.
From now on he's Jonathan's donkey.

697
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:46,442
- Mine?
- You are very generous, sir.

698
01:04:46,526 --> 01:04:48,944
No. I'm still in your debt.

699
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,905
Is he one of us, Grandfather?

700
01:04:52,197 --> 01:04:56,784
You are, or you wouldn't be giving things
away. Did Jesus tell you to do that?

701
01:04:56,868 --> 01:04:59,870
You must have known him.
He straightened my foot.

702
01:04:59,953 --> 01:05:02,038
- There you are.
- Go. Go.

703
01:05:02,122 --> 01:05:05,040
Fast, go. Grandfather, look, I'm riding.

704
01:05:05,124 --> 01:05:08,586
I'm riding my own donkey.
Look, everybody. He's mine.

705
01:05:08,669 --> 01:05:11,087
David, look. He's my donkey. Mine.

706
01:05:11,504 --> 01:05:14,965
Look, everybody. The man
down there gave him to me.

707
01:05:22,138 --> 01:05:25,307
Jesus used to live near here,
you know. In Nazareth.

708
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:27,851
Almost everyone in Cana knew him.

709
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:30,068
Now upon the first day of the week

710
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:35,155
Very early in the morning

711
01:06:35,614 --> 01:06:40,201
We came unto the sepulchre

712
01:06:40,785 --> 01:06:46,623
And found the stone rolled away, rolled away

713
01:06:47,874 --> 01:06:52,086
The great stone

714
01:06:52,503 --> 01:06:56,089
Was rolled away

715
01:06:56,798 --> 01:07:02,177
And we entered into the sepulchre

716
01:07:02,678 --> 01:07:10,351
And found not the body of Jesus

717
01:07:12,894 --> 01:07:20,860
And lo, a voice spake to us, saying:

718
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:29,533
"Why seek ye the living
among the dead, among the dead?"

719
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:38,623
"O seek not the living among the dead. "

720
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:44,503
"For he said unto you in Galilee

721
01:07:44,837 --> 01:07:49,090
The Son of Man must be delivered

722
01:07:49,174 --> 01:07:55,304
Into the hands of sinful men

723
01:07:56,889 --> 01:08:06,062
And be crucified and rise again, rise again. "

724
01:08:06,313 --> 01:08:12,985
"The Son of Man must rise again. "

725
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:20,073
And lo, Jesus appeared to us

726
01:08:20,449 --> 01:08:25,244
And showed us his wounds

727
01:08:25,661 --> 01:08:32,334
And he said unto us there:

728
01:08:32,918 --> 01:08:39,632
"Go ye therefore, the blessed

729
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:45,428
And teach all the nations. "

730
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:51,808
"And I am with you always. "

731
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:56,645
"I am with you. "

732
01:08:57,145 --> 01:09:03,317
"I am with you

733
01:09:03,943 --> 01:09:18,037
Even to the end of the world. "

734
01:09:43,142 --> 01:09:45,935
- Who is she?
- Her name is Miriam.

735
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:50,772
You've seen my grandson.
Miriam is another on whom Jesus looked.

736
01:09:51,481 --> 01:09:53,984
Another miracle?

737
01:09:54,067 --> 01:09:56,360
If you want to use the word.

738
01:09:56,444 --> 01:09:59,821
When she was 15,
she was struck down by paralysis.

739
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:04,200
It left her hopelessly crippled,
and hopelessly bitter about life.

740
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:10,080
She ate herself away with hate and consumed
everyone with her envy and malice.

741
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:21,756
- But she's still a cripple. She can't walk.
- No, she can't.

742
01:10:21,839 --> 01:10:24,383
If he was such a magician,
why didn't he cure her?

743
01:10:24,467 --> 01:10:26,551
He did.

744
01:10:26,634 --> 01:10:28,928
I don't understand.

745
01:10:29,512 --> 01:10:31,764
- Have you had supper?
- No.

746
01:10:31,847 --> 01:10:34,558
Perhaps you will honour my poor house.

747
01:10:36,268 --> 01:10:38,352
Thank you.

748
01:10:43,315 --> 01:10:46,276
Then one day there was
a wedding here in Cana.

749
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:50,112
The whole village took
part in it, all but Miriam.

750
01:10:50,738 --> 01:10:53,031
She stayed home and wept.

751
01:10:53,114 --> 01:10:57,701
A wedding, you see, when no man
would look at her and her twisted body.

752
01:10:58,202 --> 01:11:02,498
But when her parents returned to the house,
they found her, as she is now,

753
01:11:02,581 --> 01:11:05,291
as you saw her, smiling and singing.

754
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:08,460
Was Jesus at the wedding?

755
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:11,671
Yes. But he came late.

756
01:11:13,131 --> 01:11:16,050
So now she spends her time
singing fables about the man.

757
01:11:16,133 --> 01:11:18,385
But they're not fables.

758
01:11:18,469 --> 01:11:21,930
Surely you don't believe
that he rose from the dead?

759
01:11:22,013 --> 01:11:24,306
He lives more surely than we do.

760
01:11:24,389 --> 01:11:28,977
He's dead. And no moonstruck girl
can sing him back to life again.

761
01:11:30,269 --> 01:11:32,480
How do you know that he's dead?

762
01:11:35,732 --> 01:11:38,026
A soldier told me.

763
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:42,071
A soldier who saw
the lance thrust into his side.

764
01:11:44,115 --> 01:11:46,241
A soldier who was...

765
01:11:47,575 --> 01:11:49,160
who was out there!

766
01:11:49,244 --> 01:11:51,537
What's wrong?

767
01:11:52,913 --> 01:11:55,290
Were you out there?

768
01:11:55,706 --> 01:11:58,418
You're ill. Let me help you.

769
01:11:58,501 --> 01:12:01,086
No. Let me alone.

770
01:12:02,921 --> 01:12:06,257
Since the voyage, I've been indisposed.

771
01:12:09,176 --> 01:12:11,469
Forgive me.

772
01:12:31,111 --> 01:12:35,406
My master. These Romans drink
like pigs, but they pay well.

773
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:52,044
- What do you want?
- I have news.

774
01:12:52,128 --> 01:12:54,796
This pedlar outside is fresh from Jerusalem.

775
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:00,050
He says the governor has ordered the arrest
of all these fanatics called Christians.

776
01:13:00,134 --> 01:13:02,887
And for the leaders
they pay in gold, generously.

777
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:05,472
Justus is a leader, no?

778
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:10,100
I act under an imperial commission,
and I report to Tiberius, not to Pilate.

779
01:13:10,184 --> 01:13:13,437
Fine. You are a rich tribune.

780
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,439
But what harm is it if I get
a few extra coins out of this?

781
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:20,275
Justus on the cross is worth
a year of good wine to me.

782
01:13:28,074 --> 01:13:30,367
- Get back to Damascus, Abidor.
- But...

783
01:13:30,451 --> 01:13:32,535
Leave now. Tonight.

784
01:13:34,496 --> 01:13:38,499
You won't get rid of me
so easily, worthy merchant.

785
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:42,168
These Galileans are poor, but
they might pay well to know who you are.

786
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:47,297
And you are the man who crucified him.
You are his murderer, they are saying.

787
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,800
Stop! You are hurting me!

788
01:14:03,852 --> 01:14:06,146
Let's go. Come on.

789
01:14:06,647 --> 01:14:08,606
Kick him. Kick him.

790
01:14:08,689 --> 01:14:11,776
- Kick him harder. Let's go.
- I'm kicking.

791
01:14:11,859 --> 01:14:14,152
Go on, kick him. He'll go.

792
01:14:14,236 --> 01:14:17,531
Kick him, that's it. He'll go. Kick him.

793
01:14:17,614 --> 01:14:19,824
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

794
01:14:19,907 --> 01:14:21,992
- Kick him.
- Jonathan, isn't it?

795
01:14:22,076 --> 01:14:24,369
- Yes.
- Letting your friend have a ride?

796
01:14:24,452 --> 01:14:27,706
- No, I gave him the donkey.
- You gave him the donkey?

797
01:14:27,789 --> 01:14:32,793
- Did your grandfather tell you to do that?
- No, sir. I did it myself.

798
01:14:35,837 --> 01:14:38,339
Why are you so angry?

799
01:14:39,339 --> 01:14:41,425
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

800
01:14:42,467 --> 01:14:44,969
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

801
01:14:45,052 --> 01:14:47,888
I sit here so that I can watch people pass.

802
01:14:47,972 --> 01:14:51,349
Well, wouldn't you be angry?
I gave him the donkey for himself.

803
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:54,352
Then it doesn't matter what he does with it.

804
01:14:56,019 --> 01:14:57,604
I suppose not.

805
01:14:57,688 --> 01:15:00,149
Is it that you resent
what our master taught us?

806
01:15:00,231 --> 01:15:03,317
Why should I resent it?
He means nothing to me.

807
01:15:03,609 --> 01:15:06,319
Then why do you consider him your enemy?

808
01:15:08,488 --> 01:15:11,490
You see, we know
why you're here, Marcellus.

809
01:15:12,116 --> 01:15:17,704
It's simple, really. No merchant, even
a stupid one, would have paid those prices.

810
01:15:18,121 --> 01:15:20,915
And the look of you, those shoulders.

811
01:15:21,331 --> 01:15:23,834
We guessed at once what you were.

812
01:15:25,627 --> 01:15:29,005
Sit down, please, here in
the shade. The sun's hot.

813
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,845
Why must you do this, Marcellus?
Is it for Rome?

814
01:15:40,056 --> 01:15:42,308
Yes.

815
01:15:42,391 --> 01:15:45,810
And for myself, to save my reason.

816
01:15:47,728 --> 01:15:50,314
Justus said you were ill.

817
01:15:50,397 --> 01:15:52,066
- There's one who can help.
- No.

818
01:15:52,149 --> 01:15:55,943
- He was crucified. That was the end of him.
- That was the beginning.

819
01:15:56,027 --> 01:15:59,905
He's with his Father, but he left his word
with us and taught us how to use it.

820
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:02,741
Don't confess to sorcery.
You'll make things worse.

821
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:06,577
He was no sorcerer, Marcellus.
He cast no spells.

822
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:12,123
He only asked two things of us: "Love God",
he said, "and love ye one another. "

823
01:16:12,957 --> 01:16:18,170
And he meant not only the Jews, but
Romans and Greeks, slaves and soldiers,

824
01:16:18,587 --> 01:16:21,214
the strong and the weak, everyone.

825
01:16:21,714 --> 01:16:25,675
He asked us to build our lives
on this love, this charity.

826
01:16:26,218 --> 01:16:30,888
- To build a new world.
- Worlds are built on force, not charity.

827
01:16:30,971 --> 01:16:33,057
Power is all that counts.

828
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:37,185
Perhaps we have something
better than power. We have hope.

829
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:41,772
That you of all people should say that.

830
01:16:42,398 --> 01:16:44,525
What do you mean, Marcellus?

831
01:16:44,608 --> 01:16:48,611
You say he could work miracles,
but he left you as he found you.

832
01:16:48,695 --> 01:16:51,321
I used to wonder at that myself,

833
01:16:51,405 --> 01:16:53,949
until faith taught me the answer.

834
01:16:54,574 --> 01:16:59,954
He could have healed my body, and it would
have been natural for me to laugh and sing.

835
01:17:00,037 --> 01:17:04,958
And then I came to understand that
he had done something even better for me.

836
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:07,960
He'd chosen me for his work.

837
01:17:08,043 --> 01:17:11,839
He'd left me as I am so that all others like me

838
01:17:12,588 --> 01:17:18,427
might know that misfortune needn't deprive
them of happiness within his kingdom.

839
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,805
It's beyond reason that
anybody should think as you do.

840
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:27,518
If you had only known him,
looked into his eyes, heard him speak...

841
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,186
- I did.
- I don't understand.

842
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,939
Please. It's enough.

843
01:17:35,315 --> 01:17:37,776
You're in no danger from me.

844
01:17:38,193 --> 01:17:40,528
I'm leaving. Now.

845
01:17:40,611 --> 01:17:42,905
- We hoped you'd stay.
- Do you want to die?

846
01:17:42,989 --> 01:17:45,282
- Of course not.
- Then let me go.

847
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:48,577
No one's holding you, Marcellus.

848
01:17:52,038 --> 01:17:57,042
But a man came here this morning
I wanted you to meet, the big fisherman.

849
01:17:59,169 --> 01:18:01,754
- Fisherman?
- Simon the Galilean.

850
01:18:02,379 --> 01:18:04,840
The one Jesus called Peter.

851
01:18:07,091 --> 01:18:09,093
Did he come alone?

852
01:18:09,177 --> 01:18:12,596
No, he has a companion, a Greek.

853
01:18:12,679 --> 01:18:14,681
Where are they?

854
01:18:14,765 --> 01:18:18,059
At Shalum's inn. It's not far from here.

855
01:18:21,019 --> 01:18:23,313
Marcellus?

856
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:28,567
I don't know what's in your heart.
I've tried to tell you what's in mine.

857
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:32,195
But it's clear that you're troubled,
and I wish I could help you.

858
01:18:32,278 --> 01:18:35,907
Every man must find his own way,
but sometimes it's a comfort

859
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:39,868
to know that others, too,
have felt confused and lost.

860
01:18:40,285 --> 01:18:42,787
Don't lose heart, Marcellus.

861
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:46,916
The way is never easy,
but it's a path good men must take.

862
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:50,460
I hope you'll find yours.

863
01:19:08,474 --> 01:19:10,976
The Greek, Demetrius. Where is he?

864
01:19:11,477 --> 01:19:13,978
Up the stairs. The first door you see.

865
01:19:25,363 --> 01:19:28,074
Stand up in the presence of your master.

866
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:35,454
That robe. Where is it?

867
01:19:37,623 --> 01:19:39,916
The robe?

868
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:46,463
- Here.
- Keep away.

869
01:19:47,297 --> 01:19:49,383
Sir, you look ill.

870
01:19:49,466 --> 01:19:51,759
There. Burn it.

871
01:19:52,176 --> 01:19:54,470
- Why?
- It cast a spell on me.

872
01:19:54,554 --> 01:19:57,389
- It couldn't.
- I order you to burn it. Now.

873
01:19:57,472 --> 01:20:01,684
Why are you afraid of it? I'm not.
It brings me close to the one who wore it.

874
01:20:01,767 --> 01:20:04,186
I've ordered you to burn it.

875
01:20:04,854 --> 01:20:07,314
That you will have to do yourself.

876
01:20:09,441 --> 01:20:12,943
I'll have you whipped
and sold as a galley slave.

877
01:20:13,027 --> 01:20:15,195
I'll teach you who's master here.

878
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:17,572
I know who my master is.

879
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:24,286
You're afraid, but you don't
really know the reason why.

880
01:20:25,329 --> 01:20:28,205
You think it's his robe that made you ill.

881
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:31,709
But it's your own conscience,
your own decent shame.

882
01:20:31,792 --> 01:20:34,544
Even when you crucified him you felt it.

883
01:20:34,627 --> 01:20:37,589
The spell isn't in here,
it's in your heart and your mind.

884
01:20:37,672 --> 01:20:41,467
Face it, Marcellus. Don't be afraid of him.

885
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:43,968
He'd understand you.

886
01:20:44,052 --> 01:20:46,554
He had compassion for all men.

887
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:49,222
Marcellus.

888
01:20:49,306 --> 01:20:51,642
It was for your sake that he died.

889
01:20:51,725 --> 01:20:53,809
For the sake of all of us.

890
01:20:53,893 --> 01:20:56,187
No. No. No.

891
01:21:21,749 --> 01:21:24,168
I am not afraid.

892
01:21:27,754 --> 01:21:30,048
I'm not afraid.

893
01:21:36,761 --> 01:21:40,932
Until now, you only remembered
what you did to a man.

894
01:21:42,766 --> 01:21:45,185
The wrong, and your shame.

895
01:21:45,811 --> 01:21:49,689
But now you remember the man.

896
01:22:29,721 --> 01:22:32,015
Come, let me present you.

897
01:22:34,766 --> 01:22:37,102
Marcellus Gallio, tribune of Rome.

898
01:22:37,728 --> 01:22:39,812
Peter, fisherman of Galilee.

899
01:22:39,895 --> 01:22:42,732
A humble subject of the empire
is honoured, Tribune.

900
01:22:42,815 --> 01:22:45,317
I think the honour is mine, sir.

901
01:22:45,984 --> 01:22:48,820
Everybody, move closer.

902
01:22:49,903 --> 01:22:53,907
Sit down, children. Closer, everybody.

903
01:22:54,658 --> 01:22:58,036
Sit down. I want to talk to you.

904
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:05,334
Neighbours and friends, many of us
were privileged to know our master.

905
01:23:05,916 --> 01:23:10,504
But none was as close to him
as our friend Simon of Galilee,

906
01:23:11,129 --> 01:23:15,216
whom he loved as his own brother,
and whom he called Peter.

907
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:22,305
On that terrible night when he was betrayed,
when some doubted and all fled his side,

908
01:23:22,388 --> 01:23:27,309
only Peter remained steadfast,
loyal to the end.

909
01:23:27,392 --> 01:23:30,604
You may speak in a moment, Peter.
Now it's my turn.

910
01:23:30,687 --> 01:23:34,690
And so, my neighbours, on this happy day,

911
01:23:34,774 --> 01:23:37,692
I welcome you here to honour...

912
01:23:50,203 --> 01:23:52,705
Stop it. Stop it!

913
01:23:56,917 --> 01:23:59,335
Stop it. Stay where you are.

914
01:24:00,086 --> 01:24:02,380
Advance. Advance.

915
01:24:03,089 --> 01:24:05,173
Halt.

916
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:10,219
Well, Tribune. Your new command?

917
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:16,724
Centurion, by what authority
do you attack these people?

918
01:24:16,808 --> 01:24:19,434
I need no authority
to clean out a nest of traitors.

919
01:24:19,518 --> 01:24:23,063
- Withdraw your men.
- And your authority, Tribune?

920
01:24:24,356 --> 01:24:27,149
- An imperial commission.
- I know you have it.

921
01:24:27,233 --> 01:24:30,193
But it's no longer in effect.
Tiberius is dead.

922
01:24:31,111 --> 01:24:34,447
Caligula is emperor.
Hits you hard, doesn't it?

923
01:24:35,322 --> 01:24:37,408
- Men.
- Wait.

924
01:24:38,659 --> 01:24:44,289
An imperial commission is good until it is
revoked by the emperor, whoever he may be.

925
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:46,873
- Have you new orders from Caligula?
- No, but...

926
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:49,251
Then obey mine.

927
01:24:57,674 --> 01:24:59,968
Make me obey, Tribune.

928
01:25:01,303 --> 01:25:04,471
No. You won't try, will you?

929
01:25:04,638 --> 01:25:07,307
Brave enough with a dice, or a cup of wine.

930
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:11,769
A tribune because you bear an important
name, because you have friends at court.

931
01:25:11,853 --> 01:25:16,106
Well, you outrank me, but
I earned my rank, every step of it,

932
01:25:16,189 --> 01:25:20,568
in Gaul and Iberia and Africa,
against the enemies of Rome.

933
01:25:22,194 --> 01:25:24,487
With this.

934
01:25:26,281 --> 01:25:28,490
Make me obey you, Tribune,

935
01:25:28,782 --> 01:25:31,243
if you're fool enough to try.

936
01:25:36,956 --> 01:25:38,624
You are a fool.

937
01:25:38,707 --> 01:25:43,003
I've split more men from head to foot
than you see in this square.

938
01:25:43,086 --> 01:25:46,839
If I win, you'll keep your word?
You'll withdraw your men?

939
01:25:46,923 --> 01:25:49,758
If you win, they'll be yours to command.

940
01:25:50,342 --> 01:25:52,636
I'll be dead.

941
01:27:39,389 --> 01:27:42,433
Well? What are you waiting for?

942
01:27:43,475 --> 01:27:45,768
Finish it.

943
01:28:00,156 --> 01:28:03,116
You may give that order now, Centurion.

944
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:40,438
Column! Form square!

945
01:28:54,157 --> 01:28:56,243
Prepare to march.

946
01:28:56,326 --> 01:28:58,620
Formation, turn.

947
01:28:59,411 --> 01:29:01,664
Column forward.

948
01:30:07,758 --> 01:30:09,844
Marcellus?

949
01:30:19,894 --> 01:30:22,229
Demetrius and I will leave in the morning.

950
01:30:22,313 --> 01:30:27,317
We go to Syria, Lebanon, then Greece,
Sicily, and finally Rome itself.

951
01:30:28,234 --> 01:30:30,319
Everywhere we'll find friends.

952
01:30:30,402 --> 01:30:32,487
Everywhere our movement grows.

953
01:30:33,197 --> 01:30:35,448
And you, Marcellus?

954
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:37,950
I suppose I'll go back to Rome.

955
01:30:38,034 --> 01:30:41,328
Demetrius and I
wondered if you'd come with us.

956
01:30:41,411 --> 01:30:45,164
- You want me?
- We can always use courage and devotion.

957
01:30:46,457 --> 01:30:48,584
No. No.

958
01:30:49,501 --> 01:30:53,087
- It's impossible. I can never be one of you.
- Why not?

959
01:30:54,005 --> 01:30:57,466
Marcellus, is there
something you want to tell me?

960
01:30:59,426 --> 01:31:01,511
Yes.

961
01:31:03,012 --> 01:31:05,097
Yes.

962
01:31:08,558 --> 01:31:11,185
- I'll try.
- If it will make it easier,

963
01:31:11,268 --> 01:31:14,104
let me tell you about the burden I carry.

964
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:18,066
You heard Justus say
I was steadfast and loyal.

965
01:31:18,816 --> 01:31:21,110
He didn't know.

966
01:31:21,194 --> 01:31:24,071
The night Jesus needed
me most, I denied him.

967
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:30,618
Not once, but three times.
I swore I never knew him.

968
01:31:31,452 --> 01:31:33,620
Now.

969
01:31:35,705 --> 01:31:39,500
I crucified him.

970
01:31:41,001 --> 01:31:44,128
I know. Demetrius told me.

971
01:31:48,048 --> 01:31:50,300
And you can forgive me?

972
01:31:50,926 --> 01:31:53,219
He forgave you from the cross.

973
01:31:53,845 --> 01:31:56,097
Can I do less?

974
01:31:58,307 --> 01:32:01,226
Now, does anything stand in your way?

975
01:32:02,143 --> 01:32:04,436
Can you be one of us?

976
01:32:07,273 --> 01:32:09,440
From this day on,

977
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:12,026
I'm enlisted in his service.

978
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:16,113
I offer him my sword, my fortune and my life.

979
01:32:17,322 --> 01:32:20,241
And this I pledge you
on my honour as a Roman.

980
01:32:58,564 --> 01:33:01,275
- Will you wait for me here, please?
- Yes, my lady.

981
01:33:12,117 --> 01:33:14,535
The emperor will see you now.

982
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:45,769
The lady Diana, as beautiful as ever.

983
01:33:46,812 --> 01:33:50,481
- And as cold.
- You commanded my presence here, sire.

984
01:33:50,564 --> 01:33:55,318
- Only because my invitations were ignored.
- I sent word that I was ill.

985
01:33:55,401 --> 01:34:00,906
And you have chosen to be a guest of
Senator Gallio, who bears me no great love.

986
01:34:02,157 --> 01:34:05,618
Shouldn't I consider
such behaviour an affront?

987
01:34:06,744 --> 01:34:08,830
You are the emperor, sire.

988
01:34:08,913 --> 01:34:11,456
It is not in my power to affront you.

989
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:13,875
Good. Good.

990
01:34:15,335 --> 01:34:20,005
Tell me, what news have the Gallios had
of their precious son Marcellus?

991
01:34:21,589 --> 01:34:23,883
- None, sire.
- And you.

992
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:27,094
He must have written to you.

993
01:34:29,179 --> 01:34:31,514
Not for almost a year.

994
01:34:31,597 --> 01:34:35,143
His last letter was from
a village in Palestine called Cana.

995
01:34:35,226 --> 01:34:37,144
And nothing since then?

996
01:34:37,227 --> 01:34:41,939
Nothing from Antioch,
or Ephesus, or Corinth?

997
01:34:45,693 --> 01:34:48,278
You are telling the truth, aren't you?

998
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:53,615
Poor Diana. He's played
you false, like the rest of us.

999
01:34:53,699 --> 01:34:57,119
- What do you mean?
- I mean he's here in Rome,

1000
01:34:57,202 --> 01:34:59,287
and has been for some time.

1001
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:02,081
- That's impossible.
- He fooled me, too.

1002
01:35:02,165 --> 01:35:04,666
I thought he was only a wastrel and a clown.

1003
01:35:04,749 --> 01:35:07,836
He's become one of the most
dangerous men in the empire,

1004
01:35:07,919 --> 01:35:10,504
a traitor and a conspirator against the state.

1005
01:35:10,588 --> 01:35:13,590
- No. Not Marcellus.
- That's why he hasn't come to you,

1006
01:35:13,673 --> 01:35:16,134
or his family, or his friends.

1007
01:35:16,217 --> 01:35:20,846
You've heard of this new sect, these fanatics
who call themselves Christians?

1008
01:35:20,929 --> 01:35:24,140
- He's one of them, one of the ringleaders.
- It can't be true.

1009
01:35:24,223 --> 01:35:27,351
No? Then come. I'll show you.

1010
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:35,107
You'll learn for yourself what kind of man
it is you preferred to your emperor.

1011
01:35:37,401 --> 01:35:39,695
Where is he?

1012
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:52,038
Marcellus's personal slave, remember?

1013
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:55,708
The day he dared to bid against me.

1014
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,502
But now no longer a slave.

1015
01:35:58,585 --> 01:36:00,962
His partner in treason.

1016
01:36:01,754 --> 01:36:04,173
- Has he talked?
- No, sire.

1017
01:36:04,507 --> 01:36:08,051
- Ask him again.
- Where is Tribune Gallio?

1018
01:36:09,886 --> 01:36:11,970
Where's he hiding?

1019
01:36:12,054 --> 01:36:14,139
Give him the wheel.

1020
01:36:19,936 --> 01:36:22,187
Three of them came here from Corinth.

1021
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:26,650
The Greek slave, a Jewish
fisherman, our loyal tribune.

1022
01:36:26,733 --> 01:36:29,693
We've caught one. Soon we'll have the others.

1023
01:36:29,777 --> 01:36:31,737
Where is he?

1024
01:36:31,946 --> 01:36:34,239
Give it to him.

1025
01:36:35,698 --> 01:36:38,700
Enough for now. He's no good to us dead.

1026
01:36:39,118 --> 01:36:41,495
Let him think about it for a while.

1027
01:36:55,089 --> 01:36:57,383
My lady. What's wrong?

1028
01:36:59,384 --> 01:37:01,427
It's Marcellus.

1029
01:37:01,511 --> 01:37:03,638
They say he's alive.

1030
01:37:03,721 --> 01:37:06,014
He's here in Rome.

1031
01:37:06,932 --> 01:37:09,351
- Who told you that?
- The emperor.

1032
01:37:11,435 --> 01:37:14,355
They have his slave in there.
They're torturing him.

1033
01:37:14,439 --> 01:37:17,482
- Demetrius is here in the palace?
- I saw him.

1034
01:37:18,275 --> 01:37:20,568
You're sure?

1035
01:37:24,488 --> 01:37:26,573
What is it, Marcipor?

1036
01:37:26,656 --> 01:37:28,950
What do you know about it?

1037
01:37:32,369 --> 01:37:34,663
You've seen Marcellus.

1038
01:37:35,622 --> 01:37:38,624
You're one of them. A Christian.

1039
01:37:39,167 --> 01:37:41,251
Yes, my lady.

1040
01:37:42,669 --> 01:37:44,754
Take me to him.

1041
01:37:46,006 --> 01:37:48,632
- I can't.
- Do you think I'd betray him?

1042
01:37:48,716 --> 01:37:51,010
Take me to him.

1043
01:37:53,261 --> 01:37:55,138
Come.

1044
01:39:11,366 --> 01:39:13,660
Wait here.

1045
01:39:38,805 --> 01:39:42,850
- Where have they got Demetrius?
- In the armoury, below the guardroom.

1046
01:39:44,643 --> 01:39:46,937
I know the place.

1047
01:39:49,021 --> 01:39:51,649
- Where's Peter?
- At the meeting in Bovillae.

1048
01:39:51,732 --> 01:39:55,986
- He won't be back until midnight.
- Right. We can't wait for him.

1049
01:39:57,779 --> 01:40:01,407
Get me ten volunteers to come
with me as soon as it's dark.

1050
01:40:01,490 --> 01:40:03,242
I'll go, Marcipor.

1051
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:16,836
Why didn't you come?
Why have you kept away from me?

1052
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:20,130
I would have come, soon.

1053
01:40:20,213 --> 01:40:22,716
But Caligula's decreed against us.

1054
01:40:23,258 --> 01:40:25,968
- He said...
- I can imagine what he said.

1055
01:40:27,928 --> 01:40:30,597
Whatever you are, you're not a traitor.

1056
01:40:31,639 --> 01:40:34,058
- If you're still ill...
- No.

1057
01:40:34,142 --> 01:40:38,103
I'm well. Really well,
for the first time in my life.

1058
01:40:42,023 --> 01:40:44,192
You found the robe?

1059
01:40:44,275 --> 01:40:46,359
Yes.

1060
01:40:49,446 --> 01:40:51,739
Here it is.

1061
01:40:54,241 --> 01:40:56,327
Here.

1062
01:40:57,368 --> 01:40:59,871
Why, it's just ordinary homespun.

1063
01:41:00,705 --> 01:41:03,540
- Was it really bewitched?
- In a way.

1064
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:07,919
It changed my life.
In time, it will change the world.

1065
01:41:11,255 --> 01:41:13,548
I don't understand.

1066
01:41:16,968 --> 01:41:19,929
It's a long story. And a strange one.

1067
01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:23,264
- About the robe?
- Yes.

1068
01:41:23,681 --> 01:41:26,684
About the robe, and the one who wore it.

1069
01:41:39,778 --> 01:41:41,863
- It's nearly dark.
- Good.

1070
01:41:41,947 --> 01:41:44,657
Send Marcipor to me when he comes back.

1071
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:53,498
Why are you dressed like that?

1072
01:41:53,581 --> 01:41:55,874
No, Marcellus. They'll kill you.

1073
01:41:56,291 --> 01:41:59,836
- You must have faith.
- Faith in what? This new god of yours?

1074
01:41:59,919 --> 01:42:04,340
He couldn't save his own Son.
They crucified him and they'll kill you, too.

1075
01:42:04,424 --> 01:42:07,676
- I can't leave Demetrius to be tortured.
- But you'll leave me.

1076
01:42:07,759 --> 01:42:12,346
I love you. Does this dream of yours
mean more to you than our love?

1077
01:42:14,432 --> 01:42:19,227
Marcellus, what you've told me
is a beautiful story, but it isn't true.

1078
01:42:19,853 --> 01:42:24,189
Justice and charity. Men will
never accept such a philosophy.

1079
01:42:24,273 --> 01:42:28,735
The world isn't like that.
It never has been, and it never will be.

1080
01:42:30,403 --> 01:42:33,405
Why must you throw
your life away for a slave?

1081
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:37,158
I owe him a great deal more than my life.

1082
01:42:44,247 --> 01:42:48,042
If your god means that much to you,
I won't stand in your way.

1083
01:42:50,002 --> 01:42:52,795
I want to be your wife whatever you believe.

1084
01:42:53,171 --> 01:42:56,924
I'd marry you if I had to
share you with a thousand gods.

1085
01:43:01,553 --> 01:43:03,637
Ready.

1086
01:43:03,721 --> 01:43:06,015
Oh, my love.

1087
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:14,897
Take her home.

1088
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:18,817
Diana, I'll come to you as soon as I can.

1089
01:43:19,859 --> 01:43:22,153
Keep the robe for me.

1090
01:43:49,675 --> 01:43:52,761
- Sentry, come with me.
- What's the watchword, Tribune?

1091
01:43:52,844 --> 01:43:56,180
- Hurry, you fool.
- Guard!

1092
01:43:58,057 --> 01:44:00,351
Who's there?

1093
01:44:06,064 --> 01:44:08,232
Stop. You. Stop.

1094
01:44:34,002 --> 01:44:36,296
Get the boy up.

1095
01:45:04,777 --> 01:45:07,613
On the emperor's business. Open up.

1096
01:45:07,864 --> 01:45:09,740
What business, Tribune?

1097
01:45:09,823 --> 01:45:12,826
If you're in command, my message is for you.

1098
01:45:13,243 --> 01:45:16,912
You're not one of the Praetorian tribunes.
I know them all.

1099
01:45:16,996 --> 01:45:19,290
Now!

1100
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:22,709
The keys. The keys, quick.

1101
01:45:38,472 --> 01:45:39,639
Quickly now.

1102
01:46:40,897 --> 01:46:45,693
I can't believe you let them take
an imperial prisoner from the palace itself.

1103
01:46:46,485 --> 01:46:49,655
Tribune Quintus, where
were you when this happened?

1104
01:46:49,738 --> 01:46:53,282
- I could send you to the galleys.
- The Greek was nearly dead.

1105
01:46:53,366 --> 01:46:57,244
- By now he's a corpse.
- The Greek? Who cares about the Greek?

1106
01:46:57,327 --> 01:47:00,163
Or the Jew fisherman
or any of the rest of them?

1107
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:05,834
I want the Roman traitor who's responsible,
who made fools of the Praetorian Guard.

1108
01:47:05,917 --> 01:47:09,963
I want Tribune Gallio. I want him
in my hands before sunrise.

1109
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:14,091
I want him alive. I want him
to stand before me alive.

1110
01:47:14,174 --> 01:47:17,510
Do you hear me? Find him
or you'll all go to the galleys.

1111
01:47:17,593 --> 01:47:20,972
Tear the city apart if you have to.
But find him!

1112
01:47:21,389 --> 01:47:23,724
Now, get out, all of you.

1113
01:47:23,807 --> 01:47:25,892
Go.

1114
01:47:34,441 --> 01:47:36,526
- Anything?
- No, sir.

1115
01:47:38,235 --> 01:47:39,903
- And you?
- No, sir.

1116
01:47:39,987 --> 01:47:42,072
- Upstairs?
- No, sir.

1117
01:47:43,614 --> 01:47:45,908
Detail, form.

1118
01:47:52,205 --> 01:47:54,373
Senator.

1119
01:47:54,457 --> 01:47:56,751
Detail, march.

1120
01:49:22,028 --> 01:49:25,572
- I can barely feel the heartbeat.
- He can't die.

1121
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:30,451
- Is he such a valuable slave?
- He's one of the most valuable men alive.

1122
01:49:30,785 --> 01:49:34,162
- Well, he won't be alive for long.
- You're a physician.

1123
01:49:34,246 --> 01:49:36,832
There are limits to what science can achieve.

1124
01:49:36,915 --> 01:49:41,919
I can't put shattered flesh together again,
nor restore the blood he's lost.

1125
01:49:47,465 --> 01:49:51,635
Father in heaven, he was
the bravest and best of thy servants.

1126
01:49:53,304 --> 01:49:55,722
Why hast thou abandoned him?

1127
01:50:30,459 --> 01:50:33,085
Let me be alone with him.

1128
01:50:33,169 --> 01:50:35,796
You stay, Marcellus. And you, Diana.

1129
01:50:36,713 --> 01:50:39,674
Who is this man? Is he a physician?

1130
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:41,843
No. Please go.

1131
01:50:48,806 --> 01:50:51,309
For my sake, sir. Please.

1132
01:51:05,695 --> 01:51:07,781
Demetrius.

1133
01:51:10,324 --> 01:51:12,409
Demetrius.

1134
01:51:27,213 --> 01:51:31,800
- What's he doing in there? Who is he?
- I've never seen him before.

1135
01:51:31,883 --> 01:51:36,136
Senator Gallio should inform himself
about what goes on in his own household,

1136
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:38,764
with his own son.

1137
01:51:38,847 --> 01:51:42,392
This is my house, sir.
You were called here as a physician,

1138
01:51:42,475 --> 01:51:47,562
- not to question my family's behaviour.
- I'm a physician, but first of all a Roman.

1139
01:51:47,646 --> 01:51:50,065
And I must tell you bluntly that...

1140
01:52:36,519 --> 01:52:39,730
- He's gone?
- We didn't even thank him.

1141
01:52:41,398 --> 01:52:43,691
What did he do?

1142
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:47,236
You were here. You saw it.

1143
01:52:48,195 --> 01:52:50,739
- Yes, he...
- Can't you speak?

1144
01:52:50,822 --> 01:52:53,074
Are you bewitched?

1145
01:52:53,907 --> 01:52:56,285
So that's it. Sorcery.

1146
01:52:57,202 --> 01:53:02,206
Doesn't your friend know the penalty
for pretending to heal by such methods?

1147
01:53:03,374 --> 01:53:05,459
Pretending?

1148
01:53:12,298 --> 01:53:17,093
Marius, you did everything
in your power, and we're grateful.

1149
01:53:17,177 --> 01:53:19,846
- Come, stay and eat with us.
- No, thank you.

1150
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:22,264
There are mysteries to life and death, yes.

1151
01:53:22,348 --> 01:53:24,808
Patients have made astonishing recoveries.

1152
01:53:24,892 --> 01:53:29,312
But I have never ascribed them to the magic
of a sorcerer. Good night to you, Senator.

1153
01:53:29,395 --> 01:53:31,480
Tribune.

1154
01:53:38,778 --> 01:53:41,113
Do you think he'll go to Caligula?

1155
01:53:41,197 --> 01:53:44,741
I think he's a proud man
and his pride's been hurt.

1156
01:53:49,995 --> 01:53:54,374
Well, if your slave's fit to be moved,
you'd better take him back to the catacombs.

1157
01:53:54,457 --> 01:53:59,044
Marcipor? Order a carriage
and two men to help me with Demetrius.

1158
01:54:03,172 --> 01:54:04,882
Sir.

1159
01:54:06,092 --> 01:54:09,261
I'd like to see you again,
to tell you more about our...

1160
01:54:09,344 --> 01:54:12,264
We are seeing each other for the last time.

1161
01:54:13,305 --> 01:54:16,684
You have chosen to make
yourself an enemy of Rome.

1162
01:54:17,101 --> 01:54:19,602
From this night on, I have no son.

1163
01:54:30,236 --> 01:54:32,738
I've brought something for you.

1164
01:54:42,204 --> 01:54:45,039
Tomorrow I'll send for you.

1165
01:54:45,456 --> 01:54:47,542
- All ready, sir.
- Yes.

1166
01:54:52,087 --> 01:54:54,172
Tomorrow.

1167
01:55:45,339 --> 01:55:47,215
We're being followed.

1168
01:55:50,676 --> 01:55:52,970
Faster. Faster.

1169
01:56:43,052 --> 01:56:45,346
- Stop at the bridge.
- Yes, sir.

1170
01:56:57,897 --> 01:57:01,817
- No, don't.
- For all you've been to me, thanks.

1171
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:09,865
Into the carriage.

1172
01:57:09,949 --> 01:57:12,243
Get him to Peter.

1173
01:57:15,370 --> 01:57:18,080
Goodbye, friend.

1174
01:57:19,790 --> 01:57:22,084
Goodbye, friend.

1175
01:57:53,484 --> 01:57:56,195
I can only give you a few moments.

1176
01:57:56,987 --> 01:57:59,072
Diana.

1177
01:58:06,203 --> 01:58:08,538
I prayed that I'd see you again.

1178
01:58:09,164 --> 01:58:11,957
We haven't much time, Marcellus, so listen.

1179
01:58:12,041 --> 01:58:16,544
Tomorrow you're to be put on trial
before the entire court.

1180
01:58:16,628 --> 01:58:19,422
- I never thought I'd get a trial.
- Your father's powerful.

1181
01:58:19,505 --> 01:58:24,176
Caligula can't just kill you.
He's forced to prove that you're guilty.

1182
01:58:24,259 --> 01:58:26,677
He'll have no trouble proving it.

1183
01:58:29,263 --> 01:58:31,598
It's up to you, Marcellus.

1184
01:58:33,683 --> 01:58:36,019
What do you want me to do?

1185
01:58:36,436 --> 01:58:38,771
Don't defy Caligula.

1186
01:58:39,813 --> 01:58:42,524
Your god doesn't want you to die. He can't.

1187
01:58:42,899 --> 01:58:46,653
Otherwise he wouldn't have
sent Peter to save Demetrius.

1188
01:58:47,444 --> 01:58:49,530
I'm afraid, Diana.

1189
01:58:52,282 --> 01:58:55,326
In Cana I lived with people
who were not afraid.

1190
01:58:55,952 --> 01:59:00,288
People who'd met Jesus face to face,
who'd spoken with him,

1191
01:59:01,331 --> 01:59:03,749
eaten and laughed with him.

1192
01:59:04,792 --> 01:59:08,795
A crippled girl who thought
herself fortunate to be lame.

1193
01:59:08,878 --> 01:59:14,007
A weaver whose words were like his work:
simple, and lasting, and strong.

1194
01:59:15,926 --> 01:59:18,720
A little boy who gave his donkey to a friend.

1195
01:59:19,637 --> 01:59:23,975
Never again in his life would he own
anything as fine as that donkey,

1196
01:59:24,058 --> 01:59:28,311
and yet he gave it happily,
without a second thought.

1197
01:59:30,479 --> 01:59:35,984
If these people had denied him
one after the other, to save their skins,

1198
01:59:38,444 --> 01:59:40,904
would he have any followers left?

1199
01:59:43,866 --> 01:59:46,325
I want to think as you do.

1200
01:59:46,409 --> 01:59:50,037
I want to be like those people,
but I can't do it alone.

1201
01:59:50,871 --> 01:59:53,164
I can't do it without you.

1202
01:59:53,999 --> 01:59:57,585
My faith in what you told me
isn't strong enough.

1203
01:59:57,668 --> 02:00:01,129
If you die, I'll believe
that you died for nothing.

1204
02:00:01,754 --> 02:00:04,465
My lady, you'll have to go now.

1205
02:00:08,385 --> 02:00:10,679
Please, Marcellus.

1206
02:00:11,096 --> 02:00:13,598
I need you.

1207
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:37,290
Senator, the emperor wishes
to speak to you and the lady Diana.

1208
02:01:51,344 --> 02:01:53,720
Greetings to our loyal senator.

1209
02:01:53,804 --> 02:01:56,598
The proceedings here today will interest you.

1210
02:01:56,682 --> 02:02:00,017
- Sire, I am not in the mood for...
- Patience.

1211
02:02:00,101 --> 02:02:03,436
- If my son is to be put on trial...
- Patience!

1212
02:02:04,396 --> 02:02:06,898
You will sit by me.

1213
02:02:12,611 --> 02:02:15,738
Thank you, sire, but
my place is with the senator.

1214
02:02:15,822 --> 02:02:19,241
Your place is where your emperor decides.

1215
02:02:19,324 --> 02:02:21,743
Isn't that so, Senator?

1216
02:02:37,882 --> 02:02:41,926
- You don't look very happy.
- Have I reason to be?

1217
02:02:42,010 --> 02:02:45,762
There isn't a woman in Rome
who wouldn't pray for this honour.

1218
02:02:45,846 --> 02:02:49,183
There's only one man
at whose side I pray to sit.

1219
02:02:50,808 --> 02:02:55,896
Before this day is out, you will
be praying on your knees to me.

1220
02:02:55,979 --> 02:02:58,273
For his life.

1221
02:03:02,776 --> 02:03:05,488
Senators, Romans...

1222
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:11,325
As you know, there exists today
in our empire, and even in Rome itself,

1223
02:03:11,742 --> 02:03:18,122
a secret party of seditionists
who call themselves Christians.

1224
02:03:19,957 --> 02:03:26,505
They have enlisted in their ranks the riffraff
of the plebeian class, as well as slaves.

1225
02:03:27,505 --> 02:03:31,133
We have known slave uprisings in the past.

1226
02:03:31,217 --> 02:03:33,635
We remember Spartacus.

1227
02:03:34,052 --> 02:03:37,679
But now it grieves us to inform you

1228
02:03:38,514 --> 02:03:42,184
that one of our own tribunes
has betrayed his trust

1229
02:03:42,267 --> 02:03:46,312
and joined this party of conspirators.

1230
02:03:47,814 --> 02:03:52,359
You, not we, shall be
the judges of his treason.

1231
02:03:52,943 --> 02:03:55,528
Bring in Tribune Marcellus Gallio.

1232
02:04:51,656 --> 02:04:56,035
Tribune Gallio, you have been informed
of the charges against you?

1233
02:04:56,119 --> 02:04:57,161
I have, sire.

1234
02:04:57,244 --> 02:05:00,456
You stand before
the senators and nobles of Rome.

1235
02:05:00,539 --> 02:05:03,040
They wait to hear your defence.

1236
02:05:07,544 --> 02:05:09,838
It is true that I am a Christian.

1237
02:05:13,090 --> 02:05:17,261
It is not true that those of us
who follow the teachings of Jesus

1238
02:05:17,344 --> 02:05:20,138
are engaged in any plot against the state.

1239
02:05:20,221 --> 02:05:26,185
But isn't it a fact that
you call this Jesus a king?

1240
02:05:26,768 --> 02:05:28,853
Yes, sire.

1241
02:05:29,395 --> 02:05:32,023
But his kingdom is not of this world.

1242
02:05:33,274 --> 02:05:35,400
He seeks no earthly throne.

1243
02:05:35,942 --> 02:05:40,362
He reigns over the hearts and minds of men
in the name ofjustice and charity.

1244
02:05:40,446 --> 02:05:43,657
And are these virtues
not to be found in our empire?

1245
02:05:44,115 --> 02:05:47,702
Was it justice, or was it charity
that gave me my orders

1246
02:05:47,786 --> 02:05:50,621
when I put him to death on the cross?

1247
02:05:51,413 --> 02:05:53,999
You put him to death?

1248
02:05:54,082 --> 02:05:57,251
Then why are you risking your life for him?

1249
02:05:57,877 --> 02:06:00,337
I owe him more than my life.

1250
02:06:01,671 --> 02:06:05,132
- He forgave me my crime against him.
- Crime?

1251
02:06:05,549 --> 02:06:10,137
Do you maintain that it's a crime
for a Roman soldier to obey his orders?

1252
02:06:10,221 --> 02:06:12,680
The empire is governed by men.

1253
02:06:13,306 --> 02:06:18,769
Men sometimes make mistakes. And this
was the greatest mistake ever made by Rome.

1254
02:06:18,852 --> 02:06:21,395
So, the empire makes mistakes.

1255
02:06:22,230 --> 02:06:25,733
And perhaps the emperor
himself makes mistakes?

1256
02:06:26,150 --> 02:06:28,235
Sire,

1257
02:06:28,318 --> 02:06:32,404
it is I who am on trial here, not you.

1258
02:06:37,117 --> 02:06:39,577
What's that thing you're holding?

1259
02:06:39,661 --> 02:06:42,579
His robe. He wore it to the cross.

1260
02:06:42,663 --> 02:06:44,957
Let me see it.

1261
02:06:46,917 --> 02:06:49,877
No. I remember. It's bewitched.

1262
02:06:49,961 --> 02:06:52,671
- No, sire.
- You. Take it.

1263
02:06:53,046 --> 02:06:55,549
- Destroy it.
- Sire, may I keep it?

1264
02:07:03,221 --> 02:07:05,515
Sorcery too.

1265
02:07:05,598 --> 02:07:08,309
Did you think it would protect you here?

1266
02:07:09,143 --> 02:07:11,353
- No, sire.
- Tell me, Tribune.

1267
02:07:11,437 --> 02:07:16,190
Do you expect us to believe stories that
Jesus could heal by the touch of his hand,

1268
02:07:16,274 --> 02:07:19,359
make the crippled walk
and the blind see again?

1269
02:07:20,735 --> 02:07:24,530
It makes no difference whether
you believe them or not, sire.

1270
02:07:24,613 --> 02:07:29,534
All that matters is that there's no story
that he ever made anyone blind,

1271
02:07:29,617 --> 02:07:32,162
no story that he made anyone a cripple,

1272
02:07:32,245 --> 02:07:34,997
or ever raised his hand except to heal.

1273
02:07:35,622 --> 02:07:38,208
Sire, if you'd had the chance I had,

1274
02:07:38,834 --> 02:07:42,587
to talk with those who knew him,
to learn what was in his heart...

1275
02:07:42,670 --> 02:07:46,131
Stop. Are you trying
to convert me to your treason?

1276
02:07:46,548 --> 02:07:49,092
I only want to show you
your opportunity, sire.

1277
02:07:49,176 --> 02:07:53,012
If the empire desires peace
and brotherhood among all men,

1278
02:07:53,095 --> 02:07:56,514
then my king will be on the side
of Rome and her emperor.

1279
02:07:57,265 --> 02:08:01,894
But if the empire and the emperor pursue
the course of aggression and slavery

1280
02:08:01,977 --> 02:08:04,938
that have brought agony
and despair to the world,

1281
02:08:05,022 --> 02:08:07,815
if there's nothing left but chains and hunger,

1282
02:08:07,899 --> 02:08:10,526
then my king will march
to right those wrongs.

1283
02:08:10,610 --> 02:08:15,447
Not tomorrow, sire. Your Majesty may not
witness the establishment of his kingdom.

1284
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:18,240
But it will come.

1285
02:08:21,911 --> 02:08:26,081
You have heard him. He stands
convicted out of his own mouth.

1286
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,374
What is your pleasure?

1287
02:08:34,087 --> 02:08:36,047
Death.

1288
02:08:36,255 --> 02:08:37,882
Death.

1289
02:08:46,305 --> 02:08:48,474
You see? It is the will of the people.

1290
02:08:48,557 --> 02:08:52,560
The will of your slaves and parasites.
How dare you speak ofjustice?

1291
02:08:52,644 --> 02:08:56,188
He's not a traitor. You haven't
proved that and you never will.

1292
02:08:56,271 --> 02:08:59,066
Then listen. You will see that I am just.

1293
02:08:59,482 --> 02:09:03,403
Listen. Tribune Gallio,
you stand condemned to death.

1294
02:09:03,486 --> 02:09:05,654
But it is our desire to be merciful.

1295
02:09:05,737 --> 02:09:08,615
We give you a chance
to recant your treason and go free.

1296
02:09:08,698 --> 02:09:12,118
Kneel to us and renew your oath
of loyalty to your emperor.

1297
02:09:12,201 --> 02:09:17,122
Renounce your allegiance to this dead Jew
who dared to call himself a king.

1298
02:09:39,682 --> 02:09:41,766
Sire...

1299
02:09:43,309 --> 02:09:48,313
With all my heart I renew my pledge
of loyalty to my emperor and to Rome,

1300
02:09:49,815 --> 02:09:52,066
a pledge which I have never broken.

1301
02:09:52,150 --> 02:09:54,610
And the other? Jesus?

1302
02:09:54,694 --> 02:09:57,404
Renounce him, so all can hear.

1303
02:10:04,452 --> 02:10:07,371
I cannot renounce him, sire. Nor can you.

1304
02:10:07,996 --> 02:10:10,290
He is my king and yours as well.

1305
02:10:11,124 --> 02:10:13,417
He is the Son of God.

1306
02:10:14,793 --> 02:10:17,796
- And that is your answer?
- Yes, sire.

1307
02:10:21,299 --> 02:10:26,011
Tribune Gallio, we decree that you be taken
immediately to the palace archery field

1308
02:10:26,094 --> 02:10:28,680
and put to death for high treason.

1309
02:10:34,267 --> 02:10:37,103
No, Diana. There's no reason for it.

1310
02:10:37,187 --> 02:10:39,730
Sire, Marcellus is my chosen husband.

1311
02:10:39,813 --> 02:10:42,274
- I ask to go with him.
- Stand back.

1312
02:10:42,357 --> 02:10:45,359
You're not on trial.
There's no evidence against you.

1313
02:10:45,443 --> 02:10:49,030
Then if it please you, sire,
I'll provide evidence.

1314
02:10:49,113 --> 02:10:53,283
I have no wish to live another hour
in an empire ruled by you.

1315
02:10:54,659 --> 02:10:56,911
You dare to call yourself a Caesar.

1316
02:10:57,578 --> 02:11:02,791
Once the Caesars of Rome were noble, but
in you noble blood has turned to poison.

1317
02:11:02,874 --> 02:11:04,959
You corrupt Rome with spite and malice.

1318
02:11:05,043 --> 02:11:07,378
- Stop. Stop it!
- That you should be Caesar!

1319
02:11:07,753 --> 02:11:10,881
Vicious, treacherous, drunk with power.

1320
02:11:11,297 --> 02:11:14,258
An evil, insane monster posing as emperor.

1321
02:11:14,425 --> 02:11:15,718
Stop it!

1322
02:11:15,802 --> 02:11:18,470
As for me, I have found another king.

1323
02:11:19,721 --> 02:11:23,349
I want to go with my husband
into his kingdom.

1324
02:11:24,725 --> 02:11:27,143
Then by the gods you shall.

1325
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:31,523
Go. Both of you. Into your kingdom!

1326
02:12:11,638 --> 02:12:13,932
They're going into a better kingdom.

1327
02:12:14,141 --> 02:12:16,892
They're going into a better kingdom.

1328
02:12:17,101 --> 02:12:19,270
They're going to meet their king.

1329
02:12:19,478 --> 02:12:21,646
They're going to meet their king.

1330
02:12:26,316 --> 02:12:28,610
For the big fisherman.

1331
