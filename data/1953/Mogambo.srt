1
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,093
Laddie, our luck's in.

2
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,639
Black leopard, laddie.

3
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,758
Black leopard nosing the kill.

4
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,265
Get the jeep, Brownie.

5
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:30,726
Boltchak!

6
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:46,111
Come on, on your feet. Let's go.

7
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:02,477
Don't let him twist that net.

8
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:15,821
Come on, get around there.
Get a move on, man.

9
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:17,451
Easy, Boltchak!

10
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:21,948
- Big time! He's a big one!
- Yeah. Young too.

11
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,461
Boltchak, stop that!

12
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:00,911
Who's there? Bunny?

13
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,747
Bunny?

14
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,747
No, this is not Bunny.

15
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:11,254
Who are you?

16
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:14,596
May I ask who you are, why you're here...

17
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:19,759
- ...and what in blue blazes is going on?
- My name is Eloise Kelly.

18
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:24,219
Better known in the gay capitals of Europe
as "Honey Bear" Kelly.

19
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:27,434
The first thing that's going on is my robe,
on your arm there...

20
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:29,731
...if you'll be so cooperative.

21
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:32,812
With pleasure, Miss Kelly.

22
00:06:33,822 --> 00:06:35,862
Stop. Throw.

23
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:40,529
Turn around.

24
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:45,035
No kidding, find Bunny
and tell him I'm here, will you?

25
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:49,157
I'd be glad to, if you'd tell me
who Bunny is and where I'd find him.

26
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:53,495
The Maharajah of Bunganore.
Didn't he tell you I was coming?

27
00:06:57,343 --> 00:07:00,213
So you came down to visit
with the Maharajah?

28
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:02,380
Sure. All the way from New York.

29
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,806
I think it's a dirty trick he wasn't on hand
to meet me when I came.

30
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:09,641
- Didn't he tell you?
- No. The Maharajah is in India.

31
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:11,640
He left here a week ago.

32
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:13,890
- He didn't.
- Yes, he did.

33
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,983
It seems someone is trying to take away
some of his palaces.

34
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:19,478
So he went back
to see what he could do about it.

35
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:22,489
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

36
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,742
Didn't he say anything about me,
that I was coming or anything?

37
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,370
No, he didn't.

38
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:31,829
Just between you and me,
I think he's turned out to be a big heel.

39
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:34,572
He didn't even leave you a return ticket.

40
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:38,700
Look, Mr. Whoever-You-Are,
let me jump to my own conclusions.

41
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,880
Of all the rotten, subversive tricks.

42
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:46,125
Flying all the way, thousands of miles,
to this lousy place...

43
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:49,007
...arriving here hot and tired
as a Sixth Avenue mink....

44
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,012
That water's even hotter, and that soap
gives out as much lather as blue cheese.

45
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:56,184
I'm the man that owns this building,
the shower, and the soap.

46
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:59,556
- I wouldn't be proud of it.
- This is my home, be it ever so humble.

47
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:01,392
I had to have some place to go.

48
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:04,187
I couldn't get a word out of laughing boy
over there...

49
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,152
...with the sleigh bells in his ears.

50
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:10,949
Of all the dirty-

51
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:14,532
Bawling out the Maharajah long-distance
isn't going to do any good.

52
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,281
If you'll pardon my subtlety...

53
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,242
I'm not so sure I'd want you on safari
in the first place.

54
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,538
I run a business here.
I'm working these men.

55
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,618
They have to keep their mind on work-

56
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,795
Look, buster,
don't you get overstimulated with me.

57
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,669
I'm the little gal that flew all the way
from New York...

58
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,628
...to this lousy place, this Dark Continent.

59
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:35,133
Only I expected to find
a man with a flashlight.

60
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:38,673
I suggest you use up some of that energy
in getting your clothes on.

61
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,720
- I'll assign you to a room at the other end.
- Wait a minute.

62
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:45,429
Can't you get me a canoe, or a truck,
or roller skates to get out of here?

63
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:48,855
Trucks couldn't get through this country,
even if I could spare one.

64
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,231
You're stuck with us
until next week's boat.

65
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:54,072
- You mean there's no way to get out?
- No.

66
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:57,904
Now, weren't you going to do something
about getting dressed?

67
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:01,198
Boy.

68
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:04,412
This will be the gayest week
of the season.

69
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:13,871
Plenty deep, all right.

70
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:17,456
I thought I told you to replace
that barbed wire.

71
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:21,299
We went after a black leopard,
remember, laddie?

72
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,471
I'm sorry, Brownie.

73
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:39,105
Hi, girl. Hello. How are you? Come here.

74
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,440
All right, let's get on with the feeding.

75
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:50,866
What do you think I'm doing now?

76
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,624
Vic, you're getting too unstrung
for your own good.

77
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,625
Why don't you fly out to Nairobi
or even Cairo for a week or two?

78
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:03,466
You haven't been out of here
for just on a year.

79
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:08,751
I'd like to, but Dorgenbeck's yelling
for those two white hippo.

80
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:12,464
And I'll pick that cat up, if I have
to run him all the way to the Congo.

81
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:14,965
I know. But you need relaxation.

82
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:20,683
And the little trinket that's dropped
from the Maharajah's turban...

83
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:22,813
...she's a spry little bit.

84
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:27,686
That's playgirl stuff.
I've seen them in London, Paris, Rome.

85
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:29,902
They start life in a New York nightclub...

86
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:32,991
...and end up covering the world
like a paint advertisement.

87
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,732
Not an honest feeling
from her kneecap to her neck.

88
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:38,533
Getting rather meticulous, aren't you?

89
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:42,453
Maybe. Maybe it's about time.

90
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:05,014
Everything snarls around this joint.

91
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:10,681
Hi. How are you, boy? You're a nice guy.

92
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:17,311
Hi, fellas. Hi, boy.

93
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,706
Hi, boy.
Hey, you wanna chew some gum?

94
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:34,546
Hey, Kelly, get away from that chimp.

95
00:11:34,713 --> 00:11:37,039
And stop feeding him bubblegum.

96
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:41,921
- Can't anybody be friendly around here?
- Friendly? That chimp?

97
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:44,301
He'd bite your finger off just for fun.

98
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,714
- But he was only-
- It's your lookout.

99
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:50,010
His teeth are poison.
Once they sink into you, you'll blow up...

100
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:53,103
- ...like an eggplant.
- All the other animals are being fed.

101
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:54,814
May I ask what time we get ours?

102
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:58,396
You may not hear it with the other noises,
but I'm beginning to rumble.

103
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,145
We dine at 9.

104
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:04,239
How continental.

105
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,319
Come here, darling.

106
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:12,205
You're such a nice little baby.
Come on over.

107
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:17,958
Come on, little baby. You're nice.

108
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:26,546
This is Miss Kelly.
Mr. Brown-Pryce, Mr. Boltchak.

109
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:28,841
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

110
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:32,883
Mr. Marswell, you look a lot better.

111
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:35,680
I bet you even smell better.

112
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:38,384
Let's hope your temper's the equivalent.

113
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,855
It's on an even keel.
It'll probably improve with food.

114
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:45,941
Now that's my nice, healthy boy.

115
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:51,192
The Nordleys are coming out
by next week's boat...

116
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:53,108
...instead of the following.

117
00:12:53,283 --> 00:12:56,651
Good. That means we can get rid of them
one week earlier.

118
00:12:56,827 --> 00:13:00,243
- I'm handing them over to you, Boltchak.
- Relatives, I take it?

119
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:03,119
No, customers. He's an anthropologist.

120
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,245
He's going on safari.

121
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:09,998
You'll have to excuse me,
I left my cap and gown at the cleaners.

122
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:13,295
Anthropologist.

123
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:17,299
He studies man and man's development,
looks for skulls...

124
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:19,131
...examines heads and all that.

125
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:22,306
Examines heads. Should have met him
before I left New York.

126
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:24,302
He could have examined both mine.

127
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:31,515
Let's not get sick over this, gentlemen.
It's not that funny.

128
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,767
You're so good, Miss Kelly.

129
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:39,271
That ends that, doesn't it? No kidding,
I've never met scientific types.

130
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:41,654
I'd like to meet them.
I might learn something.

131
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:44,151
I don't think you'll be seeing
too much of them.

132
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:47,364
You'll be wanting to get back
on the same boat.

133
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:51,244
Okay, coach, take me out. I'm through.

134
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,587
Wait! Hey, wait a minute!

135
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,307
Hey, wait for me! Wait!

136
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:53,629
Hey, a kangaroo.

137
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:09,984
I'm sorry, I can't sleep with that lion
or whatever it is chirping.

138
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,905
- Do you mind if I stay here for a while?
- No, have a seat.

139
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:15,694
- Sure I won't bother you?
- No, not at all.

140
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:18,784
- New batch of magazines came in today.
- Good.

141
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,414
What makes him do that? Is he hungry?

142
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,923
There's probably a lioness lurking
in the bush out there somewhere.

143
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:38,129
I guess there's all sorts of hunger
in the world, isn't there?

144
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:44,756
This is a weird sort of business to be in,
collecting animals.

145
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:46,726
I guess it's fun for a man, isn't it?

146
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:51,096
When it's profitable.

147
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:53,356
You sell them to zoos?

148
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:55,519
Circuses, trainers.

149
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:58,317
How much do you get...

150
00:15:58,863 --> 00:16:00,655
...for a baby elephant, for instance?

151
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,444
A dumbo?

152
00:16:02,617 --> 00:16:04,989
Is that really the name for them?

153
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:10,155
- Around $5000. Tough to ship, though.
- I saw a baby elephant in the zoo once.

154
00:16:10,332 --> 00:16:13,286
He was sucking on a gallon jug of milk
with a nipple attached.

155
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,582
Can you imagine that?
A whole gallon of milk.

156
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:18,830
Their mothers carry much more than that.

157
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,003
More than a gallon?

158
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:29,974
I know. Have you got any kangaroos?
What do you get for a kangaroo?

159
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:32,596
You have to go to Australia for kangaroos.

160
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:37,059
Yes. Like I said,
I was educated at the York Club.

161
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:40,895
I'd like to see a kangaroo close up.
A mama kangaroo.

162
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:45,480
Is it true that they carry their babies
in a little pouch thing?

163
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:49,734
- That's right. All marsupials do that.
- Ma- What?

164
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,408
Animals that carry their young,
like a papoose in reverse.

165
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,496
Isn't that the darnedest thing.
Everything but a zipper, huh?

166
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:03,539
- Kelly, you're all right. How about a drink?
- I'd love one.

167
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:06,164
- Sorry about no ice.
- It's all right.

168
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:09,044
Doctors say it's bad
for your pouch, anyway.

169
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:12,752
- Soda or water?
- Water. I find always that with water....

170
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:23,593
- What's the matter?
- Do something!

171
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,644
- That's just old Joe.
- Old Joe?

172
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:29,141
Yes. He's our migratory mousetrap.

173
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,900
I bet there isn't a rat or a mouse
within 100 yards of this place.

174
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:38,029
Oh, boy, to think I haven't had
my first drink yet.

175
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:45,284
I have old Joe around to trap young girls
into where you are right now.

176
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:50,367
Oh, now, Mr. Marswell...

177
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:54,247
...I don't imagine you
need old Joe for that.

178
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:22,402
The river looks awfully pretty
in the moonlight, doesn't it?

179
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,210
Wait a minute.

180
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:40,836
You're turning
into the original African hotrod.

181
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:43,542
I can always quit.

182
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:48,592
You can be nice and sweet
when you want to, can't you?

183
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:52,844
How do you know?
Maybe you spoke too soon.

184
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,476
I'm warning you. I'm searching.
I'm looking, really I am.

185
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:04,477
I'll look with you for a little while.

186
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:32,003
Still pounding away at that old rogue?

187
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,878
Hi. It's the only piece of jazz
I've been able to find around this place.

188
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:39,140
It's been played more in the last week
than the last 30 years.

189
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:41,431
No kidding.
Have you been out here that long?

190
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:43,760
I came out here for my health.

191
00:19:44,771 --> 00:19:49,231
- I found it. I'm still here.
- Where did you get that scar?

192
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,309
An old buffalo charged.

193
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:54,896
First barrel misfired,
and we danced around a bit.

194
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:58,898
- That's one way to die, isn't it? Dancing.
- I don't know.

195
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:02,402
- Where did you get yours?
- What?

196
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:04,246
Your scars.

197
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,411
You've got them,
though they're not visible.

198
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:14,751
Sorry. I'm a nosy old idiot, my dear.

199
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:18,505
You're pretty smart.
Nice, gentle smart, though.

200
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,590
Someday when I know you better
I'll tell you all about it.

201
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,673
Listen to old Trader Horn out there.
"Attaboy. Chop, chop, bwana master. "

202
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,852
- All packed, Kelly?
- My, we're busy as.... Packed?

203
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:35,472
The boat's here in 10 minutes.
Muntala'll take your luggage to the dock.

204
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,105
Animals ready for loading, Brownie?

205
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:41,903
Yes.

206
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:31,317
Hi, sweetie.

207
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,037
Hello, baby.

208
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,996
Come and say goodbye to your mommy.

209
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:43,117
Your mommy's going home.

210
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:47,669
Now, you be a good little boy.

211
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,167
Wash behind your ears every day,
and eat all your nice raw potatoes...

212
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:55,260
...so you'll grow up to be
a big, fat elephant.

213
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:59,722
And then step on your
Uncle Victor's corns every day.

214
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,970
Oh, oh, the boat. Yeah.

215
00:22:20,242 --> 00:22:24,868
- I'll see your baggage aboard, my dear.
- Thank you. You've been very sweet.

216
00:22:25,663 --> 00:22:29,198
- You're a nice girl.
- I get it, Brownie.

217
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,701
He's running a business
and I'm a bottleneck.

218
00:22:31,878 --> 00:22:37,547
Sometimes a man can't see the one tree
because of the forest.

219
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:40,289
Someday he's gonna bump
into the wrong kind of tree...

220
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:42,425
...and get his nose busted.

221
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:45,512
Take care of yourself, Brownie.
And him too.

222
00:22:54,397 --> 00:22:55,512
Here we are.

223
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:13,369
I wish you could stick around for a while,
but I'll be too busy-

224
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,330
Don't spell it out for me.

225
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:19,746
You know, my little white hunter,
it's high time I was on my way anyhow.

226
00:23:21,964 --> 00:23:23,706
It's been....

227
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:28,172
- It's been nice having you here....
- Yes.

228
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:31,925
It's certainly been something
I didn't expect.

229
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,307
When the rainy season starts,
I might fly up to Paris.

230
00:23:36,476 --> 00:23:39,762
If you happen to be there,
we might run into each other again.

231
00:23:39,938 --> 00:23:41,100
Might.

232
00:23:46,443 --> 00:23:49,646
Take it easy. Drop me a line.

233
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:53,694
- Hello, Vic. Hello, Brownie.
- Hello, John.

234
00:23:54,117 --> 00:23:56,952
I have the happiness
to present Mr. Nordley.

235
00:23:58,704 --> 00:23:59,866
- Mr. Marswell?
- Yes.

236
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,698
How do you do? We finally made it.

237
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,747
- Mr. Nordley, Brown-Pryce.
- How are you?

238
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:05,791
And Mrs. Nordley.

239
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:08,086
Linda, darling.

240
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,423
- Mrs. Nordley.
- Mrs. Nordley.

241
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:14,300
- How do you do?
- Mr. Brown-Pryce.

242
00:24:14,468 --> 00:24:15,878
- Welcome.
- How do you do?

243
00:24:16,052 --> 00:24:18,460
It's so exciting and thrilling
finally to arrive-

244
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:20,964
Take them up to the house, will you?

245
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:24,349
This way, please.

246
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:47,826
Hey, kid.

247
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:53,456
- Have you got money for your plane fare?
- Yeah.

248
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:59,203
- Wait a minute-
- I'll brain you if you don't take it.

249
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:01,541
Let's call it a 99-year loan.

250
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:05,718
This is one loan I'll pay back
if I have to live 99 years to do it.

251
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:53,009
Well, here we go. Bronx Zoo next.

252
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:15,612
- Everything all right? Good trip?
- This is charming.

253
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,575
Everything's so neat and clean.

254
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,159
I'll be unbearably frank
and say I didn't expect this.

255
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:24,574
I'll be frank and say
that you're a big surprise to me too.

256
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,078
In what way?

257
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,494
The wife of the last scientist
who was here...

258
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,043
...weighed 180 pounds
of pure muscle...

259
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,041
...had a good start on a mustache...

260
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:36,375
...and every time she spoke
to her husband...

261
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:38,758
...every lion in the territory took off.

262
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:43,265
He was a little man with a beard,
an authority on some kind of flea.

263
00:26:43,474 --> 00:26:45,763
I sincerely hope I've disappointed you.

264
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:48,102
Come on, I'll show you your room.

265
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,103
This is Juma. He's your personal maid.
Anything you want, ask him.

266
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,854
You won't understand him,
but he will you.

267
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:08,533
- Isn't this nice?
- About the bed, I didn't know...

268
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:11,077
- ...so if you want twin beds-
- No.

269
00:27:11,374 --> 00:27:14,292
- All right.
- Everything's most satisfactory.

270
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:19,497
- I have the beastliest ringing in my ears.
- Feeling down, darling?

271
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:21,168
It must be those shots we took.

272
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:23,334
The doctor said
they cause a reaction.

273
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:25,798
- What shots?
- Yesterday, at the settlement...

274
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,470
- ...the tsetse fly injections.
- Tsetse fly?

275
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:33,057
Your letter didn't say anything
about going to tsetse fly country.

276
00:27:33,227 --> 00:27:36,311
We understood we had to go through
to get to the gorillas.

277
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,805
Not necessarily. And why gorillas?

278
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,187
It's a pet theory of mine.

279
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,525
I want to study gorillas,
their family life and so on.

280
00:27:44,695 --> 00:27:48,396
Even get some of their vocal sounds
on a tape recorder I brought with me.

281
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:51,823
- It's a theory on the derivative evolution-
- I wouldn't understand.

282
00:27:51,993 --> 00:27:55,861
Again, to be frank, it's a difficult safari,
and it doesn't fit with my schedule.

283
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,707
If I'd known about this,
I wouldn't have taken the job.

284
00:27:58,874 --> 00:27:59,905
Why?

285
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:02,622
You can't promise anything with gorillas
but trouble.

286
00:28:02,795 --> 00:28:05,831
Some have worked for ten months
and never even glimpsed one.

287
00:28:06,006 --> 00:28:07,548
I have other work to attend to.

288
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:10,004
- Donald's perfectly willing to pay-
- I'm sorry.

289
00:28:10,176 --> 00:28:12,714
We'll have to stand by
the original agreement.

290
00:28:12,887 --> 00:28:16,836
I'll hand you over to one of my assistants,
Mr. Boltchak. Perfectly capable-

291
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:19,008
- I want to work with you.
- Mr. Marswell...

292
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:21,343
...Mr. Nordley made
his arrangements with you.

293
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,769
He made them with my company,
my organization.

294
00:28:26,482 --> 00:28:28,142
Are you all right?

295
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:31,190
I think perhaps a glass of water....

296
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:41,073
- Donald, darling.
- Don't get excited.

297
00:28:41,246 --> 00:28:42,905
What's the matter with him?

298
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,531
Excessive reaction to the tsetse fly shot,
that's all.

299
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:49,159
He'll be out of his head for a day or two.

300
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,542
We'll snap him out of it.
I've got tablets.

301
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:54,714
Don't let him throw this blanket off.
The shoes.

302
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:07,884
Our young scientist just went
to his knees. Out cold. Tsetse fly shot.

303
00:29:08,186 --> 00:29:09,561
That's too bad.

304
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:13,596
Mr. Marswell, he's trembling
and shaking and getting nauseated.

305
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:15,684
We've got to get him to a doctor.

306
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,852
Moving him would aggravate
his condition.

307
00:29:18,028 --> 00:29:20,400
He's running a high fever.
We have to break it up.

308
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:24,190
- Haven't you a thermometer?
- We don't need one. Fever is fever.

309
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:25,564
But....

310
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,911
Just a minute, please, will you?

311
00:29:38,755 --> 00:29:40,214
Would one of these be...?

312
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,632
A lion chewed him up.

313
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:46,297
This place is turning into a hospital.

314
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:59,143
Strap him up, Brownie.

315
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,269
Would one of these be the right thing?
Donald knows all about them-

316
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:09,109
Sorry. Out here, we have three antidotes
for everything:

317
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:16,112
Quinine, iodine, and castor oil.
Quinine should fix him up very nicely.

318
00:30:16,454 --> 00:30:18,661
I don't think he needs
the other two, do you?

319
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:21,868
At certain times,
jokes are in very poor taste.

320
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:25,874
Come on, no reason to lose your temper.

321
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:38,759
Please hurry.

322
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:49,689
There you are.
He'll start to sweat in half an hour or so.

323
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,441
Keep him well covered up.
I'll be back from time to time.

324
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:57,988
He's strong enough, all right.
Got a bite like a young croc.

325
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:02,910
Mr. Marswell, just a minute.

326
00:31:04,122 --> 00:31:06,827
Is that all you're going to do for him?

327
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:11,081
What do you expect me to do?
Crawl in bed with him and hold his hand?

328
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:23,044
Keep him well covered up
and get all the water down him you can.

329
00:31:24,432 --> 00:31:28,594
- Will you do that? Will you do what I said?
- Yes.

330
00:31:35,024 --> 00:31:38,144
And give him one of those pills
every four hours.

331
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:40,987
Good night.

332
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:50,237
Mr. Marswell.
Oh, no, please sit still.

333
00:31:50,871 --> 00:31:53,327
It's time for his pill
but he's sleeping so well...

334
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:55,538
...I didn't want to wake him.

335
00:31:56,043 --> 00:31:57,667
I'll have a look.

336
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:07,301
Boltchak, play cards.

337
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:17,226
- Much better. Let him sleep.
- All right.

338
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,146
Good night.

339
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,688
I'd like to apologize about this morning.

340
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,571
I'm terribly ashamed.

341
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:36,201
I had it coming.

342
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:40,200
- You pack a good wallop.
- Please.

343
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:42,996
It was very shabby behavior.

344
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:53,292
- I hope you'll be comfortable on that.
- Yes, thank you.

345
00:32:53,468 --> 00:32:55,675
It was most thoughtful of you.

346
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:04,183
What on earth are those horrible sounds?
An animal of some kind?

347
00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:10,016
Yes. They're hippos fighting.

348
00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:36,540
- Why are they fighting?
- Probably over a female.

349
00:33:41,303 --> 00:33:46,640
- Thank you very much for everything.
- I'll put it on the bill.

350
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:50,801
My room is the last one
on the porch corridor...

351
00:33:51,394 --> 00:33:54,016
...in case he needs anything
during the night.

352
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:55,766
Thank you again.

353
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,143
Good night.

354
00:34:06,158 --> 00:34:08,280
Nordley come out of it yet?

355
00:34:09,118 --> 00:34:13,163
Yes. They're both feeling much better.

356
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:23,288
Two pretty girls in one week.

357
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,216
Kelly.

358
00:34:36,017 --> 00:34:40,394
I'm going to miss Kelly.
Kelly was all right.

359
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:43,136
I didn't say she wasn't, did I?

360
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:51,065
Take it easy going up them stairs.

361
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:54,694
Give me a bag. Throw me a bag up.

362
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:57,904
- Which one?
- The little one.

363
00:34:58,204 --> 00:34:59,697
Here you are.

364
00:35:00,664 --> 00:35:02,740
- There you are.
- Thank you.

365
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:06,377
Hold on, and I'll get the others up to you.

366
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:08,536
I've got hold of one more. You want that?

367
00:35:08,712 --> 00:35:10,788
- Leave it for Marswell.
- I've got it now.

368
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:12,708
I'm coming up the stair with it.

369
00:35:16,345 --> 00:35:18,004
You women and your bags.

370
00:35:19,722 --> 00:35:21,098
Hi there.

371
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:24,342
Anybody up on the old homestead?

372
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:27,389
Hi. The return of Frankenstein.

373
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:30,774
- What happened?
- Shipwrecked...

374
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:33,606
...and me without a desert island
to my name.

375
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:37,441
A catastrophe,
a bleeding bellyful of bad luck.

376
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:40,365
- He's stinking.
- How come? Where?

377
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:43,285
About three miles down the river,
the engine packs up.

378
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:46,239
The current got hold of us
and drifted us onto a mud bar.

379
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:48,489
What about the cages?
The animals all right?

380
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:51,333
They're all right.
We left the crew to look after them.

381
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,284
- We came here in the tender.
- Tender? I'll say it was.

382
00:35:55,463 --> 00:35:57,918
Hi, Brownie.
And in the dark too.

383
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,924
Any minute I expected to be
up to me hips in hippopotamuses.

384
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,836
You got me doing it now.

385
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:06,344
Could you send a couple of your boys
to the settlement with the news?

386
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:09,087
Boltchak, go get Muntala.

387
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,644
- Have a drink.
- Thank you, miss.

388
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:19,056
- How long will repairs take?
- No time at all.

389
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:21,356
Maybe a day after we
get the replacement.

390
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:24,101
It'll take us about three
or four weeks to get it.

391
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,106
Four weeks?

392
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:30,231
- Brownie, take him.
- Come on. Time for your nap.

393
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:34,365
Leon will bring the boys around for
a chat, they'll shove off in the morning.

394
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:36,495
Take the bottle with you.

395
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:41,377
Thank you, Mr. M.
Yeah, Brownie. Brownie!

396
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:46,960
I'm sorry.

397
00:36:51,929 --> 00:36:53,471
Just a minute.

398
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:58,643
Mr. and Mrs. Nordley are in that room.

399
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:02,061
I'll have Boltchak move in with Brownie.
You can take his room.

400
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,981
- He'll be back soon.
- Yeah, the scientific characters.

401
00:37:05,149 --> 00:37:09,146
They look kind of shiny new and young
to be scientific types, don't they?

402
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:13,399
- Yeah, but take it easy, will you?
- What do you mean?

403
00:37:16,743 --> 00:37:21,618
You know, Mrs. Nordley has led
a sheltered sort of life, I guess...

404
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:25,655
...and, well, let's not get too informal.
You know what I mean.

405
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,660
I know what you mean.

406
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:31,502
You have as much gallantry in that remark
as you think I've got brains.

407
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:34,045
- Now, wait a minute-
- Never mind.

408
00:37:34,675 --> 00:37:39,088
I'll just act like I was your sister,
down from Vassar for the holidays.

409
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:42,178
That was pretty lame talk.

410
00:37:43,182 --> 00:37:45,508
But you know what I'm talking about.

411
00:37:46,018 --> 00:37:51,356
It's possible that I have a slight inkling
as to your outlook on life.

412
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,870
Joe, get off my bed.

413
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:07,151
Scram!

414
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:25,709
Hi, baby. Come on, let me in.
Oh, come on.

415
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,671
Behave. Wait a minute, boy.
Wait.

416
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:34,096
Come on, now.
Hey, listen, save some for the little girl.

417
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:37,436
Wait a minute. Here, okay.

418
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:42,894
No, no. No more.

419
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,776
You're a nice little girl.

420
00:38:49,742 --> 00:38:52,576
Here's one. Hey, wait!

421
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,612
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

422
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:58,910
You're such a pig.
You don't deserve any more. No!

423
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:01,574
Now, if you're not such a pig,
I'll feed you.

424
00:39:04,046 --> 00:39:07,913
Here, little girl. Here, little girl.
Here, little girl. Here you are.

425
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:09,466
Here. Come on.

426
00:39:09,634 --> 00:39:11,507
No, no!

427
00:39:14,972 --> 00:39:16,597
Oh, hi.

428
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:19,600
How do you do?
My name is Mrs. Nordley.

429
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:22,603
I'm Kelly, Eloise Kelly.

430
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:24,894
I hear your husband isn't well.
Is he better?

431
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:27,555
- He's much, much better, thank you.
- That's good.

432
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,936
Mr. Marswell says
he's made a very quick recovery.

433
00:39:31,195 --> 00:39:33,864
Speaking of friend Marswell,
I wonder where he is.

434
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:37,233
Probably out lassoing
some ferocious gazelle or something.

435
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,482
He took the captain to the boat in a truck.

436
00:39:40,662 --> 00:39:43,496
Something about
bringing back the animals, I believe.

437
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:46,071
Boy, I wish I'd had a truck last night.

438
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:49,459
I haven't walked that far
since some palpitating halfback...

439
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:51,833
...tried to tell me he'd run out of gas.

440
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:55,627
You've been here on some sort of safari?

441
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,469
I was going on one,
or at least I thought I was.

442
00:39:58,636 --> 00:40:02,419
I came to visit an old pal of mine,
the Maharajah of Bunganore.

443
00:40:02,597 --> 00:40:04,222
- Do you mind?
- No.

444
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:08,227
But the big, thoughtless cad stood me up.

445
00:40:08,395 --> 00:40:10,303
- He stood you-?
- In Americanese...

446
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:13,101
...that means that when I got here
he wasn't here.

447
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:19,191
Men can get you into all sorts of trouble,
can't they?

448
00:40:21,322 --> 00:40:23,196
That was quite a shame.

449
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,867
When Marswell first heard about it,
he was furious...

450
00:40:27,035 --> 00:40:30,985
...but then he calmed down,
and he was kind of sweet about it.

451
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:33,656
He's kind of cute, I guess.

452
00:40:33,876 --> 00:40:35,499
He's a rough, mean man at times.

453
00:40:35,668 --> 00:40:39,500
I must get your husband
to examine his head, see what's inside.

454
00:40:41,382 --> 00:40:45,082
I hope the saga of my lonely travels
hasn't shocked you.

455
00:40:45,886 --> 00:40:50,595
I suppose girls are more conservative
up your way, aren't they?

456
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:55,014
With my husband almost well again,
I had it in mind to take a little walk...

457
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,262
...sort of get one's bearings.

458
00:40:57,772 --> 00:41:01,471
- Nice day for it.
- Well, so be it.

459
00:41:57,116 --> 00:42:01,195
Bless your big, bony knees.

460
00:42:04,414 --> 00:42:06,287
Hi, Kelly.

461
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:09,744
You're up early.

462
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:12,670
You know me, the neurotic type,
insomnia.

463
00:42:14,214 --> 00:42:16,622
Why didn't you tell a fella?
She's something.

464
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,464
She's the kind that makes men
want to break out of jail.

465
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:25,380
You been talking to Mrs. Nordley?

466
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:27,051
Well, now, look at him.

467
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:29,099
Knew to whom I was referring
right away.

468
00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:31,060
Yeah, me and my crystal ball.

469
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:34,432
You and your crystal head.
Wipe that Emily Post look off your face.

470
00:42:34,607 --> 00:42:36,729
I didn't endanger
your lily-white reputation.

471
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,774
- I said she's pretty.
- So she's pretty.

472
00:42:38,944 --> 00:42:41,779
What the blue blazes has that
to do with the price of pork?

473
00:42:41,947 --> 00:42:43,440
- She's nice too.
- Certainly.

474
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:46,865
- So she's nice. I said it first.
- Who cares who said it first?

475
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:51,780
- It might make her nicer if I said it first.
- All right. So you said it first.

476
00:42:52,456 --> 00:42:55,955
- I better look in on him.
- Nordley's peacefully pounding his ear.

477
00:42:56,126 --> 00:43:00,124
And not that you're interested,
but Mrs. Nordley has gone for a walk.

478
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:02,871
Gone for a walk? Where?

479
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:05,255
How should I know?

480
00:43:05,926 --> 00:43:08,797
How do you like that?
Why didn't you try to stop her?

481
00:43:08,971 --> 00:43:12,256
I had no idea people
couldn't go for a walk around here.

482
00:43:12,432 --> 00:43:15,349
Mrs. Nordley walks off in the bush
like it was Hyde Park.

483
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:19,385
Take the jeep and go down the
forest trail. I'll take the river road.

484
00:43:56,513 --> 00:43:59,051
Mrs. Nordley!

485
00:44:39,759 --> 00:44:42,844
Linda, don't move.

486
00:45:09,994 --> 00:45:13,944
Well, that's that.
Come on, let's go back to camp.

487
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:15,831
- I'm-
- Let's go.

488
00:45:18,668 --> 00:45:22,666
I've certainly won myself the reputation
for being an utter fool.

489
00:45:23,506 --> 00:45:26,543
I'm not so much worried
about your reputation as your health.

490
00:45:26,717 --> 00:45:29,837
If anything should happen to you,
my reputation would suffer.

491
00:45:30,012 --> 00:45:32,929
Doesn't a woman's reputation
mean anything to you?

492
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:35,174
Only if I'm personally interested.

493
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:40,884
Not very gracious, but understandable.

494
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:44,941
Donald will think I'm dreaming
when I tell him all this.

495
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:48,026
- Thank heavens you're a witness.
- Do you need one?

496
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,362
Donald's a husband who's believed
everything I've told him...

497
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:52,989
...since I was five years old.

498
00:45:53,157 --> 00:45:56,941
Five years old? You were married
rather young, weren't you?

499
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,789
Actually, we were married when I was 20.

500
00:46:00,164 --> 00:46:02,037
How long ago was that?

501
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:04,455
- Sorry.
- No, it's all right.

502
00:46:04,751 --> 00:46:08,036
I'm 27. Satisfied?

503
00:46:08,213 --> 00:46:09,920
You want me to forget it?

504
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:12,000
Not necessarily.

505
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,089
Have you ever been married?

506
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:18,302
I've never had the fortune
to find a lady who was interested.

507
00:46:18,471 --> 00:46:20,796
That could be the remark
of a cynical man.

508
00:46:20,973 --> 00:46:22,516
What have I to be cynical about?

509
00:46:22,684 --> 00:46:26,728
I make my contribution to this
mixed-up world. What else is there?

510
00:46:27,896 --> 00:46:31,395
That could be the remark
of a lonely man.

511
00:46:31,566 --> 00:46:33,061
Could be.

512
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,534
Looks like we're in for a little storm.

513
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,582
Let's go back to camp. Come on.

514
00:48:32,924 --> 00:48:35,249
- You've been out walking?
- Sure.

515
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:38,260
Better be careful.
Mrs. Nordley nearly got into trouble.

516
00:48:38,428 --> 00:48:40,006
- Did she?
- Yes.

517
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,386
She's under the delusion
she can wander off...

518
00:48:42,557 --> 00:48:44,596
...without being in any danger.

519
00:48:44,934 --> 00:48:47,507
From the wild animals, you mean.

520
00:48:48,396 --> 00:48:49,806
Certainly. What else?

521
00:48:50,606 --> 00:48:53,523
I don't know what happened
out in the bush...

522
00:48:53,942 --> 00:48:58,022
...but the lady seemed to be in danger
right here on the porch.

523
00:48:58,571 --> 00:49:00,647
You're seeing things, aren't you?

524
00:49:04,326 --> 00:49:05,571
Hi, Brownie.

525
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:08,488
A party!

526
00:49:08,872 --> 00:49:11,576
The Nordleys. It's their
first night here, so I thought-

527
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,576
Oh, yeah.

528
00:49:14,836 --> 00:49:16,663
Good evening.

529
00:49:17,672 --> 00:49:18,999
Feeling better?

530
00:49:19,172 --> 00:49:21,877
I just have to get my clothes changed.

531
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,960
Be right with you.

532
00:49:26,888 --> 00:49:29,260
Miss Kelly, this is my husband.

533
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:32,682
How do you do? Excuse me.
Gotta get dressed, you know.

534
00:49:34,645 --> 00:49:36,553
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

535
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:39,896
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

536
00:49:40,692 --> 00:49:43,562
- Who was the young girl?
- Miss Kelly.

537
00:49:43,737 --> 00:49:46,606
"Honey Bear. " American.

538
00:49:54,203 --> 00:49:57,288
Judging by your appetite,
you must be quite well again.

539
00:49:57,457 --> 00:50:00,030
I feel wonderful.
Thanks to you, Dr. Marswell.

540
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:04,206
And you look it. What's more, you've
brought culture to Marswell's circus.

541
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:07,380
I love the custom black tie
in the middle of the jungle.

542
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:11,008
Do you know that before you got here
we wore onion sacks?

543
00:50:12,553 --> 00:50:16,004
Anyone else wish to join me
in a little more of the grape?

544
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:18,266
Mrs. Nordley?

545
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:21,968
- It's good for the nerves, they tell me.
- No, thank you.

546
00:50:22,354 --> 00:50:24,476
- Mine host?
- No, thanks.

547
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,397
That's right. I forgot.

548
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:29,270
These animal-catching characters
don't have many nerves...

549
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,103
...just one great big one.

550
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,816
You seem to have a real fondness
for that wine.

551
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,733
Any year, any model.

552
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,658
They all bring out my better nature.

553
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,153
It was a pretty exciting afternoon.

554
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,321
I can't tell you, Vic....

555
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,248
You don't mind if it's Vic and Donald
from now on, do you?

556
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,373
- Why not?
- And "Honey Bear. "

557
00:50:49,795 --> 00:50:51,337
Oh, yes.

558
00:50:51,505 --> 00:50:54,873
I mean the luck in your getting back
in time to go after Linda.

559
00:50:55,049 --> 00:50:57,504
Old girl, you could
have had a very bad mauling.

560
00:50:59,261 --> 00:51:02,676
I hear you can get one anytime
in these parts...

561
00:51:02,847 --> 00:51:04,128
...if you ask for it.

562
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:08,430
- More coffee, Mrs. Nordley?
- No, thank you.

563
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:12,434
You must realize even the smallest
of creatures in Africa are voracious.

564
00:51:12,731 --> 00:51:16,681
I was reading only the other day
of an incident of the red driver ant.

565
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,319
It's a very tough insect.

566
00:51:18,487 --> 00:51:21,024
Some poor blighter left his launch
at the riverbank...

567
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:24,898
...and along came an army of these ants
and ate up everything but the engine.

568
00:51:25,076 --> 00:51:26,487
Good heavens.

569
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:29,945
We have hundreds of different varieties
of ants in this country.

570
00:51:30,122 --> 00:51:33,288
Oh, yes, I saw quite a few ants
this afternoon.

571
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:36,743
But I guess they were just
the old-fashioned kind, huh?

572
00:51:40,423 --> 00:51:42,249
All through, I guess.

573
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:49,513
Why don't we have some music
to soothe the savage breasts?

574
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:50,879
Do you play?

575
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:53,345
No, but you can pump
if you feel strong enough.

576
00:51:53,517 --> 00:51:56,090
- I see, it's one of those.
- Yes.

577
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:59,271
"Coming Through the Rye".
That's a bit of home.

578
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,938
- Are you in good voice, Miss Kelly?
- No, but I feel like singing.

579
00:52:03,443 --> 00:52:05,566
Give forth, then.

580
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,852
I say, that's absolutely delightful.

581
00:52:47,023 --> 00:52:49,431
I'm a reedy tenor,
but I'll join you in this verse.

582
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:52,645
- Wonderful. Brownie, let's make it a trio.
- Yes.

583
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,773
- A bunch of wailing banshees, huh?
- All right.

584
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:34,935
I don't wanna interrupt
but I thought you'd want to know.

585
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:38,855
If you're willing to start, I'd be
glad to take you to gorilla country.

586
00:53:39,027 --> 00:53:42,194
- Really? That's splendid.
- Provided you haven't changed your mind.

587
00:53:42,364 --> 00:53:45,814
Changed our minds?
Hear that, Linda? Isn't it wonderful?

588
00:53:46,242 --> 00:53:48,365
Yes, yes, simply wonderful.

589
00:53:48,536 --> 00:53:51,027
I was thinking of that letter
from Ringling Brothers.

590
00:53:51,205 --> 00:53:53,612
They offered a nice prize
for a pair of young ones.

591
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:56,495
I haven't been in gorilla country
for several years.

592
00:53:56,668 --> 00:53:59,871
It'll be a good change of that routine
you were telling me about.

593
00:54:00,046 --> 00:54:03,545
And since our two young guests
have it in their minds...

594
00:54:03,716 --> 00:54:06,420
...well, we could kill several birds
with one stone...

595
00:54:07,594 --> 00:54:09,219
...to coin a phrase.

596
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:13,262
I think it's absolutely wonderful.

597
00:54:13,474 --> 00:54:15,965
You'll pardon my schoolboy enthusiasm,
but you see...

598
00:54:16,144 --> 00:54:18,635
...Vic was so stubborn
about not taking us at first.

599
00:54:18,813 --> 00:54:22,347
Why, he's just an old
quick-change artist...

600
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:24,481
...but real quick.

601
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:28,268
Do you know that one minute
he can be Trader Horn himself...

602
00:54:28,446 --> 00:54:31,019
...and then suddenly
everything goes black...

603
00:54:31,198 --> 00:54:33,820
...and out he comes,
dressed as Dr. Livingstone...

604
00:54:33,993 --> 00:54:35,368
...I presume?

605
00:54:35,745 --> 00:54:37,487
Fortunate for us, I'd say.

606
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:40,364
Nobody will be surprised but the gorillas.

607
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:44,040
Miss Kelly can come with us
as far as the district officer at Kenya.

608
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:46,879
Don't worry about me.
I'll be quite all right.

609
00:54:47,254 --> 00:54:49,579
I'll sort of go into a monastic retreat...

610
00:54:49,757 --> 00:54:52,758
...and realize how beautiful life really is.

611
00:54:53,177 --> 00:54:56,627
We close up shop here except
for the boys looking after the animals.

612
00:54:56,804 --> 00:54:59,758
You'll have a six weeks' wait,
or even longer.

613
00:55:00,266 --> 00:55:03,634
We'll take her along as far
as the district officer at Kenya...

614
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,348
...and she can check out with his party.

615
00:55:07,856 --> 00:55:10,608
Yes, I guess that could be arranged.

616
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:14,975
In that case, you'll be on the plane
for Cairo within a week or ten days.

617
00:55:15,154 --> 00:55:17,443
Fine. The sooner the better...

618
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:19,822
...to coin a phrase.

619
00:55:26,331 --> 00:55:30,114
I saw your light.
I thought you weren't asleep yet.

620
00:55:31,669 --> 00:55:33,708
When do you plan to start?

621
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:37,245
We can be ready in about two days.

622
00:55:38,091 --> 00:55:41,294
Full safari, I suppose.
Entire complement of boys.

623
00:55:42,178 --> 00:55:43,506
Naturally.

624
00:55:43,972 --> 00:55:47,636
You know this will delay the Dorgenbeck
and the Chicago Zoo order.

625
00:55:47,808 --> 00:55:50,927
We can fill it quick enough
when we get back.

626
00:55:57,191 --> 00:56:01,236
Vic, lad, that's a nice couple.

627
00:56:01,612 --> 00:56:03,236
This is no good.

628
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:07,232
What are you talking about?

629
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,781
Nothing. Getting old, I'm afraid.

630
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:12,078
Good night.

631
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:27,923
Are they all Muntala's wives?

632
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,590
No, just six. The other three are cooking.

633
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,091
No kidding?

634
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,923
Yep, no kidding. Let's go.

635
00:57:24,393 --> 00:57:26,018
Fascinating, eh, darling?

636
00:57:26,228 --> 00:57:29,312
It's amazing. Look, what is that?

637
00:57:30,231 --> 00:57:33,268
- Some sort of stork?
- Secretary bird.

638
00:57:34,152 --> 00:57:37,485
Secretary birds. What a prosaic name.

639
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:41,571
- Why do they call them that?
- That's an unfair question.

640
00:57:41,742 --> 00:57:43,236
I haven't the slightest idea.

641
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:47,617
That secretary on the left has a pair
of legs for the boss to drool over.

642
00:57:47,789 --> 00:57:50,196
She looks like she's been chased
around the desk...

643
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:52,248
...and is now headed
for the pay window.

644
00:57:52,418 --> 00:57:54,955
Miss Kelly, we shall certainly hate
to lose you.

645
00:57:55,128 --> 00:57:56,920
Now, don't be greedy.

646
00:57:57,339 --> 00:57:59,877
Let the others speak for themselves.

647
00:58:00,968 --> 00:58:03,884
- Just what is our schedule?
- It's down the same stretch...

648
00:58:04,053 --> 00:58:06,805
...for another two days
until we reach the river here.

649
00:58:06,973 --> 00:58:09,760
There the Makuas will give us
canoes and paddle boys...

650
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:12,850
...where we'll proceed downriver
till we reach Kenya station.

651
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:14,811
At Kenya station,
we contact Jack Wood.

652
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,387
He's the district officer
of the Samburu territory.

653
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:18,764
The Samburus!

654
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:21,432
Those are the chaps
I particularly want to visit.

655
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:24,232
And that, Mrs. Nordley,
is where I leave you all.

656
00:58:24,405 --> 00:58:26,231
You all.

657
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:31,692
- No tears?
- We'll give you a going-away party.

658
00:58:31,869 --> 00:58:33,494
- Thank you.
- Where then?

659
00:58:33,663 --> 00:58:36,866
Then we'll proceed on foot
to the Mountains of the Moon.

660
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:38,949
That's the beginning of gorilla country.

661
00:58:39,126 --> 00:58:40,584
Look, what are those?

662
00:58:42,045 --> 00:58:43,243
Impala.

663
00:58:43,922 --> 00:58:46,377
What simply exquisite creatures.

664
00:58:47,133 --> 00:58:50,881
- You'd think they had wings.
- It's the Aepyceros Melampus Suara.

665
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:55,341
They can clear a 12-foot obstacle
with a leap as long as 35, 40 feet.

666
00:58:55,515 --> 00:58:58,053
You mustn't take the megaphone
away from the driver.

667
00:58:58,226 --> 00:59:00,302
We'll pass Grant's Tomb
any moment now.

668
00:59:00,478 --> 00:59:03,229
- He'll tell you who's buried there.
- I beg your pardon?

669
00:59:03,397 --> 00:59:05,722
There's a handsome animal for you.

670
00:59:05,899 --> 00:59:07,477
Thompson gazelle.

671
00:59:07,985 --> 00:59:09,230
Lovely.

672
00:59:11,238 --> 00:59:14,902
Who's the Mr. Thompson famous enough
to have a gazelle named after him?

673
00:59:15,074 --> 00:59:18,526
He's a third baseman.
Hit a home run for the Giants once.

674
00:59:18,703 --> 00:59:20,741
Won the pennant.

675
00:59:20,912 --> 00:59:23,486
Miss Kelly, we'll give you
two going-away parties.

676
00:59:25,292 --> 00:59:27,961
Well, I've got one for you.
See those zebras over there?

677
00:59:29,462 --> 00:59:33,376
- Yes. The Equus Burchelli Granti.
- To me, they're zebras.

678
00:59:33,549 --> 00:59:36,883
Are they born white with black stripes
or black with white stripes?

679
00:59:37,053 --> 00:59:39,424
Actually, they're born black with....

680
00:59:41,097 --> 00:59:43,007
I'm going on, aren't I?

681
00:59:44,434 --> 00:59:48,727
Mrs. Nordley, this is quite a nice,
bright husband you have.

682
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:53,183
Information I'm already well aware of.

683
00:59:53,692 --> 00:59:58,152
But I assure you that outside
of his niceness and his brightness...

684
00:59:58,321 --> 01:00:00,894
...there are many other reasons
why I'm in love with him.

685
01:00:01,074 --> 01:00:02,947
Thank you, old girl.

686
01:00:03,575 --> 01:00:05,900
I'd say he was a very lucky man.

687
01:00:50,909 --> 01:00:54,953
Better turn in early. We'll start at 5:00
in the morning to miss the heat.

688
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:57,612
Here. Hang on to this.

689
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:00,281
It's loaded.
All you have to do is pull the trigger.

690
01:01:00,459 --> 01:01:02,535
Who do I point this at?

691
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:06,080
Leopards and lions have been known
to come into tents.

692
01:01:06,715 --> 01:01:08,624
Thank you, Mr. Marswell.

693
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,133
Actually, in light of recent development...

694
01:01:12,303 --> 01:01:15,422
...there'll be no danger of my
hitting you, will there?

695
01:01:15,764 --> 01:01:19,679
- Look, Kelly, don't. We know each other-
- Never mind, Marswell.

696
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:23,012
It was just a dumb crack
that doubled right back at me.

697
01:01:23,688 --> 01:01:26,060
Boy, how stupid can a gal get?

698
01:01:28,526 --> 01:01:30,150
Good night, Kelly.

699
01:01:31,194 --> 01:01:33,068
Good night.

700
01:01:43,998 --> 01:01:47,864
- Everything all right? Anything you need?
- Everything's just fine, thank you.

701
01:01:48,043 --> 01:01:51,992
- Good night, then.
- Just a moment, will you, please?

702
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:59,300
For several days now,
Miss Kelly's been making...

703
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,716
...well, at least, insinuations.

704
01:02:04,098 --> 01:02:05,641
I wouldn't let her upset me.

705
01:02:05,808 --> 01:02:07,766
She'll be leaving us at Kenya station.

706
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:10,473
What would give her the right
to say things like that?

707
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:12,638
She saw us when we
walked up on the porch.

708
01:02:17,027 --> 01:02:19,862
You must forget that,
that it ever happened.

709
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:22,154
It was just....

710
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:25,905
- Well, it was nothing.
- You want me to forget it?

711
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:30,739
That's why you changed your mind
about taking us on this trip.

712
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,906
Plus you're not in love
with your husband.

713
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,408
- You mustn't say that!
- Though you said you were.

714
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,122
- I know why you said it.
- I said it because it's true.

715
01:02:38,295 --> 01:02:40,751
I am in love with Donald.

716
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,838
You asked me why I never married.

717
01:02:46,178 --> 01:02:48,964
Maybe you yourself are the reason, Linda.

718
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,264
Linda.

719
01:02:56,979 --> 01:02:59,386
I'll see you in the morning.

720
01:03:00,649 --> 01:03:04,147
Hello, Vic. I just won 15 shillings
in a poker game. Meet my expenses.

721
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:05,943
- Good.
- Good night.

722
01:03:09,782 --> 01:03:11,110
I'm tired.

723
01:03:12,909 --> 01:03:16,278
Looks like the start
of some exciting weeks, eh, darling?

724
01:03:16,788 --> 01:03:19,030
- Lin?
- What?

725
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:21,243
Of course, darling.

726
01:03:21,417 --> 01:03:24,453
That Kelly girl is certainly a different type
from any I've met.

727
01:03:25,296 --> 01:03:28,047
Wonderful sense of humor. I like her.

728
01:03:29,257 --> 01:03:31,296
And it's perfectly obvious, of course.

729
01:03:32,385 --> 01:03:33,844
What is?

730
01:03:34,012 --> 01:03:37,297
There was a thing between her and Vic
before we arrived.

731
01:03:37,473 --> 01:03:42,016
And now we are the villains.
In some odd way we've broken it up.

732
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:46,230
Not that I blame her, of course.
Vic's a devilishly attractive chap.

733
01:03:46,398 --> 01:03:49,766
Don't you think so? As a woman?

734
01:03:50,776 --> 01:03:52,650
I suppose so.

735
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:56,232
All I know is I'm glad you saw me first.

736
01:04:00,702 --> 01:04:03,407
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Donald.

737
01:05:26,236 --> 01:05:27,896
Welcome, Victor.

738
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,777
- How are you, Victor?
- Fine, thank you.

739
01:05:34,952 --> 01:05:36,695
- How do you do?
- Hello, Father.

740
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:38,577
Mr. and Mrs. Nordley
from England.

741
01:05:38,746 --> 01:05:40,406
How do you do, Father?

742
01:05:55,636 --> 01:05:59,301
Your music is wonderful, Father,
although it frightened me at first.

743
01:05:59,473 --> 01:06:03,423
It's hardly Catholic. But it's a song
of welcome, and that's Christian.

744
01:06:03,603 --> 01:06:06,805
We're just in time for lunch.
Brownie, you're not still on a diet?

745
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,439
Never, Father.

746
01:06:17,364 --> 01:06:19,820
- Miss Kelly, Father Josef.
- How do you do?

747
01:06:19,992 --> 01:06:21,450
How do you do?

748
01:06:21,826 --> 01:06:24,115
You're just in time for lunch.

749
01:06:26,748 --> 01:06:29,701
So you good people are going
to the gorilla country?

750
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:31,417
Precarious animals.

751
01:06:31,585 --> 01:06:34,337
A friend of mine at mission preparatory...

752
01:06:34,504 --> 01:06:37,209
...had his head torn from his body
by one of them beasts.

753
01:06:37,382 --> 01:06:39,255
That was carelessness,
you know that.

754
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:42,509
We're relying on Victor
to see that we retain our heads.

755
01:06:42,929 --> 01:06:45,764
I can't wait to see them
in their natural habitat.

756
01:06:45,932 --> 01:06:49,845
The truest exemplary link between
modern man and his primitive derivation.

757
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:55,354
I think you and I could have a lusty debate
on the origin of man.

758
01:06:55,814 --> 01:06:58,352
I'm afraid you'd prove too rugged
an opponent, Father.

759
01:06:58,525 --> 01:06:59,984
I spoke to the chief...

760
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:03,984
...and you can have the canoes
and the men on the usual conditions.

761
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:09,111
- Not again.
- I'm afraid so, Victor.

762
01:07:09,661 --> 01:07:11,986
What are the conditions?
Is there any trouble?

763
01:07:12,163 --> 01:07:15,780
In order to get the men and canoes
to go into that strange country...

764
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:19,457
...the bwana mkubwa, the big chief,
the party of the first part...

765
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:23,038
...to which our friend Victor
must undergo what's known as...

766
01:07:23,214 --> 01:07:25,171
...the ceremony of courage.

767
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,669
The ceremony of courage?

768
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:30,756
I don't think I've heard of it.
What is it, some sort of native custom?

769
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:33,052
It's sort of like a game of darts.

770
01:07:33,515 --> 01:07:34,843
Excuse me.

771
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,436
I'm sorry.

772
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,905
That's a fine way to run a railroad, buster.

773
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:43,691
That's all right.
All right, Boltchak, load the boat.

774
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,746
Come on, we've got the canoes. Let's go.

775
01:08:49,957 --> 01:08:53,955
Father, I'd like to speak to you a moment
when you have a chance.

776
01:08:54,295 --> 01:08:56,867
- Certainly, my daughter.
- Thank you, Father.

777
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:43,545
Darling.

778
01:09:46,091 --> 01:09:49,922
This is the jumping-off place.
Do you want to go on or turn back?

779
01:09:50,094 --> 01:09:52,252
What on earth makes you say that?

780
01:09:52,429 --> 01:09:55,963
You're taking me seriously.
I'd as soon turn back as....

781
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:59,177
Do you feel all right?

782
01:09:59,352 --> 01:10:02,057
I'm sorry. I'm just a bit edgy.

783
01:10:02,814 --> 01:10:04,474
I didn't sleep too well.

784
01:10:04,648 --> 01:10:06,973
I know. It was an exciting evening.

785
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:08,858
You take a sedative tonight.

786
01:10:09,027 --> 01:10:10,937
Get in the swing of things, darling.

787
01:10:11,113 --> 01:10:14,362
With the world the way it is,
we may never have this chance again.

788
01:10:14,532 --> 01:10:16,738
Let's live every minute of it.

789
01:10:30,213 --> 01:10:31,671
Good morning.

790
01:10:32,506 --> 01:10:34,997
I know everybody's in a terrible rush
this morning...

791
01:10:35,176 --> 01:10:38,093
...but I thought perhaps
we could have a few words together.

792
01:10:38,262 --> 01:10:39,292
Yes?

793
01:10:41,014 --> 01:10:45,225
I've been the champion of female
Airedales and I'd like to apologize.

794
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:49,010
What on earth for?
I assure you, there's nothing-

795
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:52,183
I'm feeling a great deal better
about life today.

796
01:10:52,357 --> 01:10:53,852
So let's level, shall we?

797
01:10:54,484 --> 01:10:56,856
I'm not blaming you by apologizing.

798
01:10:57,153 --> 01:11:00,853
I'd just like to tell you
that I know how it is with you and Vic.

799
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:05,531
We girls are pretty smart
about those things, aren't we?

800
01:11:05,785 --> 01:11:08,276
Aren't you being presumptuous
in assuming any-

801
01:11:08,455 --> 01:11:11,206
Please, honey,
don't let me sit here with egg on my face.

802
01:11:11,374 --> 01:11:13,082
I came here to be your friend.

803
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:16,785
The only way I know how
is to tell you that I understand.

804
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:20,163
It can happen.
He's an attractive burglar-

805
01:11:20,341 --> 01:11:23,709
Really, if you'll excuse me,
I must finish my packing.

806
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,254
All right. I'll get out.
But keep your head, will you?

807
01:11:29,015 --> 01:11:32,181
You're sitting pretty.
You're a lovely, attractive woman.

808
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:34,142
You're married to a wonderful man.

809
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:36,767
Is it possible that all of this advice...

810
01:11:36,939 --> 01:11:39,974
...is based on the fact
that you know Mr. Marswell...

811
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:43,103
...just a little more intimately
than I do?

812
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:45,689
Gosh, you are stuck, aren't you?

813
01:11:45,863 --> 01:11:48,270
- Once and for all-
- You're jealous.

814
01:11:48,448 --> 01:11:51,615
Shouldn't you examine
your own emotions in that light?

815
01:11:51,785 --> 01:11:55,201
Don't worry about me.
I could be pea green with jealousy...

816
01:11:55,372 --> 01:11:58,158
...and not hacked up any more
than I am already.

817
01:11:58,332 --> 01:12:00,241
It's you we want to worry about.

818
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:03,335
This is no Sir Galahad
who loves from afar.

819
01:12:03,712 --> 01:12:07,412
- This is a two-legged boa constrictor.
- I think you'd better leave.

820
01:12:08,258 --> 01:12:11,591
All right, but remember,
I came here to be your friend.

821
01:12:11,845 --> 01:12:13,255
For your sake.

822
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:16,379
And I'm keeping the offer open.

823
01:12:18,559 --> 01:12:20,966
It'll be rugged, but I'll keep it open.

824
01:12:32,988 --> 01:12:36,357
Go in the boat with Brownie.
I'll take Mrs. Nordley in the lead boat.

825
01:12:36,533 --> 01:12:38,609
But wouldn't it be better if...?

826
01:12:38,785 --> 01:12:40,492
- Do you mind, darling?
- Not at all.

827
01:12:40,661 --> 01:12:43,033
That's just in case of emergency.

828
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,394
Are the men of this tribe
also polygamists like Muntala?

829
01:14:04,653 --> 01:14:07,107
Only those who can afford
more than one wife.

830
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:10,529
It seems unfair to take them away
from their families.

831
01:14:10,699 --> 01:14:12,941
You mean the men are taking a chance?

832
01:14:16,579 --> 01:14:18,951
I'm quite sure that's what I mean.

833
01:14:19,123 --> 01:14:21,994
No. The natives have
all sorts of devices...

834
01:14:22,168 --> 01:14:24,409
...to prevent their women
from being stolen.

835
01:14:24,586 --> 01:14:26,828
In most tribes
there's a pre-marriage ordeal...

836
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:28,749
...that guarantees fidelity.

837
01:14:28,924 --> 01:14:31,379
Really? What's that, pray?

838
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:33,880
Let's see if I can-

839
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,713
Linda, look.

840
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,429
Isn't he beautiful?

841
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,055
Perfect specimen.

842
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:47,349
He's clean too.
Just had his Saturday night bath.

843
01:14:47,732 --> 01:14:49,641
Look!

844
01:14:54,572 --> 01:14:56,812
Reminds me of somebody I know.

845
01:14:57,532 --> 01:15:02,194
You were saying about this device
for guaranteed fidelity....

846
01:15:03,121 --> 01:15:05,872
Why wouldn't it pass
in the civilized world?

847
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:09,243
Primarily because you women
would probably vote it down.

848
01:15:09,418 --> 01:15:10,580
But why?

849
01:15:17,133 --> 01:15:21,462
Because it's a means whereby a woman
is rendered incapable of being unfaithful.

850
01:15:24,723 --> 01:15:27,807
- I think I understand.
- Sorry to be so blunt about it.

851
01:15:27,976 --> 01:15:31,676
No. It was my denseness.
I should have realized.

852
01:15:32,396 --> 01:15:35,765
Brother, I can take your Cook's tour
around the zoo...

853
01:15:36,317 --> 01:15:38,559
...but when we get on this mental
striptease...

854
01:15:38,736 --> 01:15:40,609
...and hide behind
Louisa May Alcott...

855
01:15:40,778 --> 01:15:42,189
...I want a powder.

856
01:15:42,363 --> 01:15:45,151
Brownie. Watch it. Hippo.

857
01:15:57,627 --> 01:16:00,034
Kenya, heart of the Samburu.

858
01:16:01,214 --> 01:16:03,621
I'm terribly keen on seeing those chaps.

859
01:16:03,799 --> 01:16:06,716
There doesn't appear
to be a committee to welcome us.

860
01:16:13,099 --> 01:16:16,135
Brownie, looks like this is
where I leave you.

861
01:16:17,895 --> 01:16:20,184
I'm glad somebody's glum about it.

862
01:18:40,753 --> 01:18:42,662
It's Vic. Vic Marswell.

863
01:18:44,131 --> 01:18:47,085
Get your party out of here fast.

864
01:18:48,177 --> 01:18:50,667
- What happened?
- Caught them ivory poaching.

865
01:18:51,763 --> 01:18:56,508
When the corporal was taking
down the colors last night...

866
01:18:57,018 --> 01:18:58,180
...they came at us.

867
01:18:58,352 --> 01:19:02,350
- Where are the rest of your men?
- Got two of them out last night.

868
01:19:02,982 --> 01:19:06,065
It'll take several days
before police reserves arrive.

869
01:19:07,026 --> 01:19:08,900
Get your party out quick.

870
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:12,521
These two.... Good boys.

871
01:19:14,117 --> 01:19:15,943
Don't bother about me.

872
01:19:16,869 --> 01:19:18,067
I've had it.

873
01:21:29,027 --> 01:21:32,312
There are gorillas. Three or four
families in the next valley.

874
01:21:32,488 --> 01:21:36,153
- How do you know they'll stay?
- I don't. These people are great trackers.

875
01:21:36,325 --> 01:21:38,651
We'll start out first thing in the morning.

876
01:21:38,828 --> 01:21:39,990
Thanks.

877
01:21:58,511 --> 01:22:00,883
- Good evening.
- Hi, Brownie.

878
01:22:02,348 --> 01:22:04,507
Sit down and join the picnic.

879
01:22:11,231 --> 01:22:14,766
You know me well enough now
to tell me about your scars?

880
01:22:18,779 --> 01:22:20,487
Nothing new, Brownie.

881
01:22:20,656 --> 01:22:23,147
Happens to lots of people.

882
01:22:28,038 --> 01:22:31,537
We'd just been married three weeks
when Johnny had to sail...

883
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:34,957
...and two months later I get a telegraph
from the War Department...

884
01:22:35,127 --> 01:22:37,701
...telling me that he and his little P-51....

885
01:22:38,797 --> 01:22:41,963
You know, he had "Honey Bear"
painted on the nose.

886
01:22:43,176 --> 01:22:47,339
Anyway, they both blew up
in a million pieces somewhere over Berlin.

887
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:54,052
You know, as short as it lasted,
it was like being blessed for a lifetime.

888
01:22:54,978 --> 01:22:58,642
So you hit the high spots
and the gay beaches trying to forget him?

889
01:22:59,357 --> 01:23:02,274
Yeah. Great strength of character.

890
01:23:03,528 --> 01:23:05,900
But you'd know it if you met it again.

891
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:08,737
I say, you'd know it
if you met it again.

892
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:12,194
Yes, Brownie, I'd know it.

893
01:23:27,882 --> 01:23:30,338
- Look.
- Flamingos.

894
01:23:57,576 --> 01:23:59,152
- Gorillas.
- What?

895
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,030
Gorilla country.

896
01:25:14,185 --> 01:25:16,853
It's nice up here, isn't it? High.

897
01:25:21,608 --> 01:25:23,814
Yes, it is nice, for a change.

898
01:25:31,117 --> 01:25:32,775
I don't like mosquito netting.

899
01:25:33,409 --> 01:25:35,698
It separates people, doesn't it?

900
01:25:36,412 --> 01:25:40,457
Donald, please.
I've got to fix these things.

901
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,373
Perhaps it's altitude,
but I feel very lightheaded.

902
01:25:44,545 --> 01:25:48,542
- Don't you feel the least bit lightheaded?
- Don't, Donald, please.

903
01:25:53,052 --> 01:25:54,381
I'm sorry.

904
01:25:55,263 --> 01:25:57,670
I'm sorry, darling. It's nothing.

905
01:25:58,141 --> 01:26:00,713
It's just that I'm terribly tired.

906
01:26:01,476 --> 01:26:04,513
That long climb today. I don't know....

907
01:26:06,648 --> 01:26:10,063
Come now, we've got a very
early start in the morning.

908
01:26:10,234 --> 01:26:13,021
I don't know if I'll quite feel up to it.

909
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:17,612
Donald, please turn that light off.
It's shining straight in my eyes.

910
01:26:17,782 --> 01:26:19,063
Right now.

911
01:26:22,328 --> 01:26:23,787
Lin, darling.

912
01:26:24,872 --> 01:26:26,532
You still my girl?

913
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:30,125
Don't be so childish.

914
01:26:31,837 --> 01:26:33,875
That's good enough for me.

915
01:27:13,624 --> 01:27:16,789
Why don't you come along?
You might find gorillas interesting.

916
01:27:16,959 --> 01:27:18,122
Gorillas?

917
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:21,746
A month ago,
I was buying a bra at Macy's.

918
01:27:21,923 --> 01:27:24,626
Now I'm studying gorillas yet.
No, thank you.

919
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,504
I'll stick around and help Muntala cook.

920
01:27:30,597 --> 01:27:32,175
What did he say?

921
01:27:32,682 --> 01:27:35,386
He says you can't even cook.

922
01:28:05,628 --> 01:28:07,501
Gorilla. Lots of them.

923
01:28:28,106 --> 01:28:30,395
- Is the battery ready?
- Yeah.

924
01:29:29,202 --> 01:29:31,574
I didn't know they could climb trees.

925
01:29:32,538 --> 01:29:34,411
Only the young ones do.

926
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:07,936
Donald, camera.

927
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:13,648
Ready to photograph a bull gorilla?

928
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:17,030
Why, yes. Wonderful.

929
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,495
Brownie, cover us.

930
01:31:33,811 --> 01:31:35,009
Don't move back.

931
01:31:35,813 --> 01:31:37,355
Don't budge an inch.

932
01:31:39,358 --> 01:31:40,438
Hold still.

933
01:31:41,569 --> 01:31:43,027
He's trying to bluff us.

934
01:31:47,032 --> 01:31:49,605
Bring your camera up slowly.

935
01:32:05,965 --> 01:32:08,123
- Brownie.
- What, chief?

936
01:32:15,766 --> 01:32:18,635
- Watch the young bull.
- Got him.

937
01:33:44,469 --> 01:33:48,253
There's the one
we want to pick up tomorrow.

938
01:33:57,731 --> 01:34:00,137
That's the last we'll see of them today.

939
01:34:00,775 --> 01:34:04,819
The boys can keep track of them tonight,
and we'll bring up the nets tomorrow.

940
01:34:10,241 --> 01:34:12,530
This is the film and one of the reels.

941
01:34:12,702 --> 01:34:15,703
Will you take them back
and keep them somewhere cool?

942
01:34:15,872 --> 01:34:18,279
- Precious stuff.
- Of course.

943
01:34:18,457 --> 01:34:20,331
Think you got anything
with that camera?

944
01:34:20,501 --> 01:34:24,450
I hope so,
but I must admit I was pretty scared.

945
01:34:25,379 --> 01:34:27,917
- Frightened to death.
- You were scared?

946
01:34:29,175 --> 01:34:31,796
I'll never forget the first one I saw.

947
01:34:32,512 --> 01:34:35,346
- Linda was all right too.
- You hear that, darling?

948
01:34:35,847 --> 01:34:37,674
They're a strange beast, gorilla.

949
01:34:37,849 --> 01:34:41,053
You can bluff them sometimes,
and then sometimes....

950
01:34:41,228 --> 01:34:43,136
We'll see tomorrow, when we net them.

951
01:34:43,312 --> 01:34:46,646
Is it all right for me to stay up overnight
and get some night sounds?

952
01:34:46,816 --> 01:34:50,896
Of course. It's not going to be
very comfortable for Linda, though.

953
01:34:53,154 --> 01:34:57,733
I don't exactly want to get rid of you,
but you don't mind, do you?

954
01:34:59,285 --> 01:35:01,324
No, of course not, Donald.

955
01:35:02,371 --> 01:35:04,529
You stay up here with Donald.
Do you mind?

956
01:35:04,706 --> 01:35:07,707
- Just as you say.
- Keep whatever boys you want.

957
01:35:08,126 --> 01:35:10,165
- Boltchak?
- No.

958
01:35:10,712 --> 01:35:13,000
I like my comforts in life too.

959
01:35:23,014 --> 01:35:24,259
Darling.

960
01:35:44,575 --> 01:35:46,698
If you're looking for Vic...

961
01:35:46,869 --> 01:35:50,534
...he's taking a walk with Mrs. Nordley.

962
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:20,761
Do you realize that just from the way
I can't stop myself looking at you...

963
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:24,475
- ...that everybody knows?
- Everybody but Donald.

964
01:36:26,445 --> 01:36:30,063
- At times I feel like-
- I know. I feel it myself.

965
01:36:30,991 --> 01:36:33,447
But he has to be told, that's all.

966
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:36,867
I don't know how to tell him.

967
01:36:42,918 --> 01:36:46,084
You stay in camp tomorrow.
I'm going up the hill.

968
01:36:50,509 --> 01:36:53,758
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

969
01:37:48,184 --> 01:37:50,806
Mind if I join the marshmallow roast?

970
01:37:52,771 --> 01:37:54,230
No. Sit down.

971
01:37:55,315 --> 01:37:58,233
Did you have a nice moonlight
constitutional?

972
01:37:59,611 --> 01:38:03,026
- Very pleasant.
- "Pleasant," the man says.

973
01:38:03,406 --> 01:38:05,398
At least that's gallantry.

974
01:38:12,581 --> 01:38:14,289
It's none of my business...

975
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:18,328
...but old Donzy boy
is not such a bad shot.

976
01:38:18,502 --> 01:38:22,500
And he'd be well within his rights
if he suddenly decided to take home...

977
01:38:22,673 --> 01:38:24,915
...a little trophy from this paper chase.

978
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:31,472
As a matter of fact, your head would look
pretty decorative over his mantelpiece.

979
01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:35,553
With your big ears stuck out
like an elephant about to charge.

980
01:38:38,228 --> 01:38:41,229
Get off my back, Kelly.
I'm in no mood for it.

981
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:43,892
You mean that?

982
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:49,477
Vic, look at me.

983
01:38:51,032 --> 01:38:53,736
This is no hit-and-run this time, is it?

984
01:38:54,743 --> 01:38:56,118
You're really in love.

985
01:38:57,037 --> 01:38:58,697
You better go to bed.

986
01:39:03,417 --> 01:39:05,576
All right. I guess that's it.

987
01:39:08,671 --> 01:39:13,215
I don't know how you'll solve this
or what good is going to come of it...

988
01:39:15,136 --> 01:39:18,800
...but whatever you do, Vic,
I wish you all the happiness in the book.

989
01:39:32,944 --> 01:39:34,567
Go on to bed, kid.

990
01:39:55,046 --> 01:39:57,964
Black king. What do I want
with an old black king?

991
01:39:59,175 --> 01:40:03,468
Okay. Let him go. He'll find out.
Little boy with a Daisy air rifle.

992
01:40:03,637 --> 01:40:05,677
"And, gee, Dad, it was just my size! "

993
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:08,356
Brownie. You and Boltchak
check the nets on the other side.

994
01:41:42,058 --> 01:41:43,385
The nets wobble.

995
01:41:48,730 --> 01:41:52,098
That net's falling apart back there.
You know that, don't you?

996
01:42:11,333 --> 01:42:14,120
You sure you still want
to go through with this?

997
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:16,038
Certainly, Vic.

998
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:19,750
It might be a little dangerous, you know.

999
01:42:20,758 --> 01:42:23,593
The old ones are sure to charge the net
when they....

1000
01:42:23,761 --> 01:42:27,805
Brownie's around and they're trying
to rope a young one for you.

1001
01:42:30,726 --> 01:42:32,552
- Donald.
- Yes, Vic?

1002
01:42:34,771 --> 01:42:37,641
- I want to talk to you.
- Just a minute, Vic.

1003
01:43:00,252 --> 01:43:02,208
- Cigarette?
- Yes, thanks.

1004
01:43:03,963 --> 01:43:06,252
We might as well
make ourselves comfortable.

1005
01:43:06,424 --> 01:43:08,713
This may take five minutes,
it may take an hour.

1006
01:43:08,885 --> 01:43:11,007
Depends on their disposition.

1007
01:43:11,219 --> 01:43:15,264
- We can sit here and talk.
- Good. We haven't had much opportunity.

1008
01:43:16,558 --> 01:43:19,760
When I admire a fellow
I always like to get to know him better...

1009
01:43:19,935 --> 01:43:22,473
...exchange points of view and all that.

1010
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:25,768
I like to have everything aboveboard too.

1011
01:43:25,941 --> 01:43:28,147
I'm glad to have
this opportunity of saying...

1012
01:43:28,318 --> 01:43:31,687
...that I think that everything's
been handled simply magnificently.

1013
01:43:32,155 --> 01:43:35,321
Things haven't gone off
exactly like they might have, but-

1014
01:43:35,491 --> 01:43:39,868
Truly, this will be one of the most
memorable experiences of my life.

1015
01:43:40,204 --> 01:43:41,698
It's only that....

1016
01:43:41,872 --> 01:43:44,492
I'm disappointed for Linda's sake,
that's all.

1017
01:43:45,375 --> 01:43:46,620
What about Linda?

1018
01:43:46,793 --> 01:43:50,162
Her not coming up today,
not feeling up to it and all.

1019
01:43:50,963 --> 01:43:54,663
I realize now that much as I
enjoy this sort of thing...

1020
01:43:55,008 --> 01:43:57,250
...field trips, roughing it, so to speak...

1021
01:43:58,261 --> 01:43:59,839
...it's not for Linda at all.

1022
01:44:02,139 --> 01:44:05,888
- She wanted to come up, but I told her-
- Yes, I know. She's been wonderful...

1023
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:10,187
...making her pretenses in enjoying it.
But that's for my sake, you know.

1024
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:15,438
She's been so moody of late,
almost irritable once or twice.

1025
01:44:15,902 --> 01:44:18,902
And believe me, Vic,
that's not like Linda at all.

1026
01:44:19,488 --> 01:44:23,700
The night before last she even forgot
it was our wedding anniversary.

1027
01:44:23,867 --> 01:44:26,654
That's usually the husband's blunder,
you know.

1028
01:44:26,828 --> 01:44:28,867
No, these trips aren't for Linda.

1029
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:32,415
I suppose it's home in Devonshire
from now on...

1030
01:44:32,875 --> 01:44:35,745
...raising that family
sooner than I expected.

1031
01:44:40,674 --> 01:44:44,124
Forgive me if I tell you
how much I'm in love with her.

1032
01:44:50,766 --> 01:44:52,674
Do I have to forgive you for that?

1033
01:44:52,851 --> 01:44:56,385
Seriously. It's been great to become
friends with a fellow like you.

1034
01:44:56,563 --> 01:44:58,472
We're so different, you see.

1035
01:44:58,732 --> 01:45:02,859
I imagine you've had to rub and sweat,
even for every penny you've made...

1036
01:45:03,027 --> 01:45:05,862
...and everything you've
wanted to build. Me?

1037
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:09,730
I'm one of those
silver-spoon chaps, I suppose.

1038
01:45:11,784 --> 01:45:13,694
I've been spouting
a whole autobiography.

1039
01:45:14,162 --> 01:45:16,320
Tell me something about yourself.

1040
01:45:16,497 --> 01:45:19,118
To begin with,
if I'm not too beastly inquisitive...

1041
01:45:19,291 --> 01:45:21,829
...we have wondered why
an attractive chap like you...

1042
01:45:22,002 --> 01:45:23,626
...has never got himself a wife.

1043
01:45:29,383 --> 01:45:32,005
I've been too busy collecting animals.

1044
01:45:33,554 --> 01:45:34,669
He's coming out now.

1045
01:45:34,847 --> 01:45:36,755
Stop talking
and watch what you came for.

1046
01:46:41,364 --> 01:46:44,364
- You certainly saved my life-
- You didn't think I planned it?

1047
01:46:44,533 --> 01:46:46,858
The last thing I wanted to do
was knock him over.

1048
01:46:47,035 --> 01:46:50,285
- No, of course-
- Let's stop the chatter for a while.

1049
01:46:53,541 --> 01:46:55,664
- Sorry. The little one got away.
- Never mind.

1050
01:46:55,835 --> 01:46:59,998
Tell Boltchak to stay up here.
Tell him I want to examine the gorilla.

1051
01:47:05,927 --> 01:47:09,628
Fine gorilla. Very fine specimen.

1052
01:47:11,056 --> 01:47:16,810
I'd say he weighed
close up to 700 or 800 pounds.

1053
01:47:17,688 --> 01:47:19,265
I say, Boltchak.

1054
01:47:19,939 --> 01:47:22,513
Do you have any idea
why Vic stalked off like that...

1055
01:47:22,692 --> 01:47:25,313
...going back to camp
with hardly a word?

1056
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:30,691
I'd say he had a very good reason
for hurrying back to camp.

1057
01:47:32,492 --> 01:47:34,284
Here. Have some more.

1058
01:47:35,203 --> 01:47:37,954
I must have said something to upset him.

1059
01:47:38,247 --> 01:47:42,624
If you don't know the reason,
I'd begin to find out if I were you.

1060
01:47:43,878 --> 01:47:45,869
What do you mean by that?

1061
01:47:50,925 --> 01:47:53,380
If I had a wife as pretty as yours...

1062
01:47:54,345 --> 01:47:56,384
...I'd find out fast enough.

1063
01:48:15,947 --> 01:48:18,864
We'll go back to the canoes
the first thing in the morning...

1064
01:48:19,033 --> 01:48:20,693
...get an early start.

1065
01:48:22,119 --> 01:48:23,744
Everything goes.

1066
01:48:45,306 --> 01:48:47,050
Where is everybody?

1067
01:48:48,351 --> 01:48:51,435
- Still up there.
- Did you get the baby gorillas?

1068
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:55,522
Everything fouled up.

1069
01:48:57,776 --> 01:48:59,769
You don't look much like a bridegroom...

1070
01:48:59,945 --> 01:49:03,194
...who cometh forth from his chamber
and rejoiceth at....

1071
01:49:03,364 --> 01:49:04,692
You don't look so hot.

1072
01:49:05,491 --> 01:49:07,116
I don't feel so hot.

1073
01:49:09,203 --> 01:49:11,491
You got left on third, huh, Marzy?

1074
01:49:13,206 --> 01:49:15,080
Didn't even go to bat.

1075
01:49:16,084 --> 01:49:17,662
You couldn't tell him?

1076
01:49:20,504 --> 01:49:21,535
No.

1077
01:49:22,631 --> 01:49:24,838
- You went noble.
- I went yellow.

1078
01:49:25,009 --> 01:49:27,333
You went noble.

1079
01:49:29,345 --> 01:49:32,180
How do you plan to break the news
down the street?

1080
01:49:33,808 --> 01:49:35,433
I'll think of some way.

1081
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:39,346
That's just the way to keep you
clearheaded, of course.

1082
01:49:40,188 --> 01:49:43,640
Sometimes it gets you nasty
enough to get a nasty job done.

1083
01:49:43,817 --> 01:49:47,185
Then don't be so stingy
with your nastiness, partner.

1084
01:49:47,361 --> 01:49:49,401
Come here. Let's have a drink.

1085
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:53,443
Like I've always said, Kelly,
you're all right.

1086
01:49:55,035 --> 01:49:58,201
- Here's to your noble nastiness.
- Skol, Kelly.

1087
01:49:58,371 --> 01:49:59,616
Drink up.

1088
01:50:01,499 --> 01:50:04,286
To the victor belongs the spoiled herring.

1089
01:50:04,668 --> 01:50:08,713
Victor, that's you. Vic. Joke. Laugh.

1090
01:50:12,508 --> 01:50:14,667
Yes, sir. You're all right, Kelly.

1091
01:50:14,886 --> 01:50:17,128
You've said that before, but I love it.

1092
01:50:17,930 --> 01:50:19,673
Don't worry, Vic.

1093
01:50:20,223 --> 01:50:23,343
I'm not trying to crawl back
into green pastures.

1094
01:50:24,519 --> 01:50:26,346
Poor old Marzy.

1095
01:50:27,521 --> 01:50:31,733
Got himself all tangled up
in one of his nets like a gorilla...

1096
01:50:31,901 --> 01:50:34,024
...and he doesn't know how to get out.

1097
01:50:42,869 --> 01:50:46,035
If you two will excuse me,
I think I shall retire.

1098
01:50:48,457 --> 01:50:51,873
No, don't.
There's plenty in the bottle yet...

1099
01:50:52,044 --> 01:50:55,079
...and more where that came from,
plenty for all of us.

1100
01:50:55,964 --> 01:50:58,086
Come on in, Linda. Join the party.

1101
01:50:59,676 --> 01:51:02,000
What are you so surprised about?

1102
01:51:02,302 --> 01:51:06,051
You always guessed Kelly and I
were old friends, didn't you?

1103
01:51:06,223 --> 01:51:08,974
It's all right for old friends
to have a drink, isn't it?

1104
01:51:09,142 --> 01:51:11,549
What are you saying? You're drunk.

1105
01:51:11,727 --> 01:51:15,677
Certainly I'm drunk, but I
certainly know what I'm saying.

1106
01:51:17,233 --> 01:51:19,687
Listen, Mrs. N,
you're not going to tell me...

1107
01:51:19,859 --> 01:51:22,730
...that you've been taking
all this seriously, are you?

1108
01:51:24,739 --> 01:51:28,403
You know how it is on safari.
It's in all the books.

1109
01:51:28,575 --> 01:51:30,734
The woman always falls
for the white hunter.

1110
01:51:30,911 --> 01:51:34,031
And we guys make the most of it.
Do you blame us?

1111
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:37,705
When you come along
with that look in your eye...

1112
01:51:37,875 --> 01:51:40,663
...there isn't a guy
in the whole world who could-

1113
01:51:53,931 --> 01:51:56,054
- What's been going on?
- I'm glad you came in.

1114
01:51:56,225 --> 01:51:59,926
This big Congo Casanova has been after
your wife ever since she's been here.

1115
01:52:00,104 --> 01:52:01,977
She's been sport enough
to hold him off...

1116
01:52:02,147 --> 01:52:04,139
...and not tell you
to not spoil your fun.

1117
01:52:04,316 --> 01:52:08,444
Tonight he got her here on the pretext-
Well, he was pretty drunk.

1118
01:52:08,778 --> 01:52:13,107
So when I came tearing over here to help,
he was getting pretty bad...

1119
01:52:13,282 --> 01:52:15,773
...so she shot him,
as any decent woman would do.

1120
01:52:17,494 --> 01:52:19,533
- We're going, darling.
- Beat it.

1121
01:52:19,704 --> 01:52:21,578
Come on there. Get going.

1122
01:52:23,791 --> 01:52:26,461
If she hadn't I'd have done it myself.

1123
01:52:29,755 --> 01:52:33,124
Are you going to stand there
and bleed to death?

1124
01:52:34,718 --> 01:52:38,300
It's just a piece of skin.
Don't you go losing your head.

1125
01:52:38,471 --> 01:52:41,341
- You've done well up to now.
- Losing my head! Fine thing.

1126
01:52:41,515 --> 01:52:43,342
Stop talking
and put a bandage on this.

1127
01:52:43,517 --> 01:52:45,805
Then stop yelling at me.

1128
01:52:46,353 --> 01:52:49,104
Too bad you didn't teach her
to shoot a little straighter.

1129
01:52:49,272 --> 01:52:51,348
Africa and gorillas. Lions.

1130
01:52:51,858 --> 01:52:56,270
The only lions I ever want to see again
are the two in front of the Public Library.

1131
01:53:03,826 --> 01:53:06,697
- We're ready to shove off now.
- Darling.

1132
01:53:17,005 --> 01:53:20,338
- You can get into the boat now.
- Thank you, Brownie.

1133
01:53:21,425 --> 01:53:23,751
Are you sure you're ready to go?

1134
01:53:25,805 --> 01:53:27,180
Quite sure.

1135
01:53:40,651 --> 01:53:43,818
Now that you're leaving,
how about saying goodbye?

1136
01:53:44,947 --> 01:53:46,903
Okay.
Goodbye.

1137
01:53:50,576 --> 01:53:52,616
I'm going to stay up there for a while...

1138
01:53:52,787 --> 01:53:56,369
...try and pick up a couple of baby
gorillas. Make the trip pay for itself.

1139
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:59,327
- How about you sticking around?
- What for?

1140
01:54:00,669 --> 01:54:03,704
- I thought that maybe....
- No.

1141
01:54:04,547 --> 01:54:08,794
Nobody is gonna wring me out
and hang me up to dry again.

1142
01:54:10,428 --> 01:54:11,885
How about it?

1143
01:54:13,388 --> 01:54:15,546
As soon as I'm through up there...

1144
01:54:15,724 --> 01:54:18,641
...we could head back
and stop by Father Josef's.

1145
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:20,517
Would you like that?

1146
01:54:23,731 --> 01:54:27,182
You mean you're gonna make
an honest woman out of me?

1147
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:31,228
- It suits me, Kelly.
- It suits you?

1148
01:54:31,779 --> 01:54:33,689
Listen, you and your
quick-change acts...

1149
01:54:33,865 --> 01:54:35,656
...aren't hanging blossoms over me...

1150
01:54:35,825 --> 01:54:38,742
...because you feel the cold weather
coming on. No, thanks.

1151
01:54:38,911 --> 01:54:42,077
I'll go back where I can be honest
without getting kicked around.

1152
01:54:42,247 --> 01:54:43,706
I'll see you.

1153
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:10,975
- What?
- Take good care of her!

1154
01:55:13,191 --> 01:55:14,519
