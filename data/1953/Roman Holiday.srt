88
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:32,586
- She's asleep.
- She was in hysterics 3 minutes ago.

89
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:37,591
- Are you asleep, ma'am?

00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:42,607

Highness a moment.

91
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:47,601
l'm very ashamed, Doctor.
Suddenly l was crying.

92
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:51,616
To cry is perfectly normal.

93
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:55,620

00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:04,629
l'll improve trade relations and l'll...

97
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:06,620
There she goes again.
Give her something, please.

98
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:09,623
Uncover her arm, please.

99
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:15,640
- What's that?
- Sleep and calm.

100
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,644
This will relax you
and make you feel a little happy.

101
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:22,636
lt's a new drug, quite harmless.

102
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,641
There.

103
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:30,655

104
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:34,659
You will. lt may take
a little time to take hold.

105
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,650
Just now, lie back.

106
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:41,655
- Can l keep just one light on?
- Of course.

107
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:47,672
The best thing l know is to do
exactly what you wish for a while.

108
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:49,663
Thank you, Doctor.

109
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,668
Oh, the General! Doctor, quick.

110
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:02,687
l'm perfectly all right.

111
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,678
Goodnight, ma'am.

112
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,683

00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:44,028
- Two pairs.
- l've got three shy little sevens.

121
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:49,033
A nervous straight.
Come home, you fools.

122
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:55,029
Look at that, 6,500.
Not bad, that's ten bucks.

123
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,034
One more round and l'm gonna throw
you gents right out in the snow.

124
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:04,048

A date with Her Highness, who'll
graciously pose for some pictures.

126
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:12,056
What do you mean early?
My personal invitation says 1 1.45.

127
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:15,059
Could it be because you're ahead?

128
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,061
- lt could.
- Works out fine for me.

129
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:22,066
This is my last 5,000 and
you hyenas are not gonna get it.

130
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:25,069
Thanks, lrving.

131
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:27,060

00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:31,064
All right, a little seven-card stud.

So happy.

134
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:56,089

Charmed too.

140
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,113
You may sit down.

141
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,128
You'd better sit up, or you'll
get picked up by the police.

142
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:26,130
- Police?
- Yes.

143

2.45...

145
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:38,142
You know, people who can't
handle liquor shouldn't drink it.

146
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:43,147
''lf l were dead and buried
and l heard your voice,''

147
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:49,143
''beneath the sod my heart of dust
would still rejoice.''

148
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:52,145
Do you know that poem?

You're well read, well dressed,

151
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:06,170
snoozing away in a public street.
Would you care to make a statement?

152
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,161
What the world needs

153
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:15,169
is a return to sweetness and decency
in the souls of its young men and...

154
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:25,178
Yeah, l couldn't agree
with you more, but...

155
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:40,193
Get yourself some coffee,
you'll be all right.

156
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:04,217
Look, you take the cab.

157

the cab and go home.

159
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:22,235
- Never carry money.
- That's a bad habit.

160
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:25,238
All right. l'll drop you off, come on.

161
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,243
- lt's a taxi!
- lt's not the Super Chief.

162
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:35,248
Where are we going?

163
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,263

- What?

164
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:42,255
- Colosseum.
- Come on, you're not that drunk.

165
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:47,271
You're so smart, l'm not drunk at all.

166
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:53,267
- l'm just being very happy.
- Hey, don't go to sleep again.

Where are we going?

168
00:21:59,283 --> 00:22:03,276
Where do you want to go?
Where shall l take you?

169
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:07,280
Where do you live?

170
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:11,284
Come on. Where do you live?

171
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:15,288
Come on, where do you live?

172
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:19,292
Colosseum.

173
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:26,310
- She lives in the Colosseum.
- lt's the wrong address.

174
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,312
Look, for me it is very late night.

175
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:34,308
My wife... l have three bambino,
you know bambino?

176
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,323
My taxi go home,
we go home together.

177
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:41,325
Via Margutta 51.

178
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:45,318
Via Margutta 51!

179
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:01,334
Here is Via Margutta 51.
l am very happy.

180
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:05,337
A thousand lire. Mila lire.

181
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:20,353
One, two, three, four mila.

182
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:24,357
- OK.
- For me?

183
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,363
OK. Now, look,
take a little bit of that.

184
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,367
Take her wherever she wants to go.

185
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:40,373
Goodnight.

186
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:46,379
Oh! No, no. Momento.

187
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:52,396
All right. Look, when she wakes up,
she'll tell you where to go.

188
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:56,389
Momento.
My taxi is not for sleep.

189
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,390
You understand?

190
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:02,406
Look, pal, this is not my problem.

191
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:04,397
l never see her before. OK.

192
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:08,412
ls not your problem,
is not my problem.

193
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:14,418
What you want?
You don't want girl, me don't want girl.

194
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:16,409
Police. Maybe she want girl!

195
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:21,414
Stay calm, stay calm. OK.

196
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:04,468
So happy.

197
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:06,459
So happy.

198
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:31,484
l ought to have my head examined.

199
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,490
ls this the elevator?

200
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:40,493
lt's my room!

201
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:47,500
l'm terribly sorry to mention it,
but the dizziness is getting worse.

202
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:53,517
- Can l sleep here?
- That's the general idea.

203
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:58,511
Can l have a silk nightgown
with rosebuds on it?

204
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:03,527
l'm afraid
you'll have to rough it tonight.

205
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:06,530
- ln these.
- Pyjamas.

206
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,523
Sorry, honey, l haven't
worn a nightgown in years.

207
00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:15,528
Will you help me
get undressed, please?

208
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:22,534
OK.

209
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,551
There you are.
You can handle the rest.

210
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:51,564
May l have some?

211
00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:55,579
No!

212
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:59,583
- Now, look!
- This is very unusual.

213
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:04,577
l've never been alone with a man
before, even with my dress on.

214
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:08,581
With my dress off, it's most unusual.

215
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:15,588
l don't seem to mind. Do you?

216
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:22,595
l think l'll go out for a cup of coffee.
You'd better get to sleep.

217
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:25,609
Oh, no. On this one.

218
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:28,612
You're terribly nice.

219
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:30,603
Hey, come here.

220
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:36,620
These are pyjamas, they're
to sleep in. You're to climb into them.

221
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,609
- Understand?
- Thank you.

222
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:43,627
And you sleep on the couch. Not on
the bed, on the couch. ls that clear?

223
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:47,631
- Do you know my favourite poem?
- You've already recited it.

224
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:51,635
''Arethusa arose
From her couch of snows''

225
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:55,639
''ln the Acroceraunian Mountains.''

226
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:57,641
- Keats.
- Shelley.

227
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:00,644
Keep your mind off the poetry
and on the pyjamas.

228
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:02,635
- You'll be fine.
- Keats.

229
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:06,650
Shelley. l'll be back
in about ten minutes.

230
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,641
Keats.

231
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:19,663
You have my permission to withdraw.

232
00:28:19,663 --> 00:28:21,654
Thank you very much.

233
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:31,675
- Well?
- No trace.

234
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:34,678
- Did you search the grounds?
- Attics to cellar.

235
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:37,681
You must swear not to
speak of this to anyone.

236
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:41,685
l must remind you that the princess
is the direct heir to the throne.

237
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:46,690
This must be classified as top
crisis secret. Have l your pledge?

238
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,682
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

239
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:54,687
Now we must notify Their Majesties.

240
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,772
- So happy.
- The pleasure's mine.

241
00:30:23,787 --> 00:30:25,778
Screwball!

242
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:14,827
Holy smoke,
the princess's interview!

243
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,842
Eleven forty-five!

244
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:19,831
Oh, sh!

245
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:05,889
Hi, Joe.

246
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:08,881
- Morning, Joe.
- Hello, honey.

247
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:15,899
Mr Hennessy has been
looking for you.

248
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:17,890
Uh-oh.

249
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:20,892
Thanks a lot, hon.

250
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:24,897
Come in.

251
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:34,918
- Looking for me?
- Just coming to work?

252
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:37,910
- Who, me?
- We start at 8.30 in this office.

253
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:41,925
- We pick up our assignments...
- l got mine last night.

254
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:44,917
- What assignment was that?
- The princess, 1 1.45.

255
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:50,934
You've already been to the interview?

256
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:52,925
Sure, l just got back.

257
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:57,930
- Well, well. All my apologies.
- lt's all right.

258
00:32:58,942 --> 00:32:59,931
- lnteresting.
- No, just routine.

259
00:33:00,944 --> 00:33:02,946
Did she answer
all the questions on the list?

260
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:06,950
Of course. l've got 'em
right here somewhere.

261
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,953
Don't disturb yourself,
l have a copy here.

262
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:14,958
How did Her Highness react to
the idea of a European Federation?

263
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:18,951
- She thought it was just fine.
- She did?

264
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:23,967
- She thought there'd be two effects.
- Two?

265
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:28,972
- The direct and the indirect.
- Remarkable.

266
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:33,966
Naturally, she thought that the indirect
would not be as direct as the direct.

267
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:37,981
- That is, not right away.
- No.

268
00:33:37,981 --> 00:33:40,973
Later on, of course, nobody knows.

269
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:43,976
Well, well.

270
00:33:44,988 --> 00:33:46,990
That was a shrewd observation.

271
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:51,984
They fool you, these royal kids.
They're smarter than we suspect.

272
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:57,990
How did she feel about
the future friendship of nations?

273
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:04,007
Youth. She felt that
the youth of the world

274
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:08,000
must lead the way to a better world.

275
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:11,003
Original.

276
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:15,007
By the way, what was she wearing?

277
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:21,024
- You mean what did she have on?
- That's usually what it means.

278
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:24,027
- ls it too warm for you?
- No, l just hurried over here.

279
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:27,030
Naturally, with a story
of these dimensions.

280
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,034
- Did you say she was wearing grey?
- No, l didn't.

281
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:36,039
- She usually wears grey.
- Well, it was a kind of a grey.

282
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:39,031
l think l know the dress,
it has a gold collar...

283
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:43,046
That's the one. l didn't know
exactly how to describe it.

284
00:34:43,046 --> 00:34:47,050
l think you described it very well,

285
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,054
in view of the fact that
she was taken violently ill at 3 a.m.,

286
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:53,045
put to bed with a high fever,

287
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:58,050
and has had all her appointments
for today cancelled in toto!

288
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:04,056
- ln toto?
- Yes, Mr Bradley, in toto.

289
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:12,075
- That's pretty hard to swallow.
- ln view of the fact you just left her.

290
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:16,079
Here it is, Mr Bradley, all over the
front page of every paper in Rome.

291
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,082
All right, l overslept.
lt can happen to anybody.

292
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:21,073
lf you ever got up
and read a morning paper,

293
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:26,089
you might discover little news events,
little items of general interest,

294
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:30,093
that might stop you getting
immersed in such a gold-plated,

295
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:34,097
triple-decked, star-spangled
lie as you have just told me.

296
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:37,089
lf l were you l'd try some other
business, like mattress testing!

297
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:41,104
- ls this the princess?
- Yes, Mr Bradley.

298
00:35:41,104 --> 00:35:45,108
lt isn't Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour
or Madame Chiang Kai-Shek.

299
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:49,112
Take a good look. You might
interview her again some day.

300
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:51,114
Am l fired?

301
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:56,119
No. When l want to fire you,
you won't have to ask.

302
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,108
You'll know you're fired.

303
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:03,114
The man's mad.

304
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:29,152
Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley.

305
00:36:29,152 --> 00:36:31,154
Now listen carefully.

306
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:35,147
Hurry up to my place and see
if there's somebody there, asleep.

307
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:39,162
Aha. Si, Mr Joe.

308
00:36:39,162 --> 00:36:43,155
l look, you wait.

309
00:37:04,187 --> 00:37:07,179
- Mr Joe?
- Yeah. Tell me.

310
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:14,197
Giovanni, l love you! Now listen.

311
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:16,188
Yes, Mr Joe.

312
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:20,203
A gun? No.

313
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:23,206
Yes, a gun, a knife, anything.

314
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:27,199
But nobody goes in
and nobody goes out.

315
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:30,202
OK.

316
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:45,228
You still here?

317
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:47,219
What would a real interview
with this dame be worth?

318
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:52,235
- Are you referring to Her Highness?
- l'm not referring to Annie Oakley...

319
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:54,237
- How much?
- What do you care?

320
00:37:54,237 --> 00:37:57,229
- You've got no chance...
- lf l did, how much?

321
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:02,245
Just a plain talk on world
conditions might be worth 250.

322
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:05,248
Her views on clothes, a lot more.

323
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:07,250
- Maybe 1,000.
- Dollars?

324
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,254
l'm talking about
her views on everything.

325
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:15,247
The private and secret
longings of a princess.

326
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:19,251
Her innermost thoughts, as revealed
to your own correspondent,

327
00:38:20,263 --> 00:38:26,259
in a private, personal,
exclusive interview.

328
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:36,268
Can't use it, huh?
l didn't think you'd like it.

329
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:40,271
Come here.

330
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:46,289
- Love angle too, l suppose?
- Practically all love angle.

331
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:48,291
With pictures?

332
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,293
Could be. How much?

333
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:54,297
That particular story would be worth
five grand to any news service.

334
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:57,300
But tell me, Mr Bradley,
if you are sober,

335
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,303
how you are going to
obtain this fantastic interview.

336
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:04,307
l'll enter her sick room
disguised as a thermometer.

337
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:08,300
You said five grand?
l want you to shake on that.

338
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:14,317
You realise she's in bed
and leaves for Athens tomorrow?

339
00:39:14,317 --> 00:39:17,320
- Yes.
- l'd like to make a little side bet.

340
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,313
Five hundred says
you don't come up with the story.

341
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:32,324
- What are you looking at that for?
- Just want to see what day it is.

342
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:37,329
- lt's a deal.
- Now l'd like you to shake.

343
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:43,346
You're into me for about $500 now.

344
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:46,349
When you lose this bet,
you'll owe me $1,000.

345
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:49,352
You poor sucker,
l'll practically own you.

346
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:53,356
You practically have for a couple
of years but that's all over.

347
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:58,361
l'm going to win that money and buy
a one-way ticket back to New York.

348
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:00,352
Go on, l love to hear you whine.

349
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:04,367
When l'm back in a real
newsroom, l'll think of you,

350
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:08,371
sitting here with an empty leash
and nobody to twitch for you.

351
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:12,364
So long, pigeon.

352
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:43,406
- Signor Bradley.
- Everything OK, Giovanni?

353
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:47,410
Si Signor Joe.
Nobody come, nobody go.

354
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,403
- Absolutely nobody.
- Swell, thanks a lot.

355
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:59,422
Oh... Giovanni...
How'd you like to make some money?

356
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:01,424
- Money?
- Yeah.

357
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:05,428
That's the stuff. l've got a sure thing.

358
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:09,432
- Double your money back in two days.
- Double my money?

359
00:41:09,432 --> 00:41:12,424
l need a little investment
capital to swing the deal.

360
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:16,428
Now if you'll lend me a little cash...

361
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:24,447
You owe me two months rent

362
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:27,450
and you want me to lend you money?

363
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,442
No.

364
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:34,446
Tomorrow you'll be sorry.

365
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:40,511
Your Highness...?

366
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:45,517
Your Royal Highness...?

367
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:50,521
Yes, what is it?

368
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:34,626
Dear Dr Bannochhoven...

369
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:38,641
Oh, sure, yes, well...

370
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:42,645
You're fine, much better.
ls there anything you want?

371
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:46,638
- So many things.
- Yes? Well, tell the doctor.

372
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,641
Tell the good doctor everything.

373
00:44:50,653 --> 00:44:53,656
l dreamt and l dreamt...

374
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:56,648
Yes? Well, what did you dream?

375
00:44:58,661 --> 00:45:02,665
l dreamt l was asleep in the street,

376
00:45:02,665 --> 00:45:08,671
and a young man came,
he was tall and strong.

377
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:11,663
He was so mean to me.

378
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:14,666
He was?

379
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:23,675
lt was wonderful.

380
00:45:55,718 --> 00:45:57,709
Good morning.

381
00:46:01,724 --> 00:46:06,718
- Where's Dr Bannochhoven?
- l'm afraid l don't know him.

382
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,722
- Wasn't l talking to him just now?
- Afraid not.

383
00:46:13,736 --> 00:46:15,727
Have l had an accident?

384
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:18,730
No.

385
00:46:19,742 --> 00:46:22,734
Quite safe for me to sit up, huh?

386
00:46:23,746 --> 00:46:25,737
Perfectly.

387
00:46:35,758 --> 00:46:36,747
Thank you.

388
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:48,760
Are these yours?

389
00:46:55,778 --> 00:47:00,772
- Did you lose something?
- No.

390
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:07,790
Would you be so kind
as to tell me where l am?

391
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:11,794
This is what is laughingly
known as my apartment.

392
00:47:11,794 --> 00:47:17,790
- Did you bring me here by force?
- No, no. Quite the contrary.

393
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:24,797
- Have l been here all night...alone?
- lf you don't count me, yes.

394
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,802
So l've spent the night here with you?

395
00:47:31,814 --> 00:47:36,819
Well, l don't know that
l'd use those words exactly,

396
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:43,816
but from a certain angle, yes.

397
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:01,844
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

398
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:05,848
- And you are?
- Bradley, Joe Bradley.

399
00:48:05,848 --> 00:48:09,852
- Delighted.
- You don't know how delighted l am.

400
00:48:09,852 --> 00:48:12,844
- You may sit down.
- Thank you very much.

401
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:20,852
What's your name?

402
00:48:23,866 --> 00:48:28,860
- You may call me Anya.
- Well thank you, Anya.

403
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,877
- Coffee?
- What time is it?

404
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:35,878
About one-thirty.

405
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:38,881
One-thirty! l must get dressed and go!

406
00:48:38,881 --> 00:48:41,884
Why the hurry? There's lots of time.

407
00:48:41,884 --> 00:48:45,888
No there isn't, and l've been
enough trouble as it is.

408
00:48:45,888 --> 00:48:49,881
Trouble?
You're not what l'd call trouble.

409
00:48:51,894 --> 00:48:55,887
- l'm not?
- l'll run a bath for you.

410
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:15,907
There you are.

411
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,949
Here we go now.

412
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:05,968
There you are, that does it. All right.

413
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:08,960
Give me a little slack, will you?

414
00:50:10,973 --> 00:50:12,975
lrving! Why don't you answer?

415
00:50:12,975 --> 00:50:15,978
lt's Joe. Can you
get here in five minutes?

416
00:50:15,978 --> 00:50:19,982
No, l can't come now, Joe, l'm busy.

417
00:50:19,982 --> 00:50:21,984
Oh, no.

418
00:50:21,984 --> 00:50:25,988
Joe, l'm up to my ears in work.

419
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:29,992
Get into your next outfit.
What kind of a scoop, Joe?

420
00:50:29,992 --> 00:50:31,994
l can't talk over the phone.

421
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:34,997
This whole thing
might easily blow sky-high.

422
00:50:34,997 --> 00:50:38,000
lt's front-page stuff,
that's all l can say.

423
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,003
lt might be political or
a scandal, l don't know,

424
00:50:41,003 --> 00:50:44,006
but it's a big story.
l need pictures.

425
00:50:44,006 --> 00:50:46,998
But l can't come now, Joe, l'm busy.

426
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:51,002
And l'm meeting Francesca
at Rocca's in half an hour.

427
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:53,064
- Don't understand.
- Don't understand?

428
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:16,087
There you are.

429
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:22,104
l was looking at all the people.
lt must be fun to live in a place like this.

430
00:52:22,104 --> 00:52:26,108
lt has its moments. l can give you
a commentary on each apartment.

431
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:28,099
l must go.

432
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:36,118
- l only waited to say goodbye.
- Goodbye? But we've only just met!

433
00:52:36,118 --> 00:52:38,109
- How about breakfast?
- l haven't time.

434
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:44,126
lt must be a pretty important date
to run off without eating.

435
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:47,129
- lt is.
- l'll go with you.

436
00:52:47,129 --> 00:52:50,121
That's all right, l can find the place.

437
00:52:53,135 --> 00:52:56,127
Thank you for letting me
sleep in your bed.

438
00:52:57,139 --> 00:53:02,144
- That's all right. Think nothing of it.
- lt was very considerate of you.

439
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:05,147
You must've been awfully
uncomfortable on that couch.

440
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:08,139
No, l do it all the time.

441
00:53:12,154 --> 00:53:15,146
- Goodbye, Mr Bradley.
- Goodbye.

442
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:21,163
Go right through there,
and down all the steps.

443
00:53:21,163 --> 00:53:23,154
Thank you.

444
00:53:54,196 --> 00:53:57,199
- Well... Small world!
- Yeah.

445
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:01,203
l almost forgot.
Can you lend me some money?

446
00:54:01,203 --> 00:54:03,205
Oh, yeah.

447
00:54:03,205 --> 00:54:06,197
That's right,
you didn't have any did you?

448
00:54:10,212 --> 00:54:12,214
How much was it you wanted?

449
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:15,206
l don't know. How much have you got?

450
00:54:16,218 --> 00:54:20,222
Suppose we just split this fifty-fifty.
Here's a thousand lire.

451
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:23,214
A thousand!
Can you really spare all that?

452
00:54:24,226 --> 00:54:27,229
- lt's about a dollar and a half.
- Oh.

453
00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:33,235
l'll arrange for it to be sent back to you.
What is your address?

454
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:35,237
Via Margutta 51.

455
00:54:35,237 --> 00:54:38,240
Via Margutta 51.

456
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,229
Joe Bradley.

457
00:54:40,242 --> 00:54:42,233
Goodbye. Thank you.

458
00:54:56,258 --> 00:55:00,262
Double my money, eh?
You tell me how?

459
00:55:00,262 --> 00:55:03,254
- Tomorrow.
- Yes, tomorrow.

460
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:42,424
What a wonderful hair you have.

461
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:44,415
- Just cut, thank you.
- Just cut?

462
00:57:45,427 --> 00:57:50,432
- Well, then... Cut so?
- Higher.

463
00:57:50,432 --> 00:57:53,424
- Higher? Here?
- More.

464
00:57:56,438 --> 00:57:58,429
- Here!
- Even more.

465
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:01,432
Where?

466
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:05,436
- There.
- There.

467
00:58:06,448 --> 00:58:10,441
- Are you sure, Miss?
- l'm quite sure, thank you.

468
00:58:14,456 --> 00:58:16,447
- All off?
- All off.

469
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,449
Off!

470
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:31,462
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

471
00:58:32,474 --> 00:58:34,465
Yes!

472
00:58:37,479 --> 00:58:38,468
Off!

473
00:58:43,485 --> 00:58:45,476
Off!

474
00:58:50,492 --> 00:58:51,481
Off!

475
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,495
Oh no, no.

476
00:59:05,507 --> 00:59:07,498
Off!

477
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:30,521
That's a nice camera
you have there. Nice...

478
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:34,525
You don't mind if l borrow it?

479
00:59:35,537 --> 00:59:37,539
- Miss Webber.
- Just for two minutes.

480
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:38,528
No.

481
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:42,533
Go, it's my camera.

482
00:59:50,552 --> 00:59:53,555
You musician, maybe?

483
00:59:53,555 --> 00:59:56,558
You artist, huh?

484
00:59:56,558 --> 00:59:58,549
Painter?

485
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:03,794
l know. You model.

486
01:00:03,794 --> 01:00:05,785
- Model, huh?
- Thank you.

487
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:09,800
lt's perfect.

488
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:15,806
You're nice without long hair.
Now it's cool, huh? Cool.

489
01:00:15,806 --> 01:00:17,797
lt's just what l wanted.

490
01:00:18,809 --> 01:00:22,813
Now, why don't you
come dancing tonight with me?

491
01:00:22,813 --> 01:00:24,804
You should see, it's so nice.

492
01:00:25,816 --> 01:00:29,820
lt's on a boat, on the Tiber,
the river, by Sant'Angelo.

493
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:34,825
Moonlight, music, romantic.
lt's very, very...

494
01:00:34,825 --> 01:00:38,818
- Please, you come?
- l wish l could.

495
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:46,837
But your friends,
l don't think they'll recognise you.

496
01:00:46,837 --> 01:00:48,828
No, l don't think they will.

497
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,831
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

498
01:00:54,845 --> 01:00:59,839
After nine l'll be there, dancing on
the river. Remember Sant'Angelo.

499
01:01:00,851 --> 01:01:05,845
All my friends... lf you come,
you will be most pretty of all girls.

500
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,862
Thank you.

501
01:01:11,862 --> 01:01:12,851

Thank you.

503

A thousand lire.

505
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:50,950

508
01:03:36,006 --> 01:03:40,010
- Well, it's you!
- Yes, Mr Bradley.

509
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:43,002
Or is it?

510
01:03:44,014 --> 01:03:47,006
- Do you like it?
- Very much.

511
01:03:51,021 --> 01:03:53,012
So that was your
mysterious appointment.

512
01:03:54,024 --> 01:03:57,027
- l have a confession to make.
- A confession?

513
01:03:57,027 --> 01:04:02,032
Yes, l ran away
last night...from school.

514
01:04:02,032 --> 01:04:04,034
Why?

515
01:04:04,034 --> 01:04:07,037
- Trouble with the teacher?
- No, nothing like that.

516
01:04:07,037 --> 01:04:10,040
You wouldn't run away for nothing.

517
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,042
lt was only meant to be
for a few hours.

518
01:04:12,042 --> 01:04:16,046
They gave me something
last night to make me sleep.

519
01:04:16,046 --> 01:04:18,037
Oh, l see.

520
01:04:21,051 --> 01:04:25,044
- l'd better get a taxi and go back.
- Look, before you do,

521
01:04:26,056 --> 01:04:29,048
why not take a little time for yourself?

522
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:31,061
Maybe another hour.

523
01:04:31,061 --> 01:04:35,065
Live dangerously, take the whole day.

524
01:04:35,065 --> 01:04:37,056
l could do some things
l've always wanted to.

525
01:04:38,068 --> 01:04:39,069
Like what?

526
01:04:39,069 --> 01:04:44,074
You can't imagine. l'd like to do
whatever l liked, the whole day long.

527
01:04:44,074 --> 01:04:47,077
Like having your hair cut
and eating gelati?

528
01:04:47,077 --> 01:04:50,069
Yes, and l'd like to
sit at a sidewalk caf챕,

529
01:04:51,081 --> 01:04:54,084
look in shop windows,
walk in the rain.

530
01:04:54,084 --> 01:04:57,076
Have fun, and maybe
some excitement.

531
01:04:58,088 --> 01:05:01,091
lt doesn't seem much to you,
does it?

532
01:05:01,091 --> 01:05:03,093
lt's great.

533
01:05:03,093 --> 01:05:08,098
Tell you what. Why don't we
do all those things...together?

534
01:05:08,098 --> 01:05:12,102
- Don't you have to work?
- No. Today will be a holiday.

535
01:05:12,102 --> 01:05:15,105
You don't want to do
a lot of silly things.

536
01:05:15,105 --> 01:05:18,097
Don't l? First wish, one sidewalk caf챕.

537
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:21,100
Coming right up.
l know just the place.

538
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:34,124
What will they say in school
about your hair?

539
01:05:34,124 --> 01:05:37,127
They'll have a fit.

540
01:05:37,127 --> 01:05:40,119
What would they say if they knew
l'd slept in your room?

541
01:05:41,131 --> 01:05:45,135
Tell you what, you don't tell your folks
and l won't tell mine.

542
01:05:45,135 --> 01:05:46,136
lt's a pact.

543
01:05:46,136 --> 01:05:52,132
- Now, what would you like to drink?
- Champagne, please.

544
01:05:55,145 --> 01:05:58,148
Champagne?

545
01:05:58,148 --> 01:06:04,144
Well, champagne,
and cold coffee for me.

546
01:06:06,156 --> 01:06:09,148
Must be quite a school,
champagne for lunch.

547
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,151
- Only on special occasions.
- For instance?

548
01:06:13,163 --> 01:06:15,165
The last time
was my father's anniversary.

549
01:06:15,165 --> 01:06:17,167
- Wedding?
- No.

550
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:22,172
The fortieth anniversary
of...the day he got his job.

551
01:06:22,172 --> 01:06:26,176
Forty years on the job.
What do you know about that?

552
01:06:26,176 --> 01:06:29,179
What does he do?

553
01:06:29,179 --> 01:06:33,183
Well, mostly you might
call it public relations.

554
01:06:33,183 --> 01:06:35,185
Oh, well that's hard work.

555
01:06:35,185 --> 01:06:37,176
- l wouldn't care for it.
- Does he?

556
01:06:38,188 --> 01:06:40,190
l've heard him complain about it.

557
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:42,181
Why doesn't he quit?

558
01:06:43,193 --> 01:06:46,196
People in that line of work
almost never do quit,

559
01:06:46,196 --> 01:06:49,199
unless it's actually unhealthy
for them to continue.

560
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:52,191
Well, here's to his health then.

561
01:06:53,203 --> 01:06:56,195
You know, that's what
everybody says.

562
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:03,202
- lt's all right?
- Yes, thank you.

563
01:07:04,214 --> 01:07:06,216
What is your work?

564
01:07:06,216 --> 01:07:09,208
Oh, l'm in the selling game.

565
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,221
Really? How interesting.

566
01:07:11,221 --> 01:07:13,212
What do you sell?

567
01:07:16,226 --> 01:07:21,220
Fertiliser. Chemicals, stuff like that.

568
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:33,232
- lrving! Am l glad to see you!
- Why, did you forget your wallet?

569
01:07:34,244 --> 01:07:36,235
- Sit down.
- Aren't you going to introduce me?

570
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:41,251
Yes. This is a very good friend of
mine, lrving Radovich. Anya, lrving.

571
01:07:41,251 --> 01:07:43,253
- Anya...?
- Smith.

572
01:07:43,253 --> 01:07:47,246
- Oh. Hiya, Smitty.
- Charmed.

573
01:07:49,259 --> 01:07:54,253
Hey, did anybody ever tell you
you're a dead ringer for...

574
01:07:59,269 --> 01:08:06,266
- Well, l guess l'll be going.
- No, don't do that, join us.

575
01:08:09,279 --> 01:08:12,271
Well, just till Francesca gets here.

576
01:08:13,283 --> 01:08:17,287
Tell me Mr Radovich,
what is a ringer?

577
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:20,290
- Oh, waiter!
- lt's an American term.

578
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:25,295
lt means anyone who has
a great deal of charm.

579
01:08:25,295 --> 01:08:28,298
Oh, thank you.

580
01:08:28,298 --> 01:08:30,289
You're welcome.

581
01:08:34,304 --> 01:08:35,293
Cousins.

582
01:08:36,306 --> 01:08:39,298
Mr Bradley's just been telling me
all about his work.

583
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,301
- l'd like to have heard that.
- What do you do?

584
01:08:43,313 --> 01:08:46,316
l'm in the same racket as Joe,
only l'm a...

585
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:49,319
l'm awfully sorry, lrving.

586
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:52,322
- What are you...?
- l'm sorry.

587
01:08:52,322 --> 01:08:55,314
l can take a hint. l'll see you around.

588
01:08:56,326 --> 01:09:00,319
- But your drink's just here.
- Yeah, lrving, take it easy.

589
01:09:01,331 --> 01:09:05,335
l'm sorry about that.
Sit down, that's a good fellow.

590
01:09:05,335 --> 01:09:07,326
That's the boy.

591
01:09:08,338 --> 01:09:12,342
You're... You're twisting
my arm, you know.

592
01:09:12,342 --> 01:09:15,345
Just be a little more careful not to spill.

593
01:09:15,345 --> 01:09:18,348
- Spill? Who's been spilling?
- You.

594
01:09:18,348 --> 01:09:20,339
- Me?
- Yeah.

595
01:09:22,352 --> 01:09:24,343
Where did you find this loony?

596
01:09:27,357 --> 01:09:32,362
You're OK. Here's to you, huh?
Here's hoping for the best.

597
01:09:32,362 --> 01:09:37,356
lf it wasn't for that hair,
l'd swear that you...

598
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:42,361
Thanks.

599
01:09:43,373 --> 01:09:45,375
You slipped, you almost hurt yourself.

600
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:48,367
- l slipped?
- Yes, you did.

601
01:09:49,379 --> 01:09:51,381
- l didn't slip.
- A bad sprain...

602
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:55,385
- Never mind!
- You'd better get it fixed up.

603
01:09:55,385 --> 01:09:59,389
- Would you excuse us?
- Of course, l'm so sorry.

604
01:09:59,389 --> 01:10:03,382
Joe, what are you trying to do?
Take your hands off me.

605
01:10:04,394 --> 01:10:05,395
- Got your lighter?
- What?

606
01:10:05,395 --> 01:10:07,386
- Have you?
- Yeah.

607
01:10:08,398 --> 01:10:12,402
Listen, what would you do
for five grand?

608
01:10:12,402 --> 01:10:14,404
- Five grand?
- Look...

609
01:10:14,404 --> 01:10:19,398
She doesn't know who l am.
This is my story, l gotta protect it.

610
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:22,412
She's really the...

611
01:10:22,412 --> 01:10:25,415
Your pictures
will make this twice as valuable.

612
01:10:25,415 --> 01:10:28,418
- The princess goes slumming.
- You're in for 25째%.

613
01:10:28,418 --> 01:10:32,422
- Of 5,000?
- Minimum, Hennessy shook on it.

614
01:10:32,422 --> 01:10:35,425
- That's $1,500!
- lt's $1,250.

615
01:10:35,425 --> 01:10:39,429
- Now you shake.
- OK, now lend me 30,000.

616
01:10:39,429 --> 01:10:42,432
That's $50! Are you gonna buy
the crown jewels?

617
01:10:42,432 --> 01:10:46,436
She's drinking champagne.
We gotta entertain her.

618
01:10:46,436 --> 01:10:49,439
We can't go running around
with a hot princess!

619
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:53,432
Do you want in
on this deal or don't you?

620
01:10:59,449 --> 01:11:04,454
- This l want back Saturday.
- OK. Now where's your lighter?

621
01:11:04,454 --> 01:11:05,443
Let's go to work.

622
01:11:13,463 --> 01:11:15,454
- Better now?
- Huh?

623
01:11:16,466 --> 01:11:18,468
- Your ear.
- My ear?

624
01:11:18,468 --> 01:11:22,472
Oh, yeah, Joe fixed it.

625
01:11:22,472 --> 01:11:25,464
- Would you like a cigarette?
- Yes, please.

626
01:11:26,476 --> 01:11:28,467
You won't believe it,
but it's my very first.

627
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:31,481
Your very first?

628
01:11:31,481 --> 01:11:36,475
- No smoking in school?
- Your first cigarette.

629
01:11:42,492 --> 01:11:44,483
There, the gismo works.

630
01:11:46,496 --> 01:11:49,499
Well, what's the verdict, OK?

631
01:11:49,499 --> 01:11:52,491
- Nothing to it.
- That's right, nothing to it.

632
01:11:56,506 --> 01:11:58,508
l'll stretch my legs a little.

633
01:11:58,508 --> 01:12:03,502
- l'll pick this one up, lrving.
- You can afford it.

634
01:12:04,514 --> 01:12:08,518
What next?
Shall we make a little schedule?

635
01:12:08,518 --> 01:12:11,521
Oh, not that word, please.

636
01:12:11,521 --> 01:12:15,525
l didn't mean a work schedule...
a school schedule,

637
01:12:15,525 --> 01:12:19,518
- l meant a fun schedule.
- Let's just go, huh?

638
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:23,533
How about you, lrving, are you ready?

639
01:12:23,533 --> 01:12:26,525
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

640
01:12:28,538 --> 01:12:32,542
Francesca. Oh, this is...

641
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:35,545
- Smitty.
- She's a grand girl, lrving.

642
01:12:35,545 --> 01:12:37,536
Five grand.

643
01:12:38,548 --> 01:12:41,551
- Joe.
- Where are you going now?

644
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:44,543
Honey, l gotta work.
l'll call you tonight.

645
01:13:24,594 --> 01:13:29,599
Look at those men! They were
supposed to be inconspicuous.

646
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,590
You asked for plain clothes.

647
01:15:21,711 --> 01:15:23,702
Hey, stop, come back.

648
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:23,833
l'm going straight from now on.

649
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:25,835
News Service? What did he mean?

650
01:17:25,835 --> 01:17:31,841
Oh, you say you're with the press
and you can get away with anything.

651
01:17:31,841 --> 01:17:36,835
Going to church to get married
on a scooter! Joe's a wonderful liar.

652
01:17:44,854 --> 01:17:47,846
Congratulations!

653
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:02,861
Don't look so worried,
l won't hold you to it.

654
01:18:03,873 --> 01:18:04,862
Thank you very much.

655
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:07,877
Don't be too grateful.

656
01:18:07,877 --> 01:18:09,868
OK, l won't.

657
01:18:11,881 --> 01:18:14,884
l'm a good liar too, aren't l?

658
01:18:14,884 --> 01:18:18,888
- The best l ever met.
- Thank you very much.

659
01:18:18,888 --> 01:18:22,881
Say... Come with me.

660
01:18:29,899 --> 01:18:30,900
The Mouth of Truth.

661
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,904
The legend is, if you're a liar
and you put your hand in there,

662
01:18:34,904 --> 01:18:36,906
it'll be bitten off.

663
01:18:36,906 --> 01:18:42,902
- What a horrid idea.
- Let's see you do it.

664
01:19:06,936 --> 01:19:08,927
Let's see you do it.

665
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:12,931
Sure.

666
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,962
Hello!

667
01:19:32,962 --> 01:19:38,968
- You beast, you're all right!
- l'm sorry. lt was just a joke.

668
01:19:38,968 --> 01:19:42,972
- You never hurt your hand.
- l'm sorry.

669
01:19:42,972 --> 01:19:44,974
- OK?
- Yes.

670
01:19:44,974 --> 01:19:46,965
All right, let's go. Look out!

671
01:19:56,986 --> 01:19:58,977
l'll park at the corner.

672
01:20:20,009 --> 01:20:24,013
What do they mean,
all these inscriptions?

673
01:20:24,013 --> 01:20:27,016
Each one represents a wish fulfilled.

674
01:20:27,016 --> 01:20:30,019
lt started during the war, in an air raid.

675
01:20:30,019 --> 01:20:34,023
A man with his four children
was caught in the street.

676
01:20:34,023 --> 01:20:38,027
He ran to that wall for shelter
and prayed.

677
01:20:38,027 --> 01:20:41,030
Bombs fell very close
but no one was hurt.

678
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:45,023
Later, he came back
and put up the first tablet.

679
01:20:46,035 --> 01:20:48,037
Now it's a sort of shrine.

680
01:20:48,037 --> 01:20:49,038
People come,

681
01:20:49,038 --> 01:20:54,032
and when their wishes are granted,
they put up another plaque.

682
01:20:55,044 --> 01:20:56,033
Lovely story.

683
01:21:00,049 --> 01:21:02,040
Read some of the inscriptions.

684
01:21:16,065 --> 01:21:20,058
Make a wish? Tell the doctor?

685
01:21:22,071 --> 01:21:26,064
Anyway, the chances of it
being granted are very slight.

686
01:21:28,077 --> 01:21:29,066
Well, what now?

687
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:34,083
- l've heard you can dance on a boat.
- You mean Sant'Angelo.

688
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:36,085
- Couldn't we go tonight?
- Why not?

689
01:21:36,085 --> 01:21:38,087
Anything you wish.

690
01:21:38,087 --> 01:21:44,093
At midnight l'll turn into a pumpkin
and drive away in my glass slipper.

691
01:21:44,093 --> 01:21:46,084
That'll be the end of the fairytale.

692
01:21:47,096 --> 01:21:50,088
- l guess lrving has to go now.
- l do?

693
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:55,104
Yes, you know, that big business
development you have to attend to?

694
01:21:55,104 --> 01:21:58,107
- That development.
- Can't afford not to.

695
01:21:58,107 --> 01:22:01,110
Yeah. See you later, Smitty.

696
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:05,103
- Good luck with the big development.
- Thanks.

697
01:23:45,214 --> 01:23:46,203
Hello.

698
01:23:47,216 --> 01:23:49,207
Hello.

699
01:24:04,233 --> 01:24:09,238
Mr Bradley, if you don't mind my
saying so, l think you're a ringer.

700
01:24:09,238 --> 01:24:13,242
A what? Oh, thanks very much.

701
01:24:13,242 --> 01:24:19,248
You've spent the whole day doing
things l've always wanted to. Why?

702
01:24:19,248 --> 01:24:21,250
lt seemed the thing to do.

703
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:25,243
l've never heard of anybody so kind.

704
01:24:26,255 --> 01:24:28,257
lt wasn't any trouble.

705
01:24:28,257 --> 01:24:31,249
Or so completely unselfish.

706
01:24:36,265 --> 01:24:38,256
Let's have a drink at the bar.

707
01:24:44,273 --> 01:24:46,264
There you are.

708
01:24:47,276 --> 01:24:52,281
l look for you a long time.
l think maybe you not come.

709
01:24:52,281 --> 01:24:57,286
- Off, all off!
- lt's nice without, isn't it? Cool.

710
01:24:57,286 --> 01:25:01,290
- Oh, very good.
- This is Mr Bradley.

711
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:03,292
l Mario Delani.

712
01:25:03,292 --> 01:25:06,295
- Old friends?
- Yes, he cut my hair.

713
01:25:06,295 --> 01:25:08,286
He invited me here tonight.

714
01:25:09,298 --> 01:25:13,302
- What was your name?
- Mario Delani.

715
01:25:13,302 --> 01:25:17,306
Mario Delani.
l'm very glad to know you.

716
01:25:17,306 --> 01:25:19,297
Me too.

717
01:25:20,309 --> 01:25:24,313
Oh, may l enjoy myself the pleasure?

718
01:25:24,313 --> 01:25:27,316
- You mind?
- Go right ahead.

719
01:25:27,316 --> 01:25:28,305
l thank you.

720
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:55,344
- Did l miss anything?
- You're just in time.

721
01:25:55,344 --> 01:25:58,336
- Who's Smitty dancing with?
- Her barber.

722
01:25:59,348 --> 01:26:02,351
He cut her hair this afternoon,
made a date for tonight.

723
01:26:02,351 --> 01:26:03,340
The princess and the barber?

724
01:27:14,423 --> 01:27:17,415
- What is it?
- Momento.

725
01:27:45,454 --> 01:27:47,445
August!

726
01:27:55,464 --> 01:27:56,453
Thank you.

727
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:02,459
Bye.

728
01:28:14,483 --> 01:28:16,474
Your Highness.

729
01:28:18,487 --> 01:28:22,491
Dance quietly towards the entrance.
A car is waiting.

730
01:28:22,491 --> 01:28:24,493
- No.
- Your Highness!

731
01:28:24,493 --> 01:28:28,497
You've made a mistake. Let me go!

732
01:28:28,497 --> 01:28:33,491
Will you let me go? Mr Bradley!
Let me go, will you! Mr Bradley!

733
01:29:49,578 --> 01:29:51,569
Hit him again, Smitty!

734
01:30:00,589 --> 01:30:03,592
- Here are my car keys.
- Police!

735
01:30:03,592 --> 01:30:05,583
The other side of the bridge.

736
01:31:16,665 --> 01:31:19,668
- All right?
- Fine, you?

737
01:31:19,668 --> 01:31:21,659
Oh, fine.

738
01:31:26,675 --> 01:31:28,677
You were great back there.

739
01:31:28,677 --> 01:31:30,668
You weren't so bad yourself.

740
01:31:57,706 --> 01:31:58,695
l...

741
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:03,701
l guess we'd better get out of here.

742
01:32:24,733 --> 01:32:25,734
This is the American Hour,

743
01:32:25,734 --> 01:32:29,727
continuing our programme
of musical selections.

744
01:32:54,763 --> 01:32:58,756
- Everything ruined?
- No. They'll be dry in a minute.

745
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:05,763
Suits you. You should
always wear my clothes.

746
01:33:06,775 --> 01:33:08,766
Seems l do.

747
01:33:12,781 --> 01:33:16,774
l thought a little wine might be good.

748
01:33:17,786 --> 01:33:20,789
- Shall l cook something?
- No kitchen.

749
01:33:20,789 --> 01:33:24,793
- l always eat out.
- Do you like that?

750
01:33:24,793 --> 01:33:27,785
Well, life isn't always what one likes.

751
01:33:28,797 --> 01:33:33,791
- ls it?
- No, it isn't.

752
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:43,801
- Tired?
- A little.

753
01:33:44,813 --> 01:33:46,804
- You've had quite a day.
- A wonderful day.

754
01:33:47,816 --> 01:33:52,821
This is the American Hour
with a special news bulletin.

755
01:33:52,821 --> 01:33:55,824
There is no further word
from the bedside of Princess Ann,

756
01:33:55,824 --> 01:34:00,829
who was taken ill yesterday
on the last leg of her European tour.

757
01:34:00,829 --> 01:34:03,832
Rumours suggest
her condition may be serious,

758
01:34:03,832 --> 01:34:07,825
causing alarm and anxiety
among the people in her country.

759
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,842
- The news can wait.
- Yes.

760
01:34:13,842 --> 01:34:17,835
May l have a little more wine?

761
01:34:19,848 --> 01:34:22,840
l'm sorry l couldn't
cook us some dinner.

762
01:34:23,852 --> 01:34:25,854
Did you learn how in school?

763
01:34:25,854 --> 01:34:28,857
l'm a good cook.
l could earn my living at it.

764
01:34:28,857 --> 01:34:31,860
l can sew too, clean a house, iron.

765
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:34,863
l learned to do all those things,

766
01:34:34,863 --> 01:34:38,856
l just haven't had the chance
to do it for anyone.

767
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:48,867
Well, looks like l'll have to move
and get a place with a kitchen.

768
01:34:53,882 --> 01:34:54,871
Yes.

769
01:35:20,909 --> 01:35:23,901
l shall have to go now.

770
01:35:38,927 --> 01:35:40,918
Anya...

771
01:35:42,931 --> 01:35:45,923
...there's something l want to tell you.

772
01:35:50,939 --> 01:35:52,941
No, please.

773
01:35:52,941 --> 01:35:54,932
Nothing.

774
01:36:07,956 --> 01:36:10,948
l must go and get dressed.

775
01:36:50,999 --> 01:36:53,001
Stop at the next corner, please.

776
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:54,992
OK.

777
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:15,012
- Here?
- Yes.

778
01:37:24,032 --> 01:37:26,023
l have to leave you now.

779
01:37:33,041 --> 01:37:39,047
l'm going to that
corner there and turning.

780
01:37:39,047 --> 01:37:42,039
You stay in the car and drive away.

781
01:37:43,051 --> 01:37:46,043
Promise not to watch me
go beyond the corner.

782
01:37:47,055 --> 01:37:51,048
Just drive away and leave me.

783
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:54,051
As l leave you.

784
01:38:01,069 --> 01:38:02,058
All right.

785
01:38:05,073 --> 01:38:08,065
l don't know how to say goodbye.

786
01:38:10,078 --> 01:38:13,070
l can't think of any words.

787
01:38:15,083 --> 01:38:18,075
Don't try.

788
01:40:10,198 --> 01:40:12,200
Your Royal Highness,

789
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:17,194
twenty-four hours,
they can't all be blank.

790
01:40:19,207 --> 01:40:21,198
They are not.

791
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:25,213
What explanation am l
to offer Their Majesties?

792
01:40:25,213 --> 01:40:28,205
l was indisposed. l am better.

793
01:40:31,219 --> 01:40:36,224
Ma'am, you must appreciate
that l have my duty to perform,

794
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:39,227
just as Your Royal
Highness has her duty.

795
01:40:39,227 --> 01:40:41,229
Your Excellency,

796
01:40:41,229 --> 01:40:45,222
l trust you will not find it necessary
to use that word again.

797
01:40:46,234 --> 01:40:51,239
Were l not completely aware of
my duty to my family and my country,

798
01:40:51,239 --> 01:40:54,231
l would not have come back tonight.

799
01:41:00,248 --> 01:41:02,239
Or indeed, ever again.

800
01:41:09,257 --> 01:41:16,254
And now, since l understand
we have a very full schedule today,

801
01:41:17,265 --> 01:41:20,257
you have my permission to withdraw.

802
01:41:36,284 --> 01:41:39,276
No milk and crackers.

803
01:41:45,293 --> 01:41:49,286
That will be all thank you, Countess.

804
01:42:49,357 --> 01:42:52,360
- Did you really get it?
- What?

805
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:55,352
The princess exclusive.
Did you get it?

806
01:42:56,364 --> 01:42:58,355
- No, l didn't.
- What? That's impossible.

807
01:42:59,367 --> 01:43:01,369
- Coffee?
- Don't hold out on me.

808
01:43:01,369 --> 01:43:05,373
- Who's holding out?
- You are. l know too much.

809
01:43:05,373 --> 01:43:09,366
First you ask about an exclusive
on the princess, next you disappear.

810
01:43:10,378 --> 01:43:14,382
Then l hear a rumour from the
embassy that she's out on the town.

811
01:43:14,382 --> 01:43:18,386
Do you believe every rumour
that comes your way?

812
01:43:18,386 --> 01:43:23,391
There's a lot of other rumours.
About a shindig down by the river,

813
01:43:23,391 --> 01:43:27,395
and the arrest of eight secret
service men from a certain country.

814
01:43:27,395 --> 01:43:32,400
Then she makes
a miraculous recovery. lt all adds up.

815
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:39,407
Don't think you'll raise the price,
a deal's a deal. Now come on.

816
01:43:39,407 --> 01:43:43,400
- Where is that story?
- l have no story.

817
01:43:45,413 --> 01:43:49,417
- Now what was the idea...
- Joe.

818
01:43:49,417 --> 01:43:52,420
- Wait till you see these.
- lrving.

819
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:54,422
Hi, Mr Hennessy.

820
01:43:54,422 --> 01:43:55,411
lrving!

821
01:43:58,426 --> 01:44:01,418
- What's the idea?
- You charge in, spilling things!

822
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:04,421
- Me?
- l warned you before.

823
01:44:05,433 --> 01:44:08,436
- Remember?
- Look at my pants.

824
01:44:08,436 --> 01:44:11,428
- Come and dry them off.
- Nuts to that.

825
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,431
- Did you tell him about Smitty?
- Who?

826
01:44:15,443 --> 01:44:17,445
- Wait till you...
- lrving!

827
01:44:17,445 --> 01:44:20,437
There you go again, lrving.

828
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:25,442
- Joe...
- Save that till later.

829
01:44:26,454 --> 01:44:30,458
- Why don't you go home and shave?
- Shave?

830
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:34,462
Or else keep quiet
till we're finished talking.

831
01:44:34,462 --> 01:44:37,465
What kind of routine is that?

832
01:44:37,465 --> 01:44:39,467
What are you up to? Who's Smitty?

833
01:44:39,467 --> 01:44:42,470
- A guy we met.
- What is there to look at?

834
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:46,474
Just some of lrving's dames.
You wouldn't like them.

835
01:44:46,474 --> 01:44:50,478
- Maybe you would.
- Don't change the subject.

836
01:44:50,478 --> 01:44:53,481
- Yesterday you said...
- l had a good lead.

837
01:44:53,481 --> 01:44:59,477
But l was wrong, that's all
there is to it. There is no story.

838
01:45:00,488 --> 01:45:02,490
OK.

839
01:45:02,490 --> 01:45:08,486
She's holding the press interview
today. Maybe you can get that story.

840
01:45:10,498 --> 01:45:12,500
And you owe me $500.

841
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:17,494
- Take it from my salary, $50 a week.
- Don't think l won't.

842
01:45:19,507 --> 01:45:22,510
What gives?
Have we had a better offer?

843
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:24,512
lrving...

844
01:45:24,512 --> 01:45:28,516
l don't know just how
to tell you this, but...

845
01:45:28,516 --> 01:45:30,507
Wait till l sit down.

846
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:39,527
Well, in regard to the story
that goes with these,

847
01:45:39,527 --> 01:45:41,518
there is no story.

848
01:45:43,531 --> 01:45:45,533
Why not?

849
01:45:45,533 --> 01:45:49,526
l mean, not as far as l'm concerned.

850
01:46:00,548 --> 01:46:06,544
The pictures came out pretty well.
Want to have a look at them?

851
01:46:16,564 --> 01:46:20,557
How about a blow-up
from a negative that size?

857
01:46:40,588 --> 01:46:41,577
Joe, that's good.

858
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:45,582
Lead off with that,
then follow up with the wishes?

859
01:46:46,594 --> 01:46:50,598
l got that from the file.
''Princess lnspects Police.''

860
01:46:50,598 --> 01:46:51,587
Yeah...

861
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:55,603

''Crowned Head?'' Huh?

868
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:15,612
Oh, l get it. Joe, you got...

869
01:47:22,630 --> 01:47:24,632
She's fair game, Joe.

870
01:47:24,632 --> 01:47:27,624

on princesses.

871
01:47:29,637 --> 01:47:33,641

- l know, but...

872
01:47:33,641 --> 01:47:38,635

01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:54,651
Yeah. lt's an assignment, isn't it?

01:47:55,663 --> 01:47:57,654
Yeah.

Ladies and gentlemen,

01:49:04,732 --> 01:49:06,723
Her Royal Highness.

881

Does Your Highness believe

890
01:50:36,824 --> 01:50:41,818
that federation could be a solution
to Europe's economic problems?

l am in favour of any measure

892
01:50:45,833 --> 01:50:49,826
which would lead
to closer cooperation in Europe.

893
01:50:51,839 --> 01:50:53,841
And what, in the opinion
of Your Highness,

894
01:50:53,841 --> 01:50:57,834
is the outlook for
friendship among nations?

895

Each in its own way
was unforgettable.

902
01:51:55,903 --> 01:51:57,894
lt would be difficult to...

903
01:51:59,907 --> 01:52:05,903
