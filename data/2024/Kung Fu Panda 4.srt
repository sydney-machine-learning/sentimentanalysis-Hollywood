1
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:29,483
Hey. Hey.

2
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:33,570
Hey. Hey.

3
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,407
Hey. Hey.

4
00:01:57,052 --> 00:01:58,220
Hmm?

5
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:04,661
That's right. It is I, Tai Lung.

6
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:05,978
It can't be.

7
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:08,122
Tai Lung.

8
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:10,875
I have returned to
take what is mine.

9
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,194
Which is everything
that is yours.

10
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:27,642
Let it be known from the highest mountain
to the lowest valley that Tai Lung lives,

11
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,812
and no one will
stand in his way.

12
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:34,840
Not even the great
Dragon Warrior.

13
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,785
Oh, where is Po?

14
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:48,538
He was supposed to
be here hours ago.

15
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:51,541
Ping, will you
please just relax?

16
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:53,501
I am relaxed!

17
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:56,212
Okay. I'm sure Po is fine.

18
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:58,798
But what if he's sick?
What if he's hurt?

19
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:00,425
What if he's hungry?

20
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,176
Don't get your
noodles in a twist.

21
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,747
If I know our son, he's probably just
kicking back and catching some rays.

22
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,254
Kung fu!

23
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:17,549
Whoa! That's bad.

24
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,427
Whoa! Getting worse.

25
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:22,822
Whoa!

26
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:25,682
Ah, come on!

27
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:44,868
Ha-ha!

28
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:52,584
Okay, big guy. We're really
gonna have to wrap this up.

29
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,682
Whee!

30
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,160
- Oink.
- Oink.

31
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,245
Again, again!

32
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:12,163
- That was fun.
- Let's do that again.

33
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:17,024
And next time, keep your
surf off their turf.

34
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:25,033
I'm late. I'm late.
Ooh, I'm late.

35
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:28,429
The Dragon Warrior is back!
- It's the Dragon Warrior!

36
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:31,057
Was, is and always will be.

37
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:32,934
We love you, Dragon Warrior!

38
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,561
And I love you too, adoring fan.

39
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,145
Sign my scroll. Sign my hat.

40
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:37,313
Sign my shirt. Okay, okay.

41
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:38,755
I'll sign whatever you want.

42
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,632
Po!

43
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:42,735
Master Shifu!

44
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,386
Here, let me just...

45
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,848
There, that's much... worse.

46
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:50,159
We have to talk.

47
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:53,037
Absolutely. Let's talk.
Right after the ceremony.

48
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:55,123
- Let's go!
- Ceremony?

49
00:04:55,147 --> 00:04:56,440
What ceremony?

50
00:04:57,065 --> 00:04:58,877
The Staff of Wisdom. Ooh.

51
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,671
Given to me by Master
Oogway himself. Aah.

52
00:05:01,695 --> 00:05:03,840
It is said that whoever
possesses this staff

53
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:06,801
has the power to travel
between the realms.

54
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:09,721
The power to unlock the
door to the Spirit Realm.

55
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:12,140
And now, the power to open

56
00:05:12,164 --> 00:05:16,960
the all-new Dragon
Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

57
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:23,091
Where the broth has kick and
the bean curd's a knockout.

58
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:28,573
Dragon Warrior!

59
00:05:28,597 --> 00:05:30,700
Will the Furious
Five be here too?

60
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:32,076
Unfortunately, no.

61
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,746
They're off on super
cool kung fu missions.

62
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,207
Tigress is taking on the
free-range chicken gang.

63
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,417
<i>Monkey's hot on the trail
of the missing macaque.</i>

64
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:41,252
<i>Crane was crowned king
of the Crocodilians.</i>

65
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:42,629
Crane! <i>Long story.</i>

66
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:45,506
<i>Viper's wrapping up peace talks
between the cobras and the mongooses.</i>

67
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,467
<i>Or is it mongeese?</i>

68
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:47,759
<i>And Mantis?</i>

69
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:50,827
<i>Well, he's just trying to keep his
blushing bride from biting his head off.</i>

70
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:54,432
Just 'cause they're
not here in person

71
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:57,101
doesn't mean they're not
here as life-sized cut-outs.

72
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,188
Now, who wants a picture?
Okay, okay. One at a time.

73
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,005
- Oh! Me, me, me! Me!
- You.

74
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:04,651
My turn! My turn!

75
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:05,759
And then you.

76
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:13,576
He really captured your
disapproving scowl.

77
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,810
We need to talk.

78
00:06:15,852 --> 00:06:17,455
Now.

79
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,541
Hey, can I get one of
those in a wallet size?

80
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:20,899
Po!
- Coming.

81
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:26,363
Do you remember the first time you
climbed these steps to the Jade Palace?

82
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:30,134
How could I forget? I thought
I'd never make it to the top.

83
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:31,636
Yes, but you persevered.

84
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,890
And once again, destiny calls for you
to take the next step on your journey.

85
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:37,809
The next step? What
are you talking about?

86
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,186
I've already taken all
the steps. Haven't I?

87
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,981
It is time for you to
choose your successor.

88
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,399
Successor for what?

89
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:47,819
A successor to be the
next Dragon Warrior.

90
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:49,779
Oh... [chuckles] Yeah, I get it.

91
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:52,222
Funny, 'cause I'm
the Dragon Warrior.

92
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:56,911
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

93
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:59,664
You mean, I'm not gonna be
the Dragon Warrior anymore?

94
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:01,624
- Exactly.
- Then what am I gonna be?

95
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:03,293
Once a successor is chosen,

96
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:06,421
you will advance to the highest
level in all of kung fu.

97
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:09,531
Spiritual Leader of
the Valley of Peace.

98
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:11,909
Whoa.

99
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:14,345
I don't know what that means.

100
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:16,764
It's just like Master
Oogway before you.

101
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:21,394
You will oversee the Valley, passing
along wisdom and inspiring hope.

102
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:23,646
Look, I appreciate
the promotion.

103
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,275
I think I'm just gonna stick with
the whole "Dragon Warrior" thing.

104
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:30,194
Dragon Warrior "thing"?
What is it you're holding?

105
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:31,362
A cookie.

106
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:32,655
Other hand.

107
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,365
The Staff of Wisdom.

108
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,367
It was given to you
by Master Oogway.

109
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:38,703
Do you really think it was so
you could open a restaurant?

110
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:39,954
Or pose for pictures?

111
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:41,706
He wasn't super specific.

112
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,002
Oogway entrusted you with that staff
so you could follow in his footsteps

113
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:48,963
and become something better
than you already are.

114
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:50,239
You take it.

115
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,842
No. Oogway did
not give it to me.

116
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:56,304
Being the next Oogway is not my
destiny, which I have accepted

117
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:57,597
and am at peace with.

118
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:59,641
- Really. It's fine.
- You don't sound fine.

119
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:02,268
- You don't sound fine! I'm very fine!
- Okay, you're fine.

120
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,436
This is an honor.

121
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,565
Oogway chose you as his successor,
and now you must choose yours.

122
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:10,360
Master Shifu, I finally
found something I'm good at,

123
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:12,153
and now you want to just
take it away from me?

124
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:14,322
No one is taking
anything away, Po.

125
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:16,866
Who you are will always be
a part of what you become.

126
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,619
Yeah, but where's the
"skadoosh"? You know what I mean?

127
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:21,371
The "shasha-booie"?

128
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:22,872
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

129
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:25,542
but I don't know anything about
passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

130
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:27,585
All I know are two things.

131
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:30,922
Kicking butt and taking names.

132
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:34,008
And if I'm being completely honest, I'm
not even that good at the name-taking.

133
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:36,176
Like, who was that
fire-breathing crocodile?

134
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,679
I wanna say Steve...

135
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:40,013
You were chosen to bring
peace to the Valley,

136
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:44,352
and there are other ways to bring
peace than simply kicking butt.

137
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:46,521
Well, sure. But
not any fun ones.

138
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:49,857
Please. Being the Dragon
Warrior is all I know.

139
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:52,026
- It's who I am.
- Not anymore.

140
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,195
The Valley of Peace
needs a Spiritual Leader,

141
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:56,072
and Master Oogway chose you.

142
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:59,033
You'll start interviewing candidates
first thing tomorrow morning.

143
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:01,560
Candidates? What candidates?

144
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:13,780
Awesome!

145
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:22,205
No way!

146
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,877
Wow!

147
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:28,897
Skadoosh.

148
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:30,339
Fantastic pose.

149
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:42,726
Whoo-hoo! Nice.

150
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:49,233
Master Po will now choose
the next Dragon Warrior.

151
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:54,088
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

152
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:58,116
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

153
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,244
So many great candidates.

154
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:03,247
I'm gonna let the finger decide.

155
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:06,392
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

156
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,293
What is happening?

157
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:11,630
The Dragon Warrior. It's me!

158
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:20,156
Like it or not, Po, you
have to choose a successor.

159
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,118
Eh. Nothing about them
says "dragon" or "warrior."

160
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:25,828
You will know when you know.

161
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:28,647
How do I know when
I know? You know?

162
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,110
When I'm conflicted, I come here
to ask the universe for answers.

163
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:35,338
Just as Oogway did before me.

164
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:38,383
I'm not conflicted. I'm just
not ready for a next step.

165
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:39,592
What is that you're holding?

166
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:41,052
The Staff of Wisdom?

167
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,136
Other hand.

168
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,721
A chewed-up peach pit?

169
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:45,181
Exactly.

170
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:49,561
Every pit holds the
promise of a mighty tree.

171
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:51,813
Uh, how is this gonna
help me find the answers?

172
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:54,983
Don't ask me. Ask the universe.

173
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:57,676
Be the pit, Po. Be the pit.

174
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:01,990
There we go.

175
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:03,640
All right, universe.

176
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:06,310
Give me some guidance.

177
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,521
<i>Inner peace.</i>

178
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:11,773
<i>Inner peace.</i>

179
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,817
<i>Inner peace.</i>

180
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:15,652
<i>Dinner, please.</i>

181
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:17,696
<i>Dinner with peas.</i>

182
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,841
<i>Snow peas?</i>

183
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:22,117
<i>In a sesame soy glaze.</i>

184
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:24,536
Inner peace.

185
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:26,413
Inner peace.

186
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:30,560
This is not working at all.

187
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:32,228
Maybe focus on your breathing?

188
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:34,981
I'm trying, but it's kinda hard
when you keep talking to me.

189
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:37,817
Technically, you're talking
to you, if you think about it.

190
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:40,570
Hey, will you two be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

191
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:42,906
Wait, if I'm Po's inner
voice, then who are you?

192
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,949
Uh, I'm Po's inner, inner voice.

193
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:46,534
How many voices do
I have in there?

194
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:48,703
- You do not want to know.
- This dirt is itchy.

195
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:50,371
- I just love kung fu.
- What am I gonna be?

196
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:53,275
- Are we alone in the universe?
- You guys thought it was awesome, right?

197
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,319
Anyone want a cookie?

198
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:04,785
Universe?

199
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:08,330
Is that you?

200
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,183
Attention, mysterious figure!

201
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:32,479
The Dragon Warrior's
here to perform justice.

202
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:38,211
I know you're in here.

203
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,862
Just a matter of time
before I find you.

204
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:43,490
Ooh.

205
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,585
You can't hide from
justice forever.

206
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:02,068
The Dagger of Deng Wa.

207
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:04,052
You've got excellent
taste, I'll give you that.

208
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,364
But I can't give you
that. Give it back.

209
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,140
If you insist.

210
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:21,254
Oh, no!

211
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,549
He's got a walking stick. What are
you gonna do? Stroll me to death?

212
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:28,177
This stick is not for the
strolling. It's the Staff of Wisdom.

213
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,847
The Dragon Warrior is gonna be mad
when he finds out you took his stick.

214
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:32,789
I am the Dragon Warrior.

215
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,252
I'm just gonna say it. Nothing about
you says "dragon" or "warrior."

216
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,431
Whoa.

217
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:52,059
Hi-yah!

218
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:56,164
How dare you desecrate
the Hall of Heroes?

219
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:57,707
Who's desecrating what now?

220
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:59,500
Master Ostrich's Egg!

221
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:02,212
Oops, my bad. Hi-yah!

222
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:04,589
The Indestructible Chain
Hammer of Master Pangolin.

223
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:05,864
Whoopsies.

224
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:11,370
Ha-ha! [Grunts] Oh!

225
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:20,063
The Urn of Whispering Warriors!

226
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:22,631
Which I've already
broken! Twice!

227
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:26,802
Why would you keep an urn of
souls? Feels kinda creepy.

228
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:32,617
Are you doing okay there, big guy?
You're looking a little tired.

229
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:34,518
I've never felt more awake!

230
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,064
The War Hammer of
Master Chipmunk?

231
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:43,986
You're gonna pay for that.

232
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:48,656
Hello?

233
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:00,645
You faker.

234
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:02,754
It's not faking.
It's called Method.

235
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:05,048
Catch ya later, panda.

236
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:06,883
No.

237
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:15,100
I think I'll catch you now.

238
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:21,899
Whoa!

239
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:29,740
Whoa!

240
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:32,159
Whoa!

241
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:36,724
Told ya.

242
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:39,851
You got me, oh-great-and-powerful
Dumpling Warrior.

243
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,835
That's Dragon Warrior...

244
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:44,355
Let go of me.

245
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,690
Just tell me one thing.

246
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:48,109
How did someone like you
become the Dragon Warrior?

247
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,403
That's a mystery for you to
solve during your two-year stay

248
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:51,821
at the Valley of Peace prison.

249
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:54,782
Valley of Peace prison?
Sounds like a day care.

250
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,558
It is a day care
on the weekends.

251
00:15:57,142 --> 00:15:58,745
But it's also a prison.

252
00:15:58,769 --> 00:15:59,954
There he is!

253
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:00,997
Dragon Warrior!

254
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:02,999
Tai Lung is back.
- Tai Lung has returned?

255
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:06,169
He demanded all of our iron,
then destroyed our quarry.

256
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:08,755
- He's supposed to be in the Spirit Realm.
- Well, he's back.

257
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:11,633
He said that he's not gonna stop
until the Valley of Peace falls

258
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:13,968
and the Dragon Warrior
bows before him.

259
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:16,161
- He's back.
- Please, you've got to do something.

260
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,183
Looks like I'm not the only one
around here with a mystery to solve.

261
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:22,185
Well, you know what they say

262
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:27,047
every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

263
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:51,238
Every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

264
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:58,638
Very clever, fox.
You know something.

265
00:16:58,662 --> 00:17:00,831
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

266
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:03,184
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

267
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,852
- Tell me.
- And why should I?

268
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:06,062
I mean, what's in it for me?

269
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:08,147
The peace of mind knowing
you did the right thing.

270
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:10,692
You're adorable. Has
anyone ever told you that?

271
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:12,485
And I don't mean just in,
like, the cuddly sense.

272
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:13,778
I don't have time for games.

273
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:15,947
Tai Lung is running loose
in the Valley of Peace.

274
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:20,118
Maybe. Or maybe she wants
you to think it was Tai Lung.

275
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:21,369
Wait. She?

276
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:22,686
Mine!

277
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,708
The Empress of Disguise,
capable of taking any form,

278
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:28,000
<i>mimicking any shape.</i>

279
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:29,127
<i>The master of deception.</i>

280
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,504
<i>The lizard of lies with
the glowing teal eyes.</i>

281
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:32,738
<i>I'm talking 'bout...</i>

282
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:35,490
The Chameleon.

283
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:39,745
This is kind of a
private conversation.

284
00:17:40,954 --> 00:17:42,473
Who's The Chameleon?

285
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:44,851
Only the most powerful
shape-shifting sorceress.

286
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,336
So she shape-shifted
into Tai Lung.

287
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:49,981
But what does she have against
me and the Valley of Peace?

288
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:52,150
These are good questions.
You should ask her.

289
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:56,070
You're right. How do I
find this "The Chameleon"?

290
00:17:56,094 --> 00:17:57,739
She isn't someone
who can be found.

291
00:17:57,763 --> 00:18:00,533
At least not without
someone in the know.

292
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:03,411
And how do I find
someone "in the know"?

293
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:06,497
Oh! It's me. It's
obviously... It's me.

294
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:07,790
I'm in the know.

295
00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:10,359
Forget it. I'll
find her on my own.

296
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:11,961
Good luck.

297
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:15,131
After all, how hard can it be to find
someone who can look like anyone,

298
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:16,448
blend in anywhere?

299
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,388
Fine. You lead me
to The Chameleon,

300
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:24,766
and I'll see what I can do
about reducing your sentence.

301
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,083
Deal.

302
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,269
Po!

303
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:29,562
What do you think you're doing?

304
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:33,024
There's this shape-shifting
sorceress on the loose and...

305
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:35,109
That's a job for
the Furious Five.

306
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:38,154
Well, they're not here, and someone
needs to protect the Valley of Peace.

307
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:40,031
Look, I know that
change is difficult

308
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:42,575
and that you enjoy being
the Dragon Warrior,

309
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,036
but your job is
finding a successor.

310
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,498
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal.
Mind your own business, squirrel.

311
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:50,208
Master Shifu is not a squirrel.

312
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:51,483
I'm a red panda.

313
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:54,587
You know what? I
love that for you.

314
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,214
Po, this is your decision.

315
00:18:56,238 --> 00:19:00,701
But I think you know what choice
Master Oogway would want you to make.

316
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,433
Thanks for the free
stay. What are you doing?

317
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:08,851
- Little dank for a day care.
- Wait!

318
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,395
- Not bad for a jail.
- Where is she going?

319
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:11,479
You can't leave.

320
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:14,732
Don't worry, I'll have her back
before you even know she was gone.

321
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:17,944
You are supposed to be passing
along wisdom and inspiring hope!

322
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:20,697
Just think of it as one last
Dragon Warrior adventure.

323
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:23,074
I'll be back soon. Tell
my dads I love 'em.

324
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:25,434
I can't hear you anymore! Bye!

325
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:31,457
Yeah! It sure is good
to be a free fox again.

326
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:33,126
That's a good back scratcher.

327
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,460
- Yoink!
- Hey!

328
00:19:34,484 --> 00:19:36,713
So, does this really unlock
the door to the Spirit Realm?

329
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:38,339
It doesn't work like that.

330
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:41,134
It has to be given in
order to gain its powers.

331
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:44,095
Gotcha. Given to gain.
So, can I have it?

332
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,847
No! What do you take me for?

333
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:46,931
An easy mark.

334
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:48,016
What's an easy mark?

335
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,684
Someone who's easy
to steal from,

336
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,895
usually because they're
generous and too trusting.

337
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,087
- Like you.
- Aw, thank you.

338
00:19:56,423 --> 00:20:00,778
I heard The Chameleon is a monster with
an appetite of a thousand predators,

339
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:02,906
and her favorite food is panda.

340
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,701
They say this Chameleon
character has magical powers.

341
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:10,479
If you say her name three times,
she'll take you away in the night!

342
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:15,919
The Chameleon can shape-shift
to look like anyone, even you.

343
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:17,444
Or you.

344
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:23,009
Mr. Li! Mr. Li! Is it true?

345
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,803
Po's going to take
down an evil sorceress?

346
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:27,764
The... The Chameleon?

347
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:31,100
Well, a Dragon Warrior's
work is never done.

348
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:34,354
Li, I'm thinking Po teaming
up with a convicted felon

349
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:38,233
to take down an evil sorceress
wasn't such a great idea.

350
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:43,196
Relax. Po has faced demons, demigods,
and everything else in between.

351
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,405
He's always come out on top.

352
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:46,616
You're right. You're right.

353
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,493
But what if you're wrong?

354
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:50,245
Calm down, Ping.

355
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,272
How bad can one
evil sorceress be?

356
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:57,669
Who is she to summon us?

357
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:58,920
Classic power move.

358
00:20:58,944 --> 00:21:02,298
We're the heads of Juniper City's
most prominent crime families.

359
00:21:02,322 --> 00:21:05,927
And she's just some bug-eyed,
power-hungry reptilian runt.

360
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:07,637
You left out the
evil sorceress part.

361
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:09,514
We used to run this city.

362
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:12,100
Now we pay her half
the money we swindle.

363
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:14,686
It's like a criminal can't
make an honest living anymore.

364
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,211
Yeah, but what could we do?

365
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:19,399
Together, we can take her down.

366
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:22,318
Are you nuts? She's
a shape-shifter.

367
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:26,346
She could be at this very
table, and we'd have no idea.

368
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:30,201
For all we know,
you're The Chameleon.

369
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:32,120
Or you're The Chameleon.

370
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:33,872
- Or maybe...
- Oh, no.

371
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:35,272
- Maybe...
- Don't say it.

372
00:21:35,898 --> 00:21:37,542
I'm The Chameleon.

373
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:38,775
I said don't say it.

374
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:48,177
We obviously spoke out of turn.

375
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:49,262
Sorry, Chameleon.

376
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:51,139
No, no. Don't apologize.

377
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:55,643
You and your families prospered
by preying upon the weak,

378
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:59,397
so it doesn't feel good when
you're the one being squeezed.

379
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:02,066
Especially when the
one doing the squeezing

380
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,570
is just a "bug-eyed,
power-hungry"...

381
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:07,155
What was the rest?

382
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:09,073
Reptilian runt.

383
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:13,244
Well, this "reptilian
runt" wants more.

384
00:22:13,268 --> 00:22:15,288
You already have the city.

385
00:22:15,312 --> 00:22:17,248
What else could
you possibly want?

386
00:22:17,272 --> 00:22:21,336
I have something special in mind.
I'm very close to achieving it.

387
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,130
As close as the blood moon.

388
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:25,798
But the blood moon
is two nights away.

389
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:28,426
So little time,
so many expenses.

390
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,848
Which is why I'll need to increase
this month's tribute to 60%.

391
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:34,998
No.

392
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,380
What was that now?

393
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:44,466
I mean no disrespect.

394
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:47,737
Don't worry.

395
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:53,701
I forgive you for the
impudence and the backstabbing.

396
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:59,147
And the blatant disrespect
you've shown me, I forgive.

397
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:02,001
But I never forget.

398
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:04,295
You might say I
have the memory...

399
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,505
Oh, don't say it.

400
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:07,656
Of an elephant.

401
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:26,651
You think I've
pushed you too far?

402
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:30,822
Then you, my friend,
can't begin to fathom

403
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:34,683
just how far I can push.

404
00:23:40,689 --> 00:23:43,775
I'll expect your
tributes by dawn.

405
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:49,716
Are we gonna stop
for lunch soon?

406
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,801
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

407
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:54,679
But it does take the occasional
time-out for snack age.

408
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:56,472
Wanna split my almond cookie?

409
00:23:56,496 --> 00:24:00,059
You're just gonna give me half of your
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

410
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,437
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the catch? The rub? The bamboozle?

411
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:03,397
The "bam-what-le"?

412
00:24:03,421 --> 00:24:05,440
You know, the fleece.
The rook. The flimflam.

413
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:07,049
Do you want the cookie or not?

414
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:12,512
I got my eye on you.

415
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:16,993
How much farther is it
to this "The Chameleon"?

416
00:24:17,017 --> 00:24:18,226
Just a little farther.

417
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:36,638
Li! What are you doing out here
in the middle of the night?

418
00:24:36,662 --> 00:24:40,308
Well, I... I... I... didn't
wanna miss the blood moon rising.

419
00:24:40,332 --> 00:24:43,061
Oh, pooh. You are just
as worried as I am.

420
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:44,479
All right, all right.

421
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:47,315
I know pandas come across
as calm, gentle and chill,

422
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:49,651
but... [chuckles]
...the truth is

423
00:24:49,675 --> 00:24:51,236
I'm kinda freaking out!

424
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,278
So am I.

425
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:56,574
Po is just too calm, gentle and chill
to face a shape-shifting sorceress.

426
00:24:56,598 --> 00:24:59,452
- What if he's captured?
- What if he's tortured?

427
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,395
Our baby!

428
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:03,957
Okay, okay.

429
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:06,209
Maybe Po has finally
met his match,

430
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:10,171
but there is still something that
he has that The Chameleon does not.

431
00:25:10,195 --> 00:25:12,298
- What's that?
- Us.

432
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:15,218
Now, let's go find our son.

433
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:16,427
I hope Po's okay.

434
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:19,472
You know, Li, a wise
goose once said,

435
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:22,517
"Worrying doesn't make the
broth boil any faster."

436
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:25,019
Who was that idiot?
Me, of course.

437
00:25:25,043 --> 00:25:26,563
I was the wise goose.

438
00:25:26,587 --> 00:25:28,314
Oh, yeah.

439
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:30,233
Whoa.

440
00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:32,277
That's the biggest
village I've ever seen.

441
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:34,070
That's no village.

442
00:25:34,094 --> 00:25:36,030
That's Juniper City.

443
00:25:36,054 --> 00:25:37,865
That's where I'll find
The Chameleon, huh?

444
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:39,409
Just a boat ride away.

445
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,995
And I'm gonna lead you
right to her front door.

446
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,955
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

447
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:46,899
For the right price, those cutthroats
will take us anywhere we want to go.

448
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:50,545
Of course, we could always opt
for the four-finger discount.

449
00:25:50,569 --> 00:25:51,862
No stealing.

450
00:25:52,738 --> 00:25:54,340
"The Happy Bunny Tavern".

451
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:56,241
Well, that sounds inviting.

452
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:03,165
Anybody lose a rabbit?

453
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:10,672
Stir faster!

454
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:16,154
Welcome to the
Happy Bunny Tavern.

455
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:19,014
I'll find us a ride. Maybe
you can get us some food.

456
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:20,974
And stay out of trouble.

457
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:24,579
Hey, what you guys playing?

458
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:26,331
Mah-jongg.

459
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:27,999
And the stakes are high.

460
00:26:28,023 --> 00:26:29,083
Can I play?

461
00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:32,527
Surely you'll go easy on a
beginner, 'cause I'm very beginning.

462
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:36,382
- Hey there.
- What can I get you?

463
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:38,259
A boat ride to Juniper City.

464
00:26:38,283 --> 00:26:39,368
Ask this guy.

465
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:43,890
- Who's he?
- He's the captain.

466
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:45,457
Thanks.

467
00:26:48,585 --> 00:26:51,356
Oh, I win again.
Beginner's luck, I guess.

468
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,233
Never played before, huh?

469
00:26:53,257 --> 00:26:55,235
I'm sorry, are you
accusing me of cheating?

470
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:57,528
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

471
00:26:57,552 --> 00:26:59,554
I am the manager.

472
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:04,244
I'll give you a boat ride to Juniper
City, but I won't carry anything illegal.

473
00:27:04,268 --> 00:27:05,620
I don't want any trouble.

474
00:27:05,644 --> 00:27:07,580
Trouble runs from me.

475
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:09,040
Then it'll cost you double.

476
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:11,584
I'm confused. Should I have
said that I like trouble?

477
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:13,419
In that case, it'll
cost you triple.

478
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:16,113
Oh. Uh, maybe we can go
back to the double price?

479
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:20,510
You got a deal.

480
00:27:20,534 --> 00:27:23,495
Great. Do I shake his
hand or your hand?

481
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:25,890
Can I get anything
else for you, ma'am?

482
00:27:25,914 --> 00:27:27,350
Yes. Everything, again.

483
00:27:27,374 --> 00:27:29,394
Except for the broth.
It was very bland.

484
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:31,003
Keep stirring!

485
00:27:32,504 --> 00:27:35,173
Whoa! One of everything
is my go-to order.

486
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:37,193
But how did you pay for this?

487
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:39,153
Legally. Lawfully.
Fair and square.

488
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:40,637
I'm proud of you.

489
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:52,709
Oh, wow! Look at the time.

490
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:55,628
Remember we have to do that thing
down by the place with that guy?

491
00:27:55,652 --> 00:28:00,133
Did you actually think you
could grift a meal out of me?

492
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:03,201
There's gotta be some sort
of misunderstanding here.

493
00:28:05,162 --> 00:28:07,599
And apparently, I'm the
one misunderstanding.

494
00:28:07,623 --> 00:28:10,727
Please allow us to pay for
our meal and yours too.

495
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:12,729
I'm only hungry for...

496
00:28:12,753 --> 00:28:14,188
- Dumplings?
- Vengeance!

497
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:16,149
Well, then, come and get it.

498
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:18,151
No! No, no, no! Don't
come and get it!

499
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:20,218
Destroy them!

500
00:28:32,898 --> 00:28:33,941
I got it!

501
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:45,452
There you go.

502
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:48,848
All better.

503
00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:51,601
Come on! Gotcha.

504
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,876
Keep stirring!

505
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:02,761
Oh, yeah!

506
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,031
I'll take that.

507
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:27,411
Think this belongs to you.

508
00:29:40,382 --> 00:29:41,883
No stealing!

509
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,117
Yeah, I think it's a
little too late for that.

510
00:29:49,141 --> 00:29:51,411
It's never too late
to do the right thing.

511
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:53,037
Get them!

512
00:29:53,061 --> 00:29:54,813
Watch out!
- Whoa!

513
00:30:02,154 --> 00:30:04,031
Skadoosh!

514
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:14,225
Whoa. Nice move. You
gotta teach me that.

515
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:16,376
You die, panda!

516
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,849
Ah! Uh.

517
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:33,352
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

518
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:37,415
Who designs a tavern on a cliff?

519
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:40,150
I shouldn't have eaten
all those dumplings.

520
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:42,712
Huh?

521
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:43,987
Uh-oh.

522
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:49,952
Sail ho!

523
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:59,461
Back up! Move, move, move!

524
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:04,776
Not that I'm worried, but

525
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,195
what if The Chameleon
knows we're coming?

526
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:09,405
Why, she could be
anywhere, anyone.

527
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:12,283
Li, would you please
show a little backbone?

528
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:15,787
I'm sorry, but bravery was
never really my specialty.

529
00:31:15,811 --> 00:31:20,583
You don't have to be brave.
You just have to act brave.

530
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:22,776
Act brave? Got it.

531
00:31:23,443 --> 00:31:25,421
- Ah!
- Oh!

532
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:26,839
Oh, Li!

533
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:29,217
Hold on!

534
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:32,053
Hold me, Ping! It's
all been for nothing!

535
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:33,555
Please, no.

536
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:35,998
I'm too young!

537
00:31:39,585 --> 00:31:41,271
How was that for acting brave?

538
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:43,213
Keep working on it.

539
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:49,445
Juniper City.

540
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:51,364
It's going to be great
to be back home again.

541
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:53,366
Does your family live there too?

542
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,726
They would. If I had a family.

543
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:58,896
It wasn't easy being a
little fox in a big city.

544
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:02,041
<i>So I had to survive
any way I could.</i>

545
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:03,084
Hey!

546
00:32:03,108 --> 00:32:06,212
<i>Grifting. Shilling. Gaffing.</i>

547
00:32:06,236 --> 00:32:08,864
Stop running! Stop running!

548
00:32:14,578 --> 00:32:16,931
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I.

549
00:32:16,955 --> 00:32:18,391
Well, I mean I was.

550
00:32:18,415 --> 00:32:22,312
My goose dad adopted me, and then
later, my panda dad found me.

551
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:26,024
Goose dads, panda dads.
Guess it takes all kinds.

552
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:27,591
Right, Mom?

553
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:30,445
Then, one day, a
local took me in.

554
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:33,907
Put a roof over my head, gave
me clothes to wear, food to eat.

555
00:32:33,931 --> 00:32:36,284
After that, I was
never alone again.

556
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:37,493
I guess we both got lucky.

557
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:38,536
I guess.

558
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,914
Hey, tell me something. Back
in the Valley of Geese...

559
00:32:40,938 --> 00:32:41,956
Peace.

560
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,458
What did that angry
little squirrel mean...

561
00:32:43,482 --> 00:32:44,376
Red panda.

562
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,443
When he said you had
to find your successor?

563
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:50,006
Now that I'm supposed to
become Spiritual Leader,

564
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,092
I have to find a worthy successor
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

565
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:55,261
Once you're on top, that's
where you wanna stay, right?

566
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:58,348
No, it's just that... What do I
know about being a Spiritual Leader?

567
00:32:58,372 --> 00:33:00,892
I can't even come up with one
of those cool-sounding proverbs.

568
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:03,561
"Life's greatest enemy is"...

569
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:05,796
Uh, I don't know. Stairs?

570
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,482
Okay.

571
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:09,883
Everyone knows life's
greatest enemy is time.

572
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:13,905
I guess it's just easier to
hold on to the life you know

573
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:15,406
than move on to
the one you don't.

574
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,200
Hey, that was pretty good.

575
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:18,118
Yeah.

576
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:21,979
Maybe she should be the Spiritual
Leader of the Valley of Geese.

577
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:25,917
Whoa, that guy. He
drinks like a fish.

578
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:27,484
Should he be driving?

579
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:55,613
We've come to pay
tribute, as you requested.

580
00:33:55,637 --> 00:33:57,490
Looks a little light.

581
00:33:57,514 --> 00:33:59,367
Go back out and get me more!

582
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:00,286
More?

583
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,452
But... But, Chameleon...

584
00:34:01,476 --> 00:34:05,105
Go! Before I toss you down
another flight of stairs.

585
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:11,236
At last, my destiny approaches.

586
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:20,429
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City
to every city and town and village

587
00:34:20,453 --> 00:34:24,082
from here to the Valley
of Peace and beyond!

588
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:33,358
They will all know the
name of The Chameleon!

589
00:34:33,382 --> 00:34:34,694
<i>Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!</i>

590
00:34:34,718 --> 00:34:38,907
Ah! Zhen! I had a vision.
I saw The Chameleon.

591
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:41,951
She's gonna take over cities and
towns and the Valley of Peace.

592
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:43,661
A vision?

593
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,204
While you were asleep?

594
00:34:45,228 --> 00:34:46,623
I'm pretty sure
that's just a dream.

595
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:48,416
Not a dream, a vision.

596
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,501
Either I had a bad dumpling
before I went to sleep,

597
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:52,337
or it's a Dragon Warrior thing.

598
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:54,339
We got to get to The
Chameleon and take her down.

599
00:34:54,363 --> 00:34:56,299
Well, then you're in luck.

600
00:34:56,323 --> 00:34:58,492
Welcome to Juniper City.

601
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:05,123
Whoa!

602
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:10,396
This is the place where you
can be whatever you wanna be,

603
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,690
do whatever you wanna do,

604
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:15,985
and steal whatever
you wanna steal.

605
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:17,070
Uh, if that's your thing.

606
00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:20,722
Land ho!

607
00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:23,934
Whoa. That came out of nowhere.

608
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:35,361
Ah!

609
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:37,590
- Whoa!
- Move!

610
00:35:37,614 --> 00:35:39,342
- Look out!
- Sorry!

611
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:40,450
Out of the way!

612
00:35:41,285 --> 00:35:43,221
I've never seen so
much traffic before.

613
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:45,306
You don't have rush hour
in the Valley of Peace?

614
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,624
No one's ever in that
much of a rush. Oof.

615
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:50,669
Come on!

616
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:57,193
Well, sure is good
to be home again.

617
00:35:57,217 --> 00:35:59,028
The sights. The sounds.

618
00:35:59,052 --> 00:36:01,763
The smells.

619
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:09,605
It's a wonton wonderland!

620
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:12,774
Yeah!

621
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,672
Po. Po!

622
00:36:17,696 --> 00:36:19,173
Focus!

623
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:21,259
This city is the most
amazing place I've ever seen!

624
00:36:21,283 --> 00:36:24,661
I used to feel the same way until
The Chameleon got her claws into it.

625
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:38,026
Tonight, we take
down The Chameleon.

626
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,152
Oh, yeah.

627
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:42,822
I'll show you where this villainous
sorceress lurks as she dominates the city.

628
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:45,891
Is she lurking in that villainous
tower dominating the city?

629
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:48,661
How'd you know?

630
00:36:48,685 --> 00:36:50,663
Eh, not my first time
taking down a villain.

631
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:51,748
Let's keep moving.

632
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:53,166
Hey, Zhen!
- Heya, Zhen.

633
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,334
Long time no see.

634
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:55,252
How you doing, Zhen?

635
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:57,503
Wow, you're quite
the local celeb.

636
00:36:57,527 --> 00:37:00,781
Yeah, well, let's just say a
face like mine is hard to forget.

637
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:05,595
What? You're a wanted criminal?

638
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:09,182
You sound surprised. Is this surprising?
I don't think this is surprising.

639
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:11,184
You never mentioned
you were wanted.

640
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,518
Don't worry.

641
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:14,729
The law has better things
to do than look for me.

642
00:37:14,753 --> 00:37:17,357
- Hey, fox.
- We've been looking for you.

643
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:18,483
Must be a slow workweek.

644
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:19,734
I'll handle this.

645
00:37:19,758 --> 00:37:22,904
Morning, officers.
Dragon Warrior here.

646
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:26,366
The fox and I are here on
official Dragon Warrior biz.

647
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,992
- Dragon who?
- Warrior what?

648
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:29,452
Dragon Warrior.

649
00:37:29,476 --> 00:37:31,746
Anyone? Nothing?

650
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,772
Perhaps you know me better as

651
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:36,900
the Kung Fu Panda!

652
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:39,921
Wait, wait!

653
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:41,798
Can you believe that guy?

654
00:37:41,822 --> 00:37:42,966
Aw, come on!

655
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,285
Okay, so we tried it your
way. Now we try it mine.

656
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:52,684
Wait, what's your way...

657
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,792
Sorry.

658
00:37:55,168 --> 00:37:56,878
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

659
00:37:57,504 --> 00:38:00,066
You can't run away from the
law. You're a wanted criminal!

660
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,777
Yeah? Well, it looks like
I'm not the only one.

661
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:05,071
Wow. City life
really is fast-paced.

662
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:07,055
We gotta get out of here
before they call for

663
00:38:09,308 --> 00:38:10,601
backup.

664
00:38:15,355 --> 00:38:16,749
That's a lot of bull.

665
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:18,317
Run!

666
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:26,909
- Let's go, let's go!
- Oh!

667
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,252
Ow!

668
00:39:04,863 --> 00:39:05,864
Let's go.

669
00:39:07,366 --> 00:39:09,576
Whoa! Whoa!

670
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,765
I'm falling

671
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:15,624
very slowly.

672
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:19,711
Ow!

673
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:32,391
Sorry.

674
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,740
Whew.

675
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:58,166
There they are!

676
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:02,254
We don't have time
for a drum solo!

677
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,299
We're trapped.

678
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:18,705
It isn't much farther now.

679
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:21,398
You always say that, and
it's always so much farther.

680
00:40:23,692 --> 00:40:26,504
Whoa. What is this place?

681
00:40:26,528 --> 00:40:27,964
Home sweet home.

682
00:40:27,988 --> 00:40:31,575
Some of the best crooks and criminals
in all of Juniper City live here.

683
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:37,122
Careful. These guys will steal your pants
right off ya, and you'll never know it.

684
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,811
Uh-oh.

685
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:44,087
Now, you kids be careful
with those fireworks.

686
00:40:48,717 --> 00:40:49,801
Ooh!

687
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:56,224
Ow!

688
00:41:00,604 --> 00:41:03,499
Oh!

689
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:05,752
So you're friends
with all these people?

690
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:07,045
They're practically family.

691
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:08,403
Zhen!

692
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:15,720
Oh! Is that really you?

693
00:41:15,744 --> 00:41:18,181
Han, my old mentor.

694
00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:21,142
I always knew someday you'll find
your way home back to the den.

695
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,626
And when you did.

696
00:41:24,211 --> 00:41:27,232
I'd be sure to give you
a proper homecoming.

697
00:41:27,256 --> 00:41:28,566
Family, huh?

698
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,901
More like distant cousins.

699
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:31,819
All right. How
should we do this?

700
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:34,989
Quick and painless?
Or slow and painful?

701
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:38,409
Slow and painful.
Slow and painful.

702
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:41,162
All right, you little scamps.
Slow and painful it is.

703
00:41:41,186 --> 00:41:42,705
- Hooray!
- Yay!

704
00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:44,290
You really don't wanna do this.

705
00:41:44,314 --> 00:41:45,375
And why is that?

706
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:47,627
Because if you so much
as lay one claw on me,

707
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:49,319
you're gonna have to answer to

708
00:41:50,028 --> 00:41:52,006
the Dragon Warrior.

709
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,658
Warrior, warrior,
warrior, warrior, warrior.

710
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:56,952
Who?

711
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:02,642
Oh, man. Are my adventures
really that regional?

712
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,084
Introduce them, Po,

713
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:07,170
to your fists.

714
00:42:12,217 --> 00:42:16,406
Remember, Po, there are other ways
to bring peace than by kicking butt.

715
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,408
Ah, come on. Really? Now?

716
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:20,285
Yes, now.

717
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:23,621
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner
Shifus have differing opinions?

718
00:42:23,645 --> 00:42:24,998
We are in total agreement

719
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:27,000
with our mutual disappointment

720
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:28,191
in you.

721
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:31,028
Wait.

722
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:35,699
He who resorts to violence now

723
00:42:36,909 --> 00:42:40,221
will only find more
violence later.

724
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:41,245
Huh?

725
00:42:42,706 --> 00:42:46,728
So what you're saying is, if we
don't hurt Zhen a little now...

726
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:48,688
We can hurt her a lot later.

727
00:42:48,712 --> 00:42:50,523
What? No, that's
not what I said.

728
00:42:50,547 --> 00:42:54,569
Yes! And more violence later is
better than less violence now.

729
00:42:54,593 --> 00:42:56,946
No, no. I think you're misunderstanding
the fundamental point of...

730
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,364
- More violence!
- Hooray!

731
00:42:58,388 --> 00:43:00,950
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

732
00:43:00,974 --> 00:43:03,077
You know, that panda makes
a lot of good points.

733
00:43:03,101 --> 00:43:06,706
I like it. Violence,
violence, violence.

734
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,916
No, no, no! Wait!

735
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,000
Come back!

736
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:10,984
I'll come up with better wisdom.

737
00:43:11,777 --> 00:43:13,946
You have got to
workshop those proverbs.

738
00:43:15,656 --> 00:43:17,967
Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?
- Nope.

739
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:19,802
The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

740
00:43:19,826 --> 00:43:21,721
Those are both
very common names.

741
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:23,514
- Mentored by Oogway?
- Sorry.

742
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:25,183
Trained by Master Shifu?

743
00:43:25,207 --> 00:43:27,393
- Oh! Master Shifu? Yes.
- Aha!

744
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:29,854
Everyone's heard of the
legendary Master Shifu.

745
00:43:29,878 --> 00:43:30,921
But not you.

746
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:34,383
Did someone say
"legendary"? Bring it in.

747
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,737
Look, Han.

748
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:40,740
I know we've had our differences,
but I'm really in a jam here,

749
00:43:40,764 --> 00:43:42,450
and I was hoping you
could help me out.

750
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:44,309
- Thank you.
- Don't drink that.

751
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,749
Oh!

752
00:43:49,773 --> 00:43:52,877
We just need someplace to lie low
for a while until the heat cools off.

753
00:43:52,901 --> 00:43:54,420
And why should I help you?

754
00:43:54,444 --> 00:43:57,090
Because deep down beneath
that iron-scaled exterior

755
00:43:57,114 --> 00:43:58,591
is a good-hearted soul

756
00:43:58,615 --> 00:44:00,534
who still thinks of me
as one of the family?

757
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:02,679
Fine.

758
00:44:02,703 --> 00:44:06,248
But if you're still here by nightfall,
I'm calling the bulls myself.

759
00:44:06,957 --> 00:44:07,957
Sleep tight.

760
00:44:12,337 --> 00:44:14,232
So tonight, we take
down The Chameleon.

761
00:44:14,256 --> 00:44:15,841
After you get your pants back.

762
00:44:16,717 --> 00:44:18,403
Not cool! You guys...

763
00:44:18,427 --> 00:44:20,029
Come on! Give them back.

764
00:44:20,053 --> 00:44:21,471
Those are custom.

765
00:44:27,811 --> 00:44:31,189
Yeah, this place doesn't
look very friendly.

766
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:34,401
Oh! Oh, my tail.

767
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:37,547
I'm sure everything is fine.

768
00:44:37,571 --> 00:44:39,007
This is a restaurant.

769
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:42,010
These are my people. We
speak the same language.

770
00:44:42,034 --> 00:44:43,285
You wait here.

771
00:44:45,412 --> 00:44:47,140
Salutations!

772
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:49,726
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

773
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,185
I know you're
having a good time,

774
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:55,881
but I was wondering if a panda
happened to be passing by these parts?

775
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:57,925
There was a panda here.

776
00:44:58,592 --> 00:44:59,652
You know him?

777
00:44:59,676 --> 00:45:02,471
Know him? Why, I'm his dad!

778
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,767
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hmm?

779
00:45:07,392 --> 00:45:10,979
You need to pay for what
your son did to my tavern.

780
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,254
My boy wouldn't have
done this for no reason.

781
00:45:18,278 --> 00:45:20,215
Is it possible your
broth was bland?

782
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:21,615
Try it.

783
00:45:22,115 --> 00:45:24,344
No, no!

784
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:26,346
The broth smells excellent.

785
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:30,099
You should not add a single
thing, especially not me!

786
00:45:30,123 --> 00:45:31,667
Hands off the goose.

787
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:36,648
The panda's back.

788
00:45:36,672 --> 00:45:38,107
- He's back?
- He's back?

789
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:39,216
No.

790
00:45:39,883 --> 00:45:42,946
But you're about to wish he was,

791
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,406
'cause if you think he
made a mess of this place,

792
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:48,368
you have no idea
what I'm capable of.

793
00:45:48,392 --> 00:45:51,353
Everything he learned,
he learned from me.

794
00:45:53,855 --> 00:45:55,566
Except one thing.

795
00:45:56,149 --> 00:45:57,149
Mercy.

796
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,822
I don't know where he got that,
because I don't believe in it.

797
00:46:03,156 --> 00:46:06,636
Now, this can go
one of two ways.

798
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,015
The easy way, in which
you tell me where he is,

799
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,100
or the hard way,

800
00:46:12,124 --> 00:46:14,852
in which you tell
me where he is,

801
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:16,813
but it's hard to understand
what you're saying

802
00:46:16,837 --> 00:46:18,213
because you have no teeth.

803
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,864
Mah-jongg.

804
00:46:26,888 --> 00:46:29,975
I eat mah-jongg
tiles for breakfast!

805
00:46:57,502 --> 00:46:58,712
Huh?

806
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:11,784
Stay there!

807
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:12,827
Where's our son?

808
00:47:12,851 --> 00:47:14,704
He took a boat to Juniper City.

809
00:47:14,728 --> 00:47:15,896
Which way?

810
00:47:17,105 --> 00:47:19,125
You know, a wise goose once...

811
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:20,418
Time to go.

812
00:47:20,442 --> 00:47:21,777
Uh, yeah. Right.

813
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:54,118
Okay, let's try this again.

814
00:47:54,142 --> 00:47:58,897
Stir the pot, roll the wok,
serve the dish, and ska-blam!

815
00:48:00,023 --> 00:48:02,710
Hey, where's the golden dragon
that's supposed to shoot out?

816
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:04,546
Not gonna happen with a broom.

817
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:05,713
Yeah? Still not bad though.

818
00:48:05,737 --> 00:48:11,052
Yeah. But stir later, roll higher,
and the word is "skadoosh."

819
00:48:11,076 --> 00:48:12,512
"Skadoosh" isn't a word.

820
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:14,705
And "ska-blam" is?

821
00:48:19,585 --> 00:48:20,669
Ska-blam!

822
00:48:26,216 --> 00:48:29,779
I gotta say, you're not like any
of the other masters I've met.

823
00:48:29,803 --> 00:48:31,906
Yeah, I know. There's
not a lot of pandas.

824
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,826
No, you're, like, a good guy.

825
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:37,245
Listen up. The coast is clear.

826
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:39,706
Thieves, hit the streets.

827
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,040
And you two,

828
00:48:41,064 --> 00:48:42,733
get out of my sight.

829
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:55,537
Huh?

830
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,316
I know I promised that I'd lead you
right to The Chameleon's front door,

831
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,068
but the back door seems
a little more practical.

832
00:49:09,092 --> 00:49:13,406
I gotta say, Zhen, you really
are a fox of your word.

833
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,533
A chewed-up peach pit?

834
00:49:15,557 --> 00:49:18,518
One from Master Oogway's
peach tree of heavenly wisdom.

835
00:49:19,645 --> 00:49:21,873
Eh, it's a Valley
of Peace thing.

836
00:49:21,897 --> 00:49:26,151
It's supposed to remind me that every
pit holds the promise of a mighty tree.

837
00:49:28,403 --> 00:49:30,155
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

838
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:37,722
Are you sure you wanna do this?

839
00:49:37,746 --> 00:49:40,600
As a wise Spiritual
Leader once said,

840
00:49:40,624 --> 00:49:45,671
how may one kick butt, if one
doesn't seek a butt to kick?

841
00:49:48,048 --> 00:49:49,901
You're a real piece of
work, you know that?

842
00:49:49,925 --> 00:49:51,152
Thank you.

843
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:53,780
Wait, was that a
compliment or an insult?

844
00:49:53,804 --> 00:49:54,930
Yes.

845
00:50:03,564 --> 00:50:04,564
Whoa.

846
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:09,111
Have you seen our son?

847
00:50:16,118 --> 00:50:17,220
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

848
00:50:17,244 --> 00:50:18,513
- Nope.
- Nah.

849
00:50:18,537 --> 00:50:20,497
Tell us you've seen our son.

850
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:25,419
Wait, why are they
leaving? You said yes.

851
00:50:26,253 --> 00:50:29,023
Hey, look. Po was here.

852
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:31,484
Amazing, Li, but
how can you tell?

853
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:34,529
Oh, we pandas have a gift for
seeing what others cannot.

854
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:36,972
Come on. There may be
more clues up ahead.

855
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:13,383
Why?

856
00:52:06,395 --> 00:52:07,705
That was close.

857
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:09,082
Look out!

858
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:10,357
Huh?

859
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:14,236
- Po!
- Stand back.

860
00:52:16,822 --> 00:52:18,365
Whoa!

861
00:52:19,908 --> 00:52:22,327
- They're coming!
- Hurry! Help me lift the cage!

862
00:52:29,084 --> 00:52:30,144
It's no use.

863
00:52:30,168 --> 00:52:33,064
- We gotta brace it with something.
- Here, use my staff.

864
00:52:33,088 --> 00:52:35,257
All right, stand
back. Here I go.

865
00:52:37,384 --> 00:52:38,427
Zhen?

866
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,222
Where are you taking my staff?

867
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,911
I think you mean my staff?

868
00:52:46,935 --> 00:52:50,748
You gave it to Zhen, and
now Zhen has given it to me.

869
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:53,960
"Given to gain," I
believe, is how it works?

870
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:55,587
You were right, Zhen.

871
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:57,005
He was an easy mark.

872
00:52:57,029 --> 00:52:58,381
Zhen...

873
00:52:58,405 --> 00:53:01,551
First rule of the streets:
Never trust anyone.

874
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:03,553
I taught her that.

875
00:53:03,577 --> 00:53:06,264
And you thought my
apprentice was your friend?

876
00:53:06,288 --> 00:53:07,515
Apprentice?

877
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:09,434
She's the one that took you in?

878
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:11,853
Best thing that ever
happened to her.

879
00:53:11,877 --> 00:53:15,231
You should have seen the little
guttersnipe before I found her.

880
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:17,341
<i>Mangy and half-starved,</i>

881
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:21,845
<i>hanging out with those rejects
from the Den of Thieves.</i>

882
00:53:43,325 --> 00:53:44,993
<i>She had no fear.</i>

883
00:53:46,328 --> 00:53:47,788
<i>Such potential.</i>

884
00:53:54,461 --> 00:53:56,088
So I took her in.

885
00:53:57,673 --> 00:53:59,943
I made her what she is today.

886
00:53:59,967 --> 00:54:01,527
Stand up straight.

887
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:02,695
Yes, master.

888
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:06,366
So you went through all of this just to
get me to give you the Staff of Wisdom?

889
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:07,450
Why?

890
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:13,355
I, too, came from humble beginnings
and dreamed of becoming something more.

891
00:54:13,897 --> 00:54:15,375
I wanted respect and power.

892
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:18,127
I wanted to be a
master of kung fu.

893
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:19,212
Say what?

894
00:54:19,236 --> 00:54:22,799
I was turned away from every
training hall I went to.

895
00:54:22,823 --> 00:54:26,886
They would say I was
too small, too lowly,

896
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:30,098
and that kung fu
was not my destiny.

897
00:54:30,122 --> 00:54:33,351
And so, I chose
a different path.

898
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,103
Sorcery.

899
00:54:35,127 --> 00:54:36,378
I grew.

900
00:54:37,337 --> 00:54:38,648
I excelled.

901
00:54:38,672 --> 00:54:42,485
And I got everything
I had ever dreamed of.

902
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:45,446
Everything except kung fu.

903
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:49,683
Just because I can look like Tai Lung
doesn't mean I can fight like him.

904
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:54,914
You see, Po, kung fu may
be performed by the body,

905
00:54:54,938 --> 00:54:58,001
but its secrets are
housed in the spirit.

906
00:54:58,025 --> 00:55:00,628
And now that I have access
to the Spirit Realm...

907
00:55:00,652 --> 00:55:02,839
You're gonna steal
Tai Lung's kung fu.

908
00:55:02,863 --> 00:55:06,426
His and those of every master
villain that came before me.

909
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:11,347
And once I do, no one will
dare underestimate me again.

910
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:13,415
You forgot about me.

911
00:55:16,168 --> 00:55:18,187
Don't bother, Po.

912
00:55:18,211 --> 00:55:23,359
Those bars are enchanted with some
very old and very powerful magic.

913
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:27,322
You'd need at least ten Dragon
Warriors to get through them.

914
00:55:27,346 --> 00:55:28,865
Then I won't go through them.

915
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:31,016
I'll go under them.

916
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:47,950
Well, that's frustrating
for all sorts of reasons.

917
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:57,709
Whoa!

918
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:27,239
- Po!
- Zhen?

919
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:29,342
My staff! Hand it over.

920
00:56:29,366 --> 00:56:32,345
I'm so sorry I lied to you. I
was just doing what I was told.

921
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:34,681
Apologize later. Right now,
I have to stop The Chameleon.

922
00:56:34,705 --> 00:56:36,432
Po!

923
00:56:36,456 --> 00:56:37,791
Zhen?

924
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:44,423
No!

925
00:56:50,512 --> 00:56:52,240
Well done, Zhen.

926
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:54,450
You never said you
were gonna hurt him.

927
00:56:54,474 --> 00:56:56,685
What's the second
rule of the streets?

928
00:56:57,644 --> 00:56:59,247
Someone always gets hurt.

929
00:56:59,271 --> 00:57:01,356
And make sure it's never you.

930
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,128
I just wish there
had been another way.

931
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:06,862
Third rule of the streets?

932
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:08,590
Third rule?

933
00:57:08,614 --> 00:57:11,217
Some would say it's
the most important:

934
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:14,870
No one is interested
in your feelings.

935
00:57:16,622 --> 00:57:19,124
Chop-chop! We have a
Spirit Realm to plunder.

936
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,020
And smile.

937
00:57:22,044 --> 00:57:24,230
Nobody likes a grouch.

938
00:57:24,254 --> 00:57:27,883
Honestly, Zhen, I don't know
where you pick up such bad habits.

939
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:36,600
If I could...

940
00:57:40,479 --> 00:57:41,479
Hey there.

941
00:57:42,231 --> 00:57:43,774
Whoa!

942
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,819
Get off me! Ow! Ow!

943
00:57:53,033 --> 00:57:54,409
Son!

944
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:04,628
Now save me.

945
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:06,964
Hi, Son.

946
00:58:10,759 --> 00:58:13,387
It's okay. We've got
you, Po. We've got you.

947
00:58:15,764 --> 00:58:17,116
So you followed me.

948
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,493
It was his idea.

949
00:58:18,517 --> 00:58:20,453
Okay, okay. It was
both our ideas.

950
00:58:20,477 --> 00:58:22,622
We only follow because we love.

951
00:58:22,646 --> 00:58:25,607
No, you followed because
you didn't believe in me.

952
00:58:26,817 --> 00:58:27,943
And because we love?

953
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:31,113
Well, you're right.

954
00:58:31,738 --> 00:58:33,574
I screwed up big-time.

955
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:36,261
I trusted the wrong person.

956
00:58:36,285 --> 00:58:38,870
I gave the Staff of Wisdom
right to The Chameleon.

957
00:58:40,539 --> 00:58:41,540
Oh...

958
00:58:42,249 --> 00:58:46,878
Po, that was a very
big-time screw-up.

959
00:58:49,715 --> 00:58:53,236
If only I'd listened to Master Shifu
and stayed in the Valley of Peace,

960
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,823
The Chameleon wouldn't have my staff,
and none of this would be happening.

961
00:58:56,847 --> 00:58:59,784
I was just so determined to
keep things the way they were.

962
00:58:59,808 --> 00:59:02,954
Everyone is afraid
of change, Po.

963
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:04,581
Even me.

964
00:59:04,605 --> 00:59:07,458
There was a time not so long ago

965
00:59:07,482 --> 00:59:12,380
when all I wanted to be was the
greatest noodle chef in the valley.

966
00:59:12,404 --> 00:59:13,864
So what happened?

967
00:59:14,448 --> 00:59:16,926
I became the greatest
noodle chef in the valley.

968
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,052
It's true.

969
00:59:18,076 --> 00:59:20,120
But I also became a father.

970
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:23,957
And nothing... nothing's
ever been the same since.

971
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:27,395
Change doesn't always
have to be a bad thing.

972
00:59:27,419 --> 00:59:31,006
Why do you think I always change
the menu at the restaurant?

973
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:35,153
Because if things
stayed the same forever,

974
00:59:35,177 --> 00:59:38,055
sooner or later, they
would lose their flavor.

975
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:40,783
He's right, Po.

976
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:44,078
Since I left my village, I've
become a bit of a warrior.

977
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:46,021
Strong. Brave.

978
00:59:47,439 --> 00:59:49,250
Move it.

979
00:59:49,274 --> 00:59:50,359
This way.

980
00:59:51,026 --> 00:59:53,695
Get those cages
up there. Come on.

981
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:56,591
Hmm. This looks bad.

982
00:59:56,615 --> 00:59:57,717
Really bad.

983
00:59:57,741 --> 00:59:58,801
Move it.

984
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:00,744
Come on.

985
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:10,188
Don't tell me you were actually starting
to become friends with that panda.

986
01:00:10,212 --> 01:00:12,815
What? No. It's-It's just...

987
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:16,569
When we want something, we must use
whatever is at our disposal to get it.

988
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:19,846
That's all that panda
was, something to use.

989
01:00:21,515 --> 01:00:26,204
Is that why you took me in? So I
could help you get what you wanted?

990
01:00:26,228 --> 01:00:27,622
Zhen.

991
01:00:27,646 --> 01:00:32,085
I took you in because you were clever
and ruthless and unsentimental,

992
01:00:32,109 --> 01:00:33,169
like me.

993
01:00:33,193 --> 01:00:35,547
And the day you stop
being those things

994
01:00:35,571 --> 01:00:39,926
is the day when, yes, you
stop being useful to me.

995
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:43,537
So for both of our
sakes, don't change.

996
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:55,650
Tonight, when the blood moon rises to
its highest point in the night sky,

997
01:00:55,674 --> 01:01:01,597
I will open the door to the Spirit Realm,
and all of its secrets will be mine!

998
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:10,105
Does the blood moon
always rise this slowly?

999
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,610
I seem to remember
it rising faster.

1000
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,589
No?

1001
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:18,697
Just me?

1002
01:01:19,865 --> 01:01:20,866
Hmm.

1003
01:01:22,993 --> 01:01:24,137
Ugh.

1004
01:01:24,161 --> 01:01:26,306
It's just for dramatic
effect anyway.

1005
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:29,291
I think I'm just gonna
open the Spirit Realm now.

1006
01:01:41,261 --> 01:01:42,930
Bring me Tai Lung!

1007
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,191
Tai Lung.

1008
01:01:55,275 --> 01:01:56,252
Big fan.

1009
01:01:56,276 --> 01:01:59,130
Who are you, and what are
you doing with that staff?

1010
01:01:59,154 --> 01:02:02,258
This was given to me by
an old friend of yours.

1011
01:02:02,282 --> 01:02:03,760
The puffy panda?

1012
01:02:03,784 --> 01:02:05,220
Po might be an idiot,

1013
01:02:05,244 --> 01:02:09,182
but he'd never willingly hand over
Oogway's staff to the likes of you.

1014
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:11,583
Who said anything
about willingly?

1015
01:02:20,467 --> 01:02:24,822
Hmm. Apparently I
misjudged you, lizard.

1016
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:27,325
Now, why have you
brought me back?

1017
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:29,494
I summoned you here so
that you could teach me

1018
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:31,579
your most legendary
kung fu moves.

1019
01:02:31,603 --> 01:02:34,707
I don't share my
skills with anyone.

1020
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:36,441
It wasn't a request.

1021
01:03:27,492 --> 01:03:29,470
Yes, I got it!

1022
01:03:29,494 --> 01:03:31,556
The Tai Lung nerve strike.

1023
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:33,749
The power, the precision.

1024
01:03:37,419 --> 01:03:39,606
What have you done to me?

1025
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:43,216
All of your kung fu is now mine.

1026
01:03:44,134 --> 01:03:48,573
And the best part is, I'm
just getting warmed up.

1027
01:03:48,597 --> 01:03:50,974
Bring me General Kai.

1028
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,314
Bring me Master Osprey.

1029
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:01,568
Master Bull.

1030
01:04:08,242 --> 01:04:09,302
Po, wait!

1031
01:04:09,326 --> 01:04:11,596
Please be reasonable.

1032
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,806
I'm not going anywhere
until I get my staff back.

1033
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:15,892
No staff is worth your life.

1034
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:18,311
As long as I'm still
the Dragon Warrior,

1035
01:04:18,335 --> 01:04:20,963
I won't let anyone else
get hurt because of me.

1036
01:04:37,896 --> 01:04:38,896
Po!

1037
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:40,941
You're alive!

1038
01:04:43,902 --> 01:04:46,047
Please. I made a mistake.

1039
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:48,949
So did I. Trusting you.

1040
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:50,533
I'm sorry.

1041
01:04:51,076 --> 01:04:52,887
Did your master tell
you to say that too?

1042
01:04:52,911 --> 01:04:56,123
She's not my master.
I'm leaving, for good.

1043
01:04:56,957 --> 01:04:58,226
It's the truth.

1044
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,335
I was wrong about everything.

1045
01:05:01,628 --> 01:05:04,023
What are you doing?

1046
01:05:04,047 --> 01:05:05,650
Stopping you.

1047
01:05:05,674 --> 01:05:07,527
Get out of my way, Zhen.

1048
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:08,802
No.

1049
01:05:09,595 --> 01:05:10,489
Move.

1050
01:05:10,513 --> 01:05:12,240
You want me to move?

1051
01:05:12,264 --> 01:05:13,533
Move me.

1052
01:05:13,557 --> 01:05:16,143
First you betray me, and
now you wanna fight me?

1053
01:05:17,269 --> 01:05:18,705
Why are you doing this?

1054
01:05:18,729 --> 01:05:21,732
To stop you from getting killed.

1055
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,929
What do you care if
I get killed or not?

1056
01:06:07,778 --> 01:06:09,380
Please, Po.

1057
01:06:09,404 --> 01:06:11,615
Just let me do one thing right.

1058
01:06:16,787 --> 01:06:19,623
You're not the only one who's
made some bad choices lately.

1059
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:23,728
You're really gonna go
through with this, aren't you?

1060
01:06:23,752 --> 01:06:24,854
'Fraid so.

1061
01:06:24,878 --> 01:06:27,774
And there's nothing I can
do to talk you out of it?

1062
01:06:27,798 --> 01:06:28,942
I'm afraid not.

1063
01:06:28,966 --> 01:06:30,944
You can't beat her, you know.

1064
01:06:30,968 --> 01:06:32,552
You're probably right.

1065
01:06:34,012 --> 01:06:35,430
But I have to try.

1066
01:06:37,057 --> 01:06:38,993
Get as far away from
this place as you can.

1067
01:06:39,017 --> 01:06:40,078
Po!

1068
01:06:40,102 --> 01:06:42,288
We should never have
let him come here.

1069
01:06:42,312 --> 01:06:44,541
We are such terrible fathers.

1070
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:46,459
At least you didn't
lie and betray him.

1071
01:06:46,483 --> 01:06:48,878
Well, that's true. You're worse.

1072
01:06:48,902 --> 01:06:50,797
I am a terrible friend.

1073
01:06:50,821 --> 01:06:53,508
"Friend"? That feels
a little generous, no?

1074
01:06:53,532 --> 01:06:55,718
Uh, l-let's just
give up. Surrender.

1075
01:06:55,742 --> 01:06:57,387
We can't let him
go in there alone.

1076
01:06:57,411 --> 01:06:58,972
What can we do?

1077
01:06:58,996 --> 01:07:01,432
There are just three
of us against an army.

1078
01:07:01,456 --> 01:07:04,251
Then I guess we'll just have
to get an army of our own.

1079
01:07:17,264 --> 01:07:19,141
Hey! Listen up, everybody!

1080
01:07:22,936 --> 01:07:25,564
Quack!

1081
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:29,168
Thank you.

1082
01:07:29,192 --> 01:07:31,278
The Dragon Warrior's in trouble.

1083
01:07:32,195 --> 01:07:34,281
- Who?
- You know, Po.

1084
01:07:35,741 --> 01:07:36,909
The panda.

1085
01:07:39,953 --> 01:07:42,015
No, no. A different panda.

1086
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:44,249
- I'm his father.
- I'm also his father.

1087
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,144
Okay, that doesn't matter.

1088
01:07:46,168 --> 01:07:49,814
What matters is that my friend's
in trouble and he needs my help.

1089
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:51,774
So, I need yours.

1090
01:07:51,798 --> 01:07:53,610
Why should we help you?

1091
01:07:53,634 --> 01:07:54,944
Because...

1092
01:07:54,968 --> 01:07:56,053
Because

1093
01:07:56,929 --> 01:07:58,472
it's the right thing to do.

1094
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:04,746
Stop it. Stop.

1095
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:06,104
Stop laughing.

1096
01:08:07,397 --> 01:08:09,709
Look, I know you think
it might be too late

1097
01:08:09,733 --> 01:08:14,464
for a bunch of cheats, thieves and
cutthroats like us to change our ways,

1098
01:08:14,488 --> 01:08:19,551
but a good friend once told me it's
never too late to do the right thing.

1099
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:23,096
So what you're saying is,
the more right we do now,

1100
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,140
the more wrong we can do later.

1101
01:08:25,164 --> 01:08:26,350
What? No.

1102
01:08:26,374 --> 01:08:28,895
And with The Chameleon
out of the way...

1103
01:08:28,919 --> 01:08:31,105
We can finally do all
the wrong we want.

1104
01:08:31,129 --> 01:08:33,149
I-I think you're missing
the fundamental point.

1105
01:08:33,173 --> 01:08:35,777
Violence, violence, violence.

1106
01:08:35,801 --> 01:08:39,638
Are you guys ready to do the
right thing for the wrong reasons?

1107
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:47,205
Now, you see, this mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made

1108
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:48,998
was underestimating
his opponent.

1109
01:08:49,022 --> 01:08:51,960
I never would have walked
into such an obvious trap.

1110
01:08:51,984 --> 01:08:53,485
Hey.

1111
01:08:56,071 --> 01:08:58,716
Now, you see, the mistake this Dragon
Warrior fellow made was that...

1112
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,409
Shut up, Larry.

1113
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,433
This place is crawling with
more guards than I've ever seen.

1114
01:09:07,457 --> 01:09:09,519
I'm never gonna
get to Po in time.

1115
01:09:09,543 --> 01:09:12,313
You just get to Po. We'll
take care of the guards.

1116
01:09:12,337 --> 01:09:13,690
We will?

1117
01:09:13,714 --> 01:09:15,190
I-I mean, we will.

1118
01:09:15,214 --> 01:09:16,425
But how?

1119
01:09:16,925 --> 01:09:18,593
Just leave that to me.

1120
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:51,293
General Kai?

1121
01:09:52,044 --> 01:09:53,270
Lord Shen?

1122
01:09:53,294 --> 01:09:57,233
Those are all my old
nemesis-es. Nemes-ee. Nemes-i?

1123
01:09:57,257 --> 01:10:00,278
The Chameleon is pulling
spirits from the Spirit Realm

1124
01:10:00,302 --> 01:10:02,322
and draining us
of all our moves.

1125
01:10:02,346 --> 01:10:05,158
And she's using
your staff to do it.

1126
01:10:05,182 --> 01:10:07,160
I'm here to get it back.

1127
01:10:07,184 --> 01:10:08,661
I won't hold my breath.

1128
01:10:08,685 --> 01:10:10,205
Um, I'm sorry, do I know you?

1129
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:12,022
Do you know me? It's Scott.

1130
01:10:13,815 --> 01:10:15,752
The fire-breathing crocodile?

1131
01:10:15,776 --> 01:10:18,838
Oh, right! Scott!

1132
01:10:18,862 --> 01:10:21,132
Master Shifu and I were
just talking about you.

1133
01:10:21,156 --> 01:10:22,616
Panda.

1134
01:10:23,242 --> 01:10:26,995
Oogway made a mistake choosing
you as the Dragon Warrior.

1135
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:32,227
I just didn't realize how big
a mistake it was until now.

1136
01:10:32,251 --> 01:10:34,771
Whoa. Tai Lung?

1137
01:10:34,795 --> 01:10:38,316
I'm gonna get that staff
back, restore your kung fu,

1138
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,777
and return you all back
to the Spirit Realm.

1139
01:10:40,801 --> 01:10:42,111
You'll see.

1140
01:10:42,135 --> 01:10:43,470
All I see

1141
01:10:44,304 --> 01:10:46,223
is a broken promise.

1142
01:10:51,353 --> 01:10:55,833
All right, you bunch of
cantankerous Komodos.

1143
01:10:55,857 --> 01:10:59,128
Now, this can go
one of two ways.

1144
01:10:59,152 --> 01:11:02,924
The easy way, in which
you surrender willingly,

1145
01:11:02,948 --> 01:11:07,053
or the hard way, where
you surrender woundedly.

1146
01:11:07,077 --> 01:11:09,871
The choice is yours.

1147
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:16,128
I was kidding! I was kidding!

1148
01:11:25,053 --> 01:11:26,054
Aw.

1149
01:11:28,265 --> 01:11:29,808
Ow! Ow!

1150
01:11:32,144 --> 01:11:33,145
Thanks, Ping.

1151
01:11:37,482 --> 01:11:38,609
Run away!

1152
01:11:42,863 --> 01:11:45,699
Cannonball!

1153
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:55,351
Oh, is it too spicy?

1154
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:58,104
Mmm. No. It's got
the perfect kick.

1155
01:11:58,128 --> 01:12:01,381
Ginseng. That's the secret
to my mulberry punch.

1156
01:12:08,347 --> 01:12:11,600
That panda was right. More
violence later is better!

1157
01:12:12,225 --> 01:12:13,560
Yay!

1158
01:12:19,524 --> 01:12:22,110
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1159
01:12:25,489 --> 01:12:27,634
Can't you even die right?

1160
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:29,594
Can't you even kill wrong?

1161
01:12:29,618 --> 01:12:31,930
No. Wordplay didn't
come together.

1162
01:12:31,954 --> 01:12:33,288
Now, about that staff...

1163
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:36,643
Take it.

1164
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:39,336
I already have everything
I need from it anyway.

1165
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,106
I think this was destiny.

1166
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:46,611
A final face-off between
formidable adversaries,

1167
01:12:46,635 --> 01:12:49,447
alike in so many ways.

1168
01:12:49,471 --> 01:12:51,074
If only I had a
dumpling for every time

1169
01:12:51,098 --> 01:12:52,992
a villain told me how
much we had in common.

1170
01:12:53,016 --> 01:12:54,077
It's true.

1171
01:12:54,101 --> 01:12:56,412
We've both risen to
the highest of heights.

1172
01:12:56,436 --> 01:12:59,541
It's a shame only one of
us can come out on top.

1173
01:12:59,565 --> 01:13:02,168
It is a shame, for you.

1174
01:13:02,192 --> 01:13:07,131
My combined powers of sorcery
and kung fu make me unstoppable.

1175
01:13:07,155 --> 01:13:11,594
And once I dispense with you, I'll
expand my rule from Juniper City to...

1176
01:13:11,618 --> 01:13:13,388
Every other city
and town and village

1177
01:13:13,412 --> 01:13:15,139
from here to the Valley
of Peace and beyond.

1178
01:13:15,163 --> 01:13:16,349
Yeah, I know.

1179
01:13:16,373 --> 01:13:18,434
But how did you know?

1180
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:22,421
I saw it in a vision because
I'm the Dragon Warrior,

1181
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:25,900
for now at least.

1182
01:13:25,924 --> 01:13:29,511
But I've realized that it's
probably time I made a change.

1183
01:13:30,596 --> 01:13:31,990
And so should you.

1184
01:13:32,014 --> 01:13:34,867
I'm The Chameleon. I
do nothing but change.

1185
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:36,703
Only on the outside.

1186
01:13:36,727 --> 01:13:39,455
Real change happens from within.

1187
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:41,916
And if we're really
as alike as you say,

1188
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,960
then maybe we could both
let go of who we were

1189
01:13:43,984 --> 01:13:46,403
and become something
better than we already are.

1190
01:13:47,195 --> 01:13:49,698
- What do you say?
- I say...

1191
01:13:52,284 --> 01:13:53,785
Well, I saw that coming.

1192
01:13:56,079 --> 01:13:57,765
We're very proud of you.

1193
01:13:57,789 --> 01:13:58,975
You tried it our way.

1194
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:01,102
Now try it yours.

1195
01:14:01,126 --> 01:14:03,354
Kick her butt.

1196
01:14:03,378 --> 01:14:05,297
I'm way ahead of you.

1197
01:14:13,347 --> 01:14:15,515
Master Elephant's Trunk Twist.

1198
01:14:18,894 --> 01:14:20,812
Master Boar's Tusks of Terror.

1199
01:14:21,897 --> 01:14:23,899
Master Wolf's Fangs of Fury.

1200
01:14:28,946 --> 01:14:30,906
Master Bull's Horns of Doom.

1201
01:14:33,325 --> 01:14:34,510
What?

1202
01:14:34,534 --> 01:14:35,869
Recognize this move?

1203
01:14:38,497 --> 01:14:41,184
Is that how I sound? I
don't sound like that, do I?

1204
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:44,461
You didn't earn those
skills. You just stole them!

1205
01:14:45,545 --> 01:14:47,106
Give him a left,
a right, uppercut.

1206
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:50,693
- Which one are you rooting for?
- I'm not sure. This is all very confusing.

1207
01:14:50,717 --> 01:14:53,446
I'm stronger than every
opponent you've ever faced,

1208
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:56,866
because I am every
opponent you've ever faced.

1209
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:57,890
Po!

1210
01:15:10,445 --> 01:15:13,216
Whoa. I gotta workshop
those heroic entrances.

1211
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,534
Nah, it was just right.

1212
01:15:17,369 --> 01:15:20,682
I knew I should have left you to
rot in the gutter where you belong.

1213
01:15:20,706 --> 01:15:23,333
Better to rot in the gutter
than under your thumb.

1214
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:33,319
Two against one?

1215
01:15:33,343 --> 01:15:35,530
Well, now, that
doesn't seem fair.

1216
01:15:35,554 --> 01:15:37,723
I'll have to even the odds.

1217
01:15:38,932 --> 01:15:40,601
Master Cobra.

1218
01:15:41,268 --> 01:15:43,329
Master Osprey.

1219
01:15:43,353 --> 01:15:45,373
Master Scorpion.

1220
01:15:45,397 --> 01:15:47,417
Master Wolf.

1221
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:49,878
General Kai.

1222
01:15:49,902 --> 01:15:51,194
Lord Shen.

1223
01:15:55,407 --> 01:15:58,452
That is awesome!

1224
01:15:59,578 --> 01:16:01,580
I mean, it's disturbing,
but it's awesome.

1225
01:16:18,972 --> 01:16:19,972
Whoa!

1226
01:16:20,724 --> 01:16:22,225
Zhen!

1227
01:16:34,613 --> 01:16:36,657
No!

1228
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,331
Whoa, whoa!

1229
01:16:56,885 --> 01:16:58,136
Po!

1230
01:17:04,977 --> 01:17:06,645
I thought we were friends.

1231
01:17:08,522 --> 01:17:09,582
Stand back.

1232
01:17:09,606 --> 01:17:11,942
I'm gonna kick my butt.

1233
01:18:34,691 --> 01:18:35,960
Come on, Po, get out of there.

1234
01:18:35,984 --> 01:18:38,421
- You have to do this.
- I can't beat The Chameleon.

1235
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:40,048
A wise, old tortoise
once told me

1236
01:18:40,072 --> 01:18:42,300
that you never know what
you can do until you do it.

1237
01:18:42,324 --> 01:18:44,469
The fate of the world
hangs in the balance,

1238
01:18:44,493 --> 01:18:47,055
and you're here giving me
life advice from a tortoise?

1239
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:48,664
Be the pit, Zhen.

1240
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:50,999
Be the pit.

1241
01:19:00,759 --> 01:19:02,403
And what do you
think you're doing?

1242
01:19:02,427 --> 01:19:04,155
Finishing what Po started.

1243
01:19:04,179 --> 01:19:07,057
Oh, please. How many times
do I have to tell you?

1244
01:19:09,059 --> 01:19:10,477
Don't slouch.

1245
01:19:20,487 --> 01:19:22,757
You ungrateful little urchin.

1246
01:19:22,781 --> 01:19:26,952
After all I've done for you,
you betrayed me for the panda?

1247
01:19:27,953 --> 01:19:31,683
First rule of the streets:
Never trust anyone.

1248
01:19:31,707 --> 01:19:35,103
Ha! You can't defeat me.
I know all your moves.

1249
01:19:35,127 --> 01:19:36,688
Not this one.

1250
01:19:36,712 --> 01:19:40,316
Roll, stir, serve,

1251
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:42,467
and ska-blam!

1252
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:50,034
Yes!

1253
01:19:50,058 --> 01:19:53,353
Second rule: Someone
always gets hurt.

1254
01:19:53,979 --> 01:19:55,582
Now, that's a cool move.

1255
01:19:55,606 --> 01:19:58,418
Po! You could have gotten out
of that cage anytime you wanted?

1256
01:19:58,442 --> 01:19:59,586
You faker.

1257
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:01,671
It's not faking. It's Method.

1258
01:20:01,695 --> 01:20:04,883
Besides, how's a peach pit
ever supposed to become a tree

1259
01:20:04,907 --> 01:20:07,701
if you never give it
the chance to grow?

1260
01:20:09,953 --> 01:20:12,765
And, hey, you stirred
faster and rolled higher.

1261
01:20:12,789 --> 01:20:15,792
But for the last
time, the word is

1262
01:20:22,925 --> 01:20:24,051
"skadoosh."

1263
01:20:49,826 --> 01:20:52,537
Maybe Oogway was
right about you.

1264
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:57,626
You aren't completely
useless after all.

1265
01:20:58,502 --> 01:21:00,045
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

1266
01:21:10,472 --> 01:21:12,909
That's my son.

1267
01:21:12,933 --> 01:21:14,101
Our son.

1268
01:21:15,143 --> 01:21:19,314
I think it's time you
send us home, panda.

1269
01:21:53,724 --> 01:21:56,077
Zhen, do something!

1270
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:59,897
Third rule: No one's
interested in your feelings.

1271
01:22:04,985 --> 01:22:08,989
See you on the other
side, Dragon Warrior.

1272
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:33,615
We packed some food
for your time in jail.

1273
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:36,409
Let's hope it's not
your final meal.

1274
01:22:36,433 --> 01:22:37,976
Thanks, guys.

1275
01:22:38,852 --> 01:22:43,541
I was thinking, after I serve my
time and I'm a free fox again,

1276
01:22:43,565 --> 01:22:46,377
maybe I'll open one of those acupuncture
places that are all the rage.

1277
01:22:46,401 --> 01:22:51,240
I think you're better suited for a job
with a little more room for growth.

1278
01:22:55,077 --> 01:22:56,078
Jade Palace?

1279
01:22:57,913 --> 01:22:59,641
Her?

1280
01:22:59,665 --> 01:23:03,519
Out of all the candidates you choose
to train as your worthy successor,

1281
01:23:03,543 --> 01:23:05,230
you chose the fox?

1282
01:23:05,254 --> 01:23:07,315
You know when you
know, you know?

1283
01:23:07,339 --> 01:23:09,943
Fine, choose who you want.
A thief, a stick, a carrot.

1284
01:23:09,967 --> 01:23:11,736
I don't even know why I bother.

1285
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,596
I'm going to go
meditate... a lot.

1286
01:23:17,057 --> 01:23:18,934
Don't worry. He'll come around.

1287
01:23:19,601 --> 01:23:21,603
Probably. Maybe.

1288
01:23:23,397 --> 01:23:24,982
Hey, you okay?

1289
01:23:26,942 --> 01:23:29,653
He's right. What about me
says I'm ready for this?

1290
01:23:30,862 --> 01:23:33,132
Well, as I learned from
working in my dad's kitchen,

1291
01:23:33,156 --> 01:23:37,720
sometimes the greatest dishes come
from the most unlikely ingredients.

1292
01:23:37,744 --> 01:23:39,806
Hey, that's not bad.

1293
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:41,641
Okay, I see you,
Spiritual Leader.

1294
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:44,477
Yeah. I'm getting the hang
of this proverb thing.

1295
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:47,605
One shouldn't do a deep squat
with a chopstick in one's pocket.

1296
01:23:47,629 --> 01:23:49,607
Maybe you should just
stick to kicking butt.

1297
01:23:49,631 --> 01:23:53,486
Money can't buy happiness, but it
sure can buy a lot of dumplings.

1298
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:55,822
Why does it always come
back to dumplings with you?

1299
01:23:55,846 --> 01:24:00,577
When life gives you lemons, make
pear juice and blow everyone's minds.

1300
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:01,661
We get it.

1301
01:24:01,685 --> 01:24:04,605
You can't have your moon
cake and eat it too.

1302
01:24:05,188 --> 01:24:08,418
Although, I guess you could have moon cake
and then order mango pudding on the side.

1303
01:24:08,442 --> 01:24:10,360
Can we just start
the training now?

1304
01:24:12,946 --> 01:24:14,364
Inner peace.

1305
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,700
Inner peace.

1306
01:24:17,492 --> 01:24:18,761
Inner peace.

1307
01:24:18,785 --> 01:24:19,846
Hey, Master Shifu.

1308
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:20,930
Look, there's two of us.

1309
01:24:20,954 --> 01:24:23,057
- You're doing great, Shifu.
- You're not breathing with your belly.

1310
01:24:23,081 --> 01:24:24,917
- You look a little tired.
- Are you tired?

1311
01:24:26,668 --> 01:24:28,879
- You do look like a squirrel.
- Do you want a cookie?

1312
01:24:33,634 --> 01:24:35,302
Inner peace.

1313
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,180
Inner peace.

1314
01:24:39,556 --> 01:24:41,350
Inner peace.

1315
01:24:49,816 --> 01:24:51,610
Are you ready to
begin your training?

1316
01:24:52,194 --> 01:24:53,421
Are you?

1317
01:24:53,445 --> 01:24:56,031
Yes, and I brought
a little help.
