1
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:33,017
When a man loves a woman

2
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:36,729
Can't keep his mind
on nothin' else

3
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:42,402
He'd change the world for
the good thing he's found

4
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:47,782
If she is mad he can see it

5
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:51,494
She can do no wrong

6
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,705
Turn his back
on his best friend

7
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,041
If he put her down

8
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:02,547
When a man loves a woman

9
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,342
Spend his very last dime

10
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:11,973
Tryin' to hold on
to what he needs

11
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:17,270
He'd give up all his comforts

12
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:21,232
And sleep out in the rain

13
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:25,987
If she said that's the way
it ought to be

14
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,661
Well, this man loves you, woman

15
00:01:36,622 --> 00:01:41,461
I'd give you everything I had

16
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:49,802
Tryin' to hold on
to your high-class love

17
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:56,142
Baby, please don't treat me bad

18
00:01:56,267 --> 00:02:01,939
When a man loves a woman

19
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:05,652
Down deep in his soul

20
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:10,031
She can bring him such misery

21
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,704
If she plays him for a fool

22
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:19,290
He's the last one to know

23
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,922
Lovin' eyes can never see

24
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:29,217
When a man loves a woman

25
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,136
Right.

26
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:35,640
Right. That...

27
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,434
and that.

28
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:41,479
And that is cricket, hon.

29
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,401
Do you want it?

30
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:48,611
Sure.

31
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,989
Doesn't matter if you don't.

32
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:55,410
You know, I won't be offended.
Jody's never offended.

33
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:58,413
- What you say your name was?
- Jude.

34
00:02:58,496 --> 00:03:02,125
Jude. Why,
that suits you, Jude.

35
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,086
- The teddy bear?
- No! Fuck this bear.

36
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:08,464
The name: Jude.

37
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:11,467
And it is Jude, right?

38
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,681
I gotta piss, Jude.

39
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,766
Over here.

40
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:21,728
Jude in June

41
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:25,314
Jude, my baby

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,276
I said Baby, baby

43
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:30,653
Here. Don't run off, Jude.

44
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,655
You don't know me, do ya?

45
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,158
- What if I did?
- You'd know I wouldn't run off.

46
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:45,501
- Never pissed holdin' a girl's hand, Jude.
- Ya didn't?

47
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:48,921
- You know what?
- Tell me, Jody.

48
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:51,424
It's nice.

49
00:03:54,677 --> 00:03:56,721
Not here.

50
00:03:56,846 --> 00:03:59,766
- Who gives a fuck?
- Ya never know.

51
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:01,893
I never know nothing.

52
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:05,938
- People. They could be lookin'.
- Let 'em look.

53
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:36,761
- Come and get me, soldier.
- Whatever you say, Jude.

54
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:41,099
I said Baby, baby

55
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:44,018
Baby, whatcha doin' to me

56
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:48,523
I said Baby, baby

57
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:51,818
Baby, whatcha doin' to me

58
00:04:58,074 --> 00:05:01,202
What the fuck...

59
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:03,538
Get off. Get off.

60
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:06,082
Get it on! Get it on.

61
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:12,588
Come on!

62
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:20,096
Jude!

63
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:23,808
She wears that
silk blue sweater

64
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:27,186
She likes to wear
her stockings black

65
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:36,738
So, what's your name, soldier?

66
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:40,283
- Fuck you.
- Yeah.

67
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:31,751
The situation is simple.

68
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:35,088
You're being held hostage
by the Irish Republican Army.

69
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:39,300
They've got one of our senior members
under interrogation in Castlereagh.

70
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:43,429
We've informed 'em that if they don't
release him within three days...

71
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:46,432
you'll be shot.

72
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:49,936
You'll be treated as our guest
until further developments.

73
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,938
Have you anything to say?

74
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:57,694
Give him a cup of tea.

75
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,863
You want a cup of tea?

76
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,128
Thanks, Jude.

77
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:19,132
See does he want some.

78
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:21,718
Do you want some food?

79
00:07:32,854 --> 00:07:35,565
Hey.

80
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,527
What's he like?

81
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,447
Horny bastard.

82
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,828
Did you give him it?

83
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:53,124
There're certain things
I wouldn't do for my country.

84
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,796
Have a look at him.

85
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:00,882
Can't.

86
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:05,219
Poke him or somethin'.
See if he's still alive.

87
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:10,308
- He's all right.
- Hasn't moved for twelve hours.

88
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:14,395
Go on. Have a heart.

89
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:36,959
You fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!

90
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:38,836
You fucking whore!

91
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:41,839
You fucking whore!

92
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:44,342
Give me a knife!
I'll cut his fuckin' heart out!

93
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,928
Give me a knife! Jesus!

94
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,732
You all right?

95
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:02,527
- Fuckin' animal.
- Come on, Jude.

96
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,322
What do you mean "Come on"?
I had him all over me!

97
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:09,826
Yeah.

98
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:14,831
- Tough work, that.
- Well, someone's gotta do it.

99
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,335
Nah, it was a breeze.

100
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:22,922
I just thought of you.

101
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:26,926
- You know what, Fergus?
- What?

102
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:30,596
One of you made me want it.

103
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:33,141
Which one?

104
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:46,779
Hold it there. To your left.

105
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:52,118
Walk on. It's okay.

106
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,457
Around, around to your left.

107
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:03,129
Gonna open the door.

108
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,548
Move to your left.

109
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,926
Walk in. That's it.

110
00:10:09,052 --> 00:10:13,973
Listen, soldier, you
should eat somethin'.

111
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:17,643
- Can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

112
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:21,856
I can't eat
through a canvas bag.

113
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:28,279
Okay. Okay.

114
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:31,282
Here.

115
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,082
Fuckin' hell, man!
This is a farce!

116
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:44,420
- How is it a farce?
- I seen your fucking face!

117
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:47,382
So, what do I look like?

118
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:52,470
You're the one about 5'10"
with the killer smile...

119
00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:54,722
and the baby face.

120
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,433
- Oh, am I?
- Yeah.

121
00:10:57,517 --> 00:11:01,437
And the brown eyes.

122
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:03,523
You're the handsome one.

123
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:16,703
- Thank you, handsome.
- My pleasure.

124
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:27,672
I can't fuckin' breathe, man.

125
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:31,342
Be a Christian, will ya?

126
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:36,347
Tell him to take
the hood off, honey.

127
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:38,766
How'd you know it was her?

128
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:42,729
I can smell her perfume.

129
00:11:42,812 --> 00:11:46,274
See, if we took the hood off,
we'd have to shoot you.

130
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:49,152
As it is, you got
a fifty-fifty chance.

131
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:51,612
I thought you liked me,
you bitch.

132
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:54,949
It was fun while it lasted.

133
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:57,327
Nice lady.

134
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:04,250
Please, man. I'm suffocatin' in here.
Take it off.

135
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:09,464
- Can we not take it off?
- Have to check with himself.

136
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:14,344
Here. You mind him.

137
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,929
Don't leave me with her, man!

138
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:20,683
She's dangerous!

139
00:12:25,313 --> 00:12:28,232
Peter? Can I take
the prisoner's hood off?

140
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:30,234
Why do you want to do that?

141
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:32,570
- Poor whore's suffocatin' in the heat.
- So?

142
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:35,156
- Anyway, he's seen our faces.
- He's seen your face.

143
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:39,327
Yeah, and he saw Jude as well.
Peter...

144
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:41,704
If you don't mind him seein',
I don't mind;

145
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:44,707
- But you're the only one he looks at.
- Right. Thanks.

146
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,710
It's your decision.

147
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:56,219
- Leave him to me, Jude.
- My pleasure.

148
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:25,623
Thank you, soldier.

149
00:13:29,836 --> 00:13:32,672
Never thought fresh air
would taste this good.

150
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:39,137
Now, if you loose up my hands,
I could feed myself.

151
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:42,098
No fuckin' way.

152
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:45,268
I'm only joking.

153
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:50,356
You know, I was wrong
about one thing.

154
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:54,277
- And what's that?
- You're no pinup.

155
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:58,114
- No?
- No. You're not handsome at all.

156
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:01,159
- Are you tryin' to hurt my feelings?
- No.

157
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:05,621
- It's the truth.
- I could say the same thing about you.

158
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:08,166
- Could you?
- But I won't.

159
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:14,130
- We're more polite around these parts.
- So I've noticed.

160
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,886
- Hey.
- What is it now?

161
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:22,847
You're gonna have
to do it, aren't you?

162
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,518
- Do what?
- Kill me.

163
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:30,480
What makes you think that?

164
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:33,650
They're not gonna
let that guy out...

165
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,527
and you're gonna have
to kill me.

166
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,905
- They'll let him out.
- You want to bet?

167
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:42,367
- I'm not a gamblin' man.
- And even if they do...

168
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:45,244
you can't just let me loose.

169
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:48,414
- Why can't we?
- Not your nature.

170
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,416
What do you know
about my nature?

171
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,127
I'm talkin' 'bout
your people, not you.

172
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:57,006
What the fuck do you know
about my people?

173
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:00,343
Only that you're all tough,
undeluded motherfuckers...

174
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:03,513
and it's not in your nature
to let me go!

175
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:07,517
Shut the fuck up, would ya?

176
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:15,483
Here.

177
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,652
You know a funny thing?

178
00:15:17,777 --> 00:15:22,865
- No. What's the funny thing?
- I didn't even fancy her.

179
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:25,910
Didn't look like that to me.

180
00:15:26,035 --> 00:15:29,122
She's not my type.

181
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:31,541
No?

182
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,377
No.

183
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:38,047
- Come here.
- No.

184
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:39,716
Come here.

185
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,760
I wanna show you something.

186
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:46,556
- What?
- My inside pocket.

187
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,111
Take out my wallet.

188
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:08,619
Open it.

189
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:12,498
Inside there's a picture.

190
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:16,169
No, not that one.

191
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:19,130
There's another.

192
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,093
Now, she's my type.

193
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:29,599
- She'd be anybody's type.
- Don't you think of it, fucker.

194
00:16:29,682 --> 00:16:32,602
- Why not?
- She's mine.

195
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:35,021
Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.

196
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:39,567
- No?
- Absolutely not.

197
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:42,862
Is she your wife?

198
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:45,782
I guess you could say that.

199
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:50,620
- You make a nice couple.
- Don't I know it.

200
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:53,623
So what were you
fuckin' around for then?

201
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:55,792
You fuckers set me up.

202
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,752
That... That bitch.

203
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:02,715
She's a friend of mine.

204
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:09,806
Okay. That nice lady.

205
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:12,725
She meets me in a bar.

206
00:17:14,143 --> 00:17:15,687
I'm thinkin' to myself:

207
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,898
"What the fuck
am I doin' here anyway?"

208
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:21,567
- What the fuck were you doin' here?
- I got sent.

209
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:24,362
- You could've said no.
- Can't once I signed up.

210
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:27,907
- Why did you sign up?
- It was a job.

211
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:30,076
Yeah, a job.

212
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:32,787
So I get sent to
the one place in the world...

213
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,623
where they call you "nigger"
to your face.

214
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:37,208
Shouldn't take it personally.

215
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:44,716
"Go back to
your banana tree, nigger."

216
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:48,344
There's no use tellin' 'em
I come from Tottenham.

217
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:52,390
- And you like cricket?
- Best game in the world.

218
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:54,517
Ever see hurling?

219
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,478
That game where a bunch of paddies
whack sticks at each other?

220
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:00,356
- Best game in the world. The fastest.
- Never.

221
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:03,985
Well, in Antigua, cricket's
the black man's game.

222
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,988
Kids play it
from the age of two.

223
00:18:07,113 --> 00:18:10,158
My dad had me throwin' googlies
from the age of five.

224
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:13,328
Then we moved to Tottenham
and it was somethin' different.

225
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:16,080
- How was it different?
- Toffs' game there.

226
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:19,834
But not at home.

227
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:23,338
So, when you come
to shoot me, Paddy...

228
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:28,051
remember you're gettin' rid
of a shit-hot bowler.

229
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,639
I'll bear it in mind.

230
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:37,644
And by the way...

231
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:43,316
it's not "Paddy." It's Fergus.

232
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:47,987
Nice to meet you, Fergus.

233
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:51,532
My pleasure, Jody.

234
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:00,291
Stay. Wait. Wait!

235
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:04,712
Take it easy now. Just go slow.
Down by that tree.

236
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:07,715
Tree. Tree.

237
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,676
Right.

238
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:17,850
- You gotta loosen my hands.
- Can't.

239
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:21,020
Can't?

240
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:24,983
Then you're gonna have to take my dick
out for me, aren't you?

241
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:30,530
Come on, man!
I'm gonna wet my pants.

242
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:44,836
Take the fucker out, man.
I'm dying.

243
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:56,681
I gotta lean forwards,
or dribble all over myself.

244
00:19:56,764 --> 00:20:00,101
Would you hold my hands for me?

245
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:13,531
Now, that is worth waiting for.

246
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:17,410
- Hurry up, will ya?
- These things take time, Fergus.

247
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:21,205
It's amazing how
these small details...

248
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:25,209
take on such importance,
isn't it?

249
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,962
Now put it back in.

250
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:33,551
- Give us a break.
- I can't do it!

251
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,554
It's only a piece of meat.

252
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:40,099
For fuck's sake,
it's got no major diseases!

253
00:20:47,774 --> 00:20:49,651
Thank you.

254
00:20:51,027 --> 00:20:53,196
I had a case of the clap
two years ago.

255
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:56,157
- Crabs in Ulster.
- Shut up, will ya!

256
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,160
But, all in all,
it served me pretty well.

257
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:02,872
- Get inside, will ya?
- I didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.

258
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:10,046
Fergus.

259
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:13,216
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

260
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:17,845
I... I know that
wasn't very easy for you.

261
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:22,016
The pleasure was all mine.

262
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,690
Oh, no, it was mine.

263
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:32,193
Believe me, it was my pleasure.

264
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:38,032
- What the fuck is this?
- Nothin', man.

265
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:40,743
He just took me out for a pee.

266
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:43,788
Put the fuckin' hood on him.

267
00:21:51,254 --> 00:21:53,339
- What the fuck is this?
- Nothin'.

268
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:55,675
He's just got a sense of humor,
that's all.

269
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,678
When you're on duty
you'll keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

270
00:21:58,803 --> 00:22:03,016
- Go on and get some sleep.
- Yeah, get some sleep.

271
00:22:20,742 --> 00:22:23,578
Did he talk?

272
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:27,707
Didn't make you laugh?

273
00:22:28,624 --> 00:22:30,209
Here, have some breakfast.

274
00:22:30,335 --> 00:22:32,503
Good morning, Fergus.

275
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:36,049
- So, he knows your name?
- Yeah, I told him.

276
00:22:36,174 --> 00:22:39,260
Are you all there? Come here.

277
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:42,347
I said come here!

278
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,141
Back in a minute, Jody.

279
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:54,233
You'll have minimum contact
with that prisoner!

280
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,526
Yeah, okay.

281
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,819
- You know why?
- Why?

282
00:22:56,944 --> 00:23:01,407
Because tomorrow we might
have to shoot him, that's why.

283
00:23:12,043 --> 00:23:16,631
They givin' you
trouble, Fergus?

284
00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:18,675
It happens.

285
00:23:18,758 --> 00:23:21,678
There's two kinds of people:

286
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:25,682
Those who give
and those who take.

287
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:30,353
Take off the hood, man.

288
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:35,233
It's okay.

289
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:39,362
I understand.

290
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:42,991
Don't mind if
I prattle on, do you?

291
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:50,790
I take it by your silence
that you don't.

292
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:53,793
Two types, Fergus:

293
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:57,714
The scorpion and the frog.

294
00:23:57,797 --> 00:24:00,133
Ever heard of 'em?

295
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:07,015
A scorpion wants to cross the river,
but he can't swim.

296
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,686
Goes to a frog who can
and asks for a ride.

297
00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:15,189
Frog says,
"If I give you a ride on my back...

298
00:24:15,315 --> 00:24:17,692
you'll go and sting me."

299
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:21,279
Scorpion replies, "It would not be
in my interest to sting you..."

300
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:25,033
since, as I'll be on your back,
we both would drown."

301
00:24:25,158 --> 00:24:28,703
Frog thinks about this logic for a while
and accepts the deal.

302
00:24:28,828 --> 00:24:33,416
Takes the scorpion on his back,
braves the waters...

303
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:38,588
halfway over feels a burning spear
in his side...

304
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:43,051
and realizes the scorpion
has stung him after all.

305
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:47,347
And as they both
sink beneath the waves...

306
00:24:47,472 --> 00:24:50,350
the frog cries out...

307
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:53,895
"Why'd you sting me
Mr. Scorpion?

308
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,733
For now we both will drown."

309
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:02,779
Scorpion replies...

310
00:25:02,904 --> 00:25:08,117
"I can't help it.
It's in my nature."

311
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:13,706
So what's that
supposed to mean?

312
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:16,959
Means what it says.

313
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:22,340
A scorpion does
what is in its nature.

314
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:29,514
Take off the hood, man.

315
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:34,560
- Why?
- 'Cause you're kind...

316
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:38,564
and it's in your nature.

317
00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:58,376
See? I was right about you.

318
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:01,379
Don't be so sure.

319
00:26:01,504 --> 00:26:03,715
Jody's always right.

320
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:11,180
Where would you most
like to be now, man?

321
00:26:11,264 --> 00:26:15,727
- Doesn't matter where.
- Come on, man.

322
00:26:15,852 --> 00:26:20,440
If this shit was all over.

323
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:26,279
Havin' a pint in the Rock.

324
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:29,282
You lack imagination, Fergus.

325
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:33,244
Think of something more...
alluring.

326
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:35,955
Like what?

327
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,667
Like... havin' a pint
in the Metro.

328
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:47,216
- Havin' two pints in the Rock.
- Havin' a pint in the Metro...

329
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:49,886
and Dil's havin' a margarita.

330
00:26:49,969 --> 00:26:52,597
- Who's Dil?
- Special friend.

331
00:26:52,722 --> 00:26:54,849
Oh, yeah.

332
00:26:54,974 --> 00:27:00,146
- We got simple tastes, you and me.
- Yup, the best.

333
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:04,567
But you guys never
get a break, do you?

334
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:07,487
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah.

335
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:11,282
We do a tour of duty
and we're finished.

336
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:14,285
But you guys are never finished,
are you?

337
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,331
We don't look on it that way.

338
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:20,750
Often wonder how you do it.

339
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,461
It depends what you believe in.

340
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:26,339
- What do you believe in?
- That you guys shouldn't be here.

341
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:28,299
- That simple?
- Yeah.

342
00:27:32,595 --> 00:27:35,723
- Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
- He's hot!

343
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:38,351
Doesn't matter if he's hot.
Just cover the fucker up.

344
00:27:38,476 --> 00:27:40,561
You got no feelings, woman!

345
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:43,564
You shut your face!

346
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:48,945
- You're headed for trouble, Fergus.
- Okay, okay.

347
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,740
He's a good soldier...

348
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:56,411
I said shut the fuck up.

349
00:27:57,996 --> 00:28:01,290
- He believes in the future.
- Is that right?

350
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:31,446
Is it bad?

351
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:34,490
Not bad.

352
00:28:37,493 --> 00:28:39,620
Women are trouble.

353
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:43,041
- Do you know that, Fergus?
- I didn't.

354
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,337
Some kinds of women are.

355
00:28:47,462 --> 00:28:50,673
She can't help it.

356
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:59,015
Dil, she was no trouble,
no trouble at all.

357
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:04,437
- You liked her?
- Present tense, please, please.

358
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,608
Love her...

359
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:11,694
wherever she is.

360
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:18,576
I'm thinkin' of her now.
Would you think of her too?

361
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:22,622
I don't know her.

362
00:29:22,747 --> 00:29:24,791
I want you
to do something for me.

363
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:26,709
What?

364
00:29:26,793 --> 00:29:30,713
- If they kill me...
- Don't think that way.

365
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,299
But they will...

366
00:29:33,424 --> 00:29:36,302
as sure as night follows day.

367
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:38,888
They have to.

368
00:29:38,972 --> 00:29:42,392
I want you to find her out.

369
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:45,937
Tell her I was thinkin' of her.

370
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:50,817
- See if she's all right.
- I don't know her.

371
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:54,195
Take her picture. It's...

372
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,323
Come here.
It's in my inside pocket.

373
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:06,082
Take the whole lot.
I won't need it.

374
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:10,461
I told you not
to talk that way.

375
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:15,258
Go to Millies Hair Salon
in Spittalfields.

376
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:19,345
Take her to the Metro
for a margarita.

377
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,181
You don't have
to tell her who you are.

378
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:23,474
You just tell her
Jody was thinkin' of her...

379
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,809
Stop it.

380
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:43,786
Volunteer?

381
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:49,584
We need you inside.

382
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:08,436
We've heard word.

383
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:12,023
They've used every trick in the book
and he's beginnin' to talk.

384
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:16,444
You're gonna have
to do it in the mornin'.

385
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:22,950
You okay about that?

386
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,912
- I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
- Good.

387
00:31:25,995 --> 00:31:29,040
Beginnin' to have me doubts
about you the past few days.

388
00:31:29,165 --> 00:31:31,042
- Not the only one.
- Shut up, Jude.

389
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:35,129
Better get some sleep
tonight, Fergus.

390
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:40,051
- Peter.
- What?

391
00:31:40,176 --> 00:31:42,845
Request permission to guard
the prisoner tonight.

392
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:45,598
- You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
- Shut the fuck up, Jude.

393
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:51,562
- What do you want to do that for?
- It would make me feel better about it.

394
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:55,191
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

395
00:31:56,651 --> 00:32:01,114
Okay. You're
a good man, Fergus.

396
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,378
- Don't.
- I... I'm sorry.

397
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:23,594
Help me.

398
00:32:25,596 --> 00:32:30,101
- How can I?
- I don't know.

399
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:34,063
I don't know.

400
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:37,275
Just help me.

401
00:32:42,488 --> 00:32:44,490
Give me a cigarette.

402
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:04,802
I don't even...
I don't even smoke.

403
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:11,726
Thought it was
the right thing to do.

404
00:33:24,072 --> 00:33:28,576
- Go to sleep now.
- I don't want to sleep.

405
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,703
Tell me something.

406
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:34,999
- What?
- A story.

407
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:38,211
- Like the one about the frog?
- And the scorpion?

408
00:33:38,336 --> 00:33:40,963
No. No.

409
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:44,717
Tell me anything.

410
00:33:44,842 --> 00:33:48,721
- "When I was a child..."
- Yeah?

411
00:33:51,224 --> 00:33:55,728
"I thought as a child."

412
00:33:55,853 --> 00:33:58,731
But when I became a man...

413
00:33:58,856 --> 00:34:02,568
"I put away childish things."

414
00:34:04,112 --> 00:34:07,115
What does that mean?

415
00:34:07,198 --> 00:34:09,993
Nothing.

416
00:34:10,118 --> 00:34:12,495
Nothing?

417
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,124
Tell me something.

418
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:19,168
Anything.

419
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:28,970
Not a lot of use,
are you, Fergus?

420
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:33,850
Me?

421
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:38,730
No.

422
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:41,357
I'm not good for much.

423
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:13,264
Come on, stand up.

424
00:35:15,975 --> 00:35:17,810
Turn to your right.

425
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:22,565
Okay, step up. One step.

426
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:25,943
Okay, turn to your right.

427
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:28,946
Go forward. Step up.

428
00:35:36,162 --> 00:35:38,206
Now to the left.

429
00:35:42,418 --> 00:35:44,128
I wish to say on behalf of
the Irish Republican Army...

430
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:45,588
Leave him be!

431
00:36:00,478 --> 00:36:03,398
Take the hood off, Fergus.

432
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:05,358
No.

433
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:09,737
I want to see you a bit, please.
Please.

434
00:36:09,821 --> 00:36:13,741
Don't make me die
like an animal.

435
00:36:25,795 --> 00:36:29,048
I'm glad you're doin' it.

436
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:31,467
Do you know that, Fergus?

437
00:36:31,551 --> 00:36:35,805
- Why?
- 'Cause you're my friend.

438
00:36:35,888 --> 00:36:40,810
- And I want you to go to the Metro.
- Stop that talk now!

439
00:36:42,437 --> 00:36:45,064
Hurling's a fast game,
isn't it, Fergus?

440
00:36:45,148 --> 00:36:46,357
The fastest.

441
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:48,735
- Faster than cricket?
- Cricket's in the ha'penny place.

442
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,363
So if I ran, there's no way
I could beat you, is there?

443
00:36:52,447 --> 00:36:55,825
- You won't run!
- But if I did...

444
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,244
you wouldn't shoot
a brother in the back.

445
00:36:58,328 --> 00:36:59,704
Jody!

446
00:37:01,456 --> 00:37:04,000
- You stupid bastard!
- What'd you say, faster?

447
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:07,712
- I said you bastard! Stop!
- Gotta catch me first.

448
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:10,006
Used to run the mile, you know,

449
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:11,716
four times
around the cricket pitch.

450
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,320
- What was that game called?
- Hurling!

451
00:37:14,344 --> 00:37:16,512
- What? What?
- Hurling!

452
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:21,601
Told you I was fast?

453
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:30,360
Don't do it.

454
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:38,493
Jody!

455
00:37:44,624 --> 00:37:46,751
All line up! Follow me!

456
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:01,432
Over here now!

457
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:04,060
Jude! Run!

458
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:40,013
Fergus.

459
00:38:40,138 --> 00:38:42,098
You're back on the bike, Tommy?

460
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:47,061
- How're ya keepin'?
- All right.

461
00:38:47,186 --> 00:38:52,066
- And notice I've asked you nothin'.
- That's wise, Tommy.

462
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:56,195
All right then.
I like bein' wise.

463
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,327
So what do you need, Fergus?

464
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:05,788
- Need to go across the water.
- Do ya now?

465
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:08,374
Need to lose myself
for a while.

466
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:11,210
Aye.

467
00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:15,673
There's a man I know
ships cattle to London.

468
00:40:46,472 --> 00:40:48,891
We're closing.

469
00:40:50,143 --> 00:40:52,103
You deaf?

470
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:55,356
- I'll see you tomorrow, Dil.
- 'Night.

471
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:58,943
- Want something in particular?
- Just a bit of a trim.

472
00:40:59,027 --> 00:41:01,195
Come on.

473
00:41:18,463 --> 00:41:21,674
- Someone recommended you?
- In a way.

474
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:26,429
- Who?
- A guy I work with.

475
00:41:26,512 --> 00:41:30,266
- What's his name?
- Does the water not get to your nails?

476
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:33,561
- What's it to you?
- Nothing.

477
00:41:36,147 --> 00:41:38,191
- You American?
- No.

478
00:41:38,316 --> 00:41:41,152
- You're not English.
- No.

479
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:44,572
- Scottish?
- How'd you guess?

480
00:41:44,656 --> 00:41:48,910
- The accent, I suppose.
- What's it like?

481
00:41:50,203 --> 00:41:52,372
Like treacle.

482
00:41:54,165 --> 00:41:57,543
Nice laugh.

483
00:42:05,468 --> 00:42:08,972
There. That should
make her happy.

484
00:42:10,181 --> 00:42:13,768
- Who's "she"?
- Don't know. Who is "she"?

485
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:52,849
- Hi, Dil.
- Hi ya, hon.

486
00:42:52,932 --> 00:42:55,476
- All right?
- I suppose.

487
00:42:59,397 --> 00:43:02,692
- Yes? What'll it be?
- Bottle of Guinness.

488
00:43:02,817 --> 00:43:05,737
Bottle of Guinness.

489
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:09,991
- See that, Col?
- See what, Dil?

490
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:12,702
- He gave me a look.
- Did he?

491
00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:15,204
- I just cut his hair, you know.
- Yeah?

492
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:19,542
- So what do you think?
- Nice.

493
00:43:22,587 --> 00:43:24,839
There. He did it again.

494
00:43:24,922 --> 00:43:28,509
- I saw that one. That was a look.
- What would you call that?

495
00:43:30,136 --> 00:43:32,138
Ask him to ask me
what I'm drinking.

496
00:43:32,263 --> 00:43:34,349
She wants to know do you want
to know what she's drinking.

497
00:43:34,474 --> 00:43:36,434
A margarita.

498
00:43:42,732 --> 00:43:45,109
Now he can look.

499
00:43:49,072 --> 00:43:52,325
Ask him does he
like his hair, Col.

500
00:43:52,408 --> 00:43:55,244
She wants to know, sir,
do you like your hair.

501
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:58,998
- Tell her I'm very happy with it.
- He's Scottish, Col.

502
00:43:59,123 --> 00:44:02,001
- Scottish?
- Yeah.

503
00:44:02,126 --> 00:44:05,088
- What he say?
- He agreed that he was.

504
00:44:05,213 --> 00:44:08,549
And what do you think
his name might be?

505
00:44:08,633 --> 00:44:11,094
I have no thoughts
on the subject.

506
00:44:11,177 --> 00:44:13,388
- Jimmy.
- Jimmy?

507
00:44:13,471 --> 00:44:15,807
Jimmy. That's what he said.

508
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:18,267
Hi ya, Jimmy.

509
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:20,436
Hi, Dil.

510
00:44:24,232 --> 00:44:26,734
- Sing us a song, Dil.
- Fuck off, Dave.

511
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:29,445
Come on, babe.
You know what I like.

512
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,656
Easy!

513
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,793
- Shit.
- Where d'you think you're goin'?

514
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:46,879
Piss off, Dave.
Get off my case!

515
00:44:46,963 --> 00:44:48,881
Fuckin' cow!

516
00:45:02,228 --> 00:45:05,565
- Go on, get in there!
- Stop pushing.

517
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,942
This is the last time.

518
00:45:54,947 --> 00:45:57,492
- One run!
- Come on!

519
00:46:02,205 --> 00:46:04,957
So, Pat's a cricket fan, is he?

520
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:07,919
It's not Pat. It's Jim.

521
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:11,255
I don't actually give a fuck
whether it's Jim, Pat or Mick...

522
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:14,050
as long as you remember
you're not at Lords, all right?

523
00:46:23,393 --> 00:46:24,811
Here, love.

524
00:46:24,936 --> 00:46:29,148
- So, I see you're a regular, sir.
- Is that good or bad?

525
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:34,028
Well, you get to say, "The usual, Col,"
things like that.

526
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:43,287
- Here. Let's call this the usual.
- Thanks.

527
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:46,249
- No, no. It's on me.
- Thanks very much.

528
00:46:49,794 --> 00:46:51,295
You can take it out
if you want.

529
00:46:54,215 --> 00:46:57,135
Came to see her, didn't you?

530
00:46:57,218 --> 00:46:58,886
Listen, there's something
I should tell you. She's...

531
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:02,682
- She's what?
- She's on.

532
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,736
I know all there is to know

533
00:47:14,861 --> 00:47:17,989
About the crying game

534
00:47:22,452 --> 00:47:25,663
I've had my share

535
00:47:25,788 --> 00:47:28,916
Of the crying game

536
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:37,967
- First there are kisses
- Kisses

537
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:41,721
Then there are sighs

538
00:47:41,846 --> 00:47:46,851
And then before
you know where you are

539
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:50,938
You're saying good-bye

540
00:47:52,357 --> 00:47:56,486
One day soon
I'm gonna tell the moon

541
00:47:56,611 --> 00:48:00,031
About the crying game

542
00:48:03,326 --> 00:48:07,372
And if he knows

543
00:48:07,497 --> 00:48:10,833
Maybe he'll explain

544
00:48:14,671 --> 00:48:18,341
- Why there are heartaches
- Heartaches

545
00:48:19,842 --> 00:48:23,554
Why there are tears

546
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,974
And what to do

547
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:28,559
To stop feelin' blue

548
00:48:28,643 --> 00:48:31,729
When love disappears

549
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:38,611
Don't want no more

550
00:48:38,695 --> 00:48:42,865
Of the crying game

551
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:49,163
Don't want no more

552
00:48:49,247 --> 00:48:53,167
Of the crying game

553
00:48:57,714 --> 00:49:00,883
Don't know what you said
to make me love you so

554
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:04,304
I only know I never
wanna let you go

555
00:49:04,429 --> 00:49:06,764
- He's still looking, Col.
- Persistent.

556
00:49:06,889 --> 00:49:09,934
- Good thing in a man.
- An excellent quality.

557
00:49:10,018 --> 00:49:12,770
- Maybe he wants something.
- I expect he does.

558
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:16,691
- Ask him.
- Ask him yourself.

559
00:49:16,816 --> 00:49:19,777
So tell me.

560
00:49:19,861 --> 00:49:22,488
- Everybody wants something.
- Not me.

561
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:24,574
Not you? How quaint.

562
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:28,202
How old-fashioned and quaint,
isn't it, Col?

563
00:49:28,286 --> 00:49:30,747
- You old-fashioned?
- Must be.

564
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,082
- Got the money, Dil?
- Fuck off, Dave.

565
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:35,877
- You fuckin' promised.
- Did I?

566
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,297
You fucking did!
Well, didn't you?

567
00:49:39,422 --> 00:49:40,965
Well, come on!

568
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:46,638
It takes all types.

569
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:50,933
- So who's he?
- He's what she should run a mile from.

570
00:49:52,185 --> 00:49:54,145
Then why doesn't she?

571
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:56,439
Who knows the secrets
of the human heart?

572
00:49:58,232 --> 00:50:01,569
As long as we're together
honey, I don't care

573
00:50:01,653 --> 00:50:04,989
'Cause you started somethin'
Oh, can't you see

574
00:50:05,073 --> 00:50:08,785
And ever since we met
you've had a hold on me

575
00:50:09,827 --> 00:50:11,120
All right, good night.

576
00:50:11,245 --> 00:50:12,622
You can't come in here, love.

577
00:50:20,922 --> 00:50:22,924
- Don't be like that.
- You heard me.

578
00:50:23,049 --> 00:50:25,510
We're fuckin' grand
all of a sudden?

579
00:50:25,635 --> 00:50:29,347
- Talk to me, you stupid bitch!
- Piss off, Dave.

580
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:30,932
Hi.

581
00:50:33,184 --> 00:50:35,353
Hi. You forgot your bag.

582
00:50:35,478 --> 00:50:37,772
- Thank you. Jimmy.
- Who the fuck's he?

583
00:50:37,897 --> 00:50:39,857
- It's him, isn't it?
- Maybe.

584
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,074
- See, they get the wrong idea.
- Cunt.

585
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:50,785
- What was that?
- They all get the wrong idea.

586
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:53,663
- Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt!
- Charming.

587
00:50:53,788 --> 00:50:55,832
- What'll I do?
- Break his neck.

588
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,376
No, don't.

589
00:50:58,459 --> 00:51:01,337
He's gonna take his foot off
slowly, David...

590
00:51:01,421 --> 00:51:05,008
and you're to go home
like a good boy, you hear?

591
00:51:06,092 --> 00:51:07,302
Cunt.

592
00:51:09,554 --> 00:51:11,139
Come on, honey.

593
00:51:16,811 --> 00:51:21,232
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.

594
00:51:21,316 --> 00:51:23,735
What was all that about?

595
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:26,738
He wants me to perform for him.

596
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:30,658
- Perform?
- You know.

597
00:51:30,742 --> 00:51:33,661
- You on the game?
- God, no.

598
00:51:33,745 --> 00:51:36,664
I'm a hairdresser.

599
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:39,709
He's gettin' up.

600
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:44,297
Can't leave me then, can you?

601
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:02,148
- You want me to ask you in, right?
- No. Didn't say that.

602
00:52:02,273 --> 00:52:06,319
But I'm not cheap, you know that?
Loud, but never cheap.

603
00:52:10,531 --> 00:52:12,700
Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt!

604
00:52:14,077 --> 00:52:18,206
If you kiss me,
it would really get his goat.

605
00:52:32,011 --> 00:52:34,973
Now, if you ask me
to meet you tomorrow...

606
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:38,977
it would really
drive him insane.

607
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:43,272
- Where?
- Half-five at Millies.

608
00:52:58,121 --> 00:52:59,747
Give me that look again.

609
00:52:59,831 --> 00:53:03,751
- What look?
- The one you gave me in the Metro.

610
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:11,092
Darling, you shouldn't have.

611
00:53:13,553 --> 00:53:15,930
- What's that about?
- They're jealous.

612
00:53:16,014 --> 00:53:20,018
- Why?
- I wonder.

613
00:53:33,656 --> 00:53:37,076
Now's the time you
meant to do something, isn't it?

614
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,621
- Like what?
- Make a pass or something.

615
00:53:40,705 --> 00:53:44,625
- Isn't that the way it goes?
- Must be.

616
00:53:48,796 --> 00:53:52,508
- Have you got a special friend, Jimmy?
- How special?

617
00:53:52,634 --> 00:53:56,179
- Do you want one?
- Christ!

618
00:53:57,472 --> 00:53:58,848
Jesus.

619
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:04,896
- That Dave?
- The things a girl has to put up with.

620
00:54:07,023 --> 00:54:10,443
I'm frightened, Jimmy.
That's not like him.

621
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:16,824
Piss off, Dave!

622
00:54:19,535 --> 00:54:21,663
Tough guy?

623
00:54:21,746 --> 00:54:24,666
Are you gonna be
all right on your own?

624
00:54:24,749 --> 00:54:28,044
But I'm not on my own, am I?

625
00:54:38,096 --> 00:54:41,265
It won't hurt you to come in.

626
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,604
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, please.

627
00:54:46,688 --> 00:54:50,566
- What'll it be?
- Whiskey.

628
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:57,865
Yeah! Hey!

629
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:01,202
- Come on, Dil!
- Somebody out there.

630
00:55:01,327 --> 00:55:03,538
Jesus fucking Christ.

631
00:55:04,706 --> 00:55:06,582
Hey, Dil!

632
00:55:07,917 --> 00:55:11,838
- Hey, Stirling fucking Moss!
- It's Dave!

633
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:15,550
- Come on, Dil, talk to me!
- Sure, Dave.

634
00:55:15,633 --> 00:55:18,261
Come on! Hey, Dil...

635
00:55:18,386 --> 00:55:21,347
- Hey, they're my clothes!
- Take your clothes...

636
00:55:21,472 --> 00:55:25,310
- Don't throw my clothes out the window!
- And fuck off...

637
00:55:25,393 --> 00:55:28,354
- back to Essex!
- Fuckin' mad!

638
00:55:28,438 --> 00:55:31,691
Don't chuck my clothes out!

639
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:37,989
Take your fucking goldfish too!

640
00:55:38,072 --> 00:55:41,617
My fuckin' fish!

641
00:55:45,747 --> 00:55:46,998
Murderer!

642
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:53,379
Sorry.

643
00:55:55,173 --> 00:55:57,592
How does he drive
with his neck in a brace?

644
00:55:57,675 --> 00:55:59,594
Must be in love to manage that.

645
00:55:59,677 --> 00:56:03,056
Doesn't know the meaning
of the word.

646
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:06,851
- Did he live here with you?
- He tried to.

647
00:56:08,603 --> 00:56:10,521
Sit down, will you?

648
00:56:12,106 --> 00:56:14,484
What about him?

649
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:16,694
He was different.

650
00:56:18,279 --> 00:56:20,198
How different?

651
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:23,785
As different
as it's possible to be.

652
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:26,537
Tell me about him.

653
00:56:26,663 --> 00:56:28,539
No.

654
00:56:31,626 --> 00:56:34,045
Shouldn't I go?

655
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:36,130
Yes.

656
00:56:54,649 --> 00:56:56,567
No.

657
00:56:59,153 --> 00:57:02,657
Did you do that to him?

658
00:57:02,782 --> 00:57:06,327
- You want to know how I kissed him?
- Yes.

659
00:57:07,412 --> 00:57:10,498
- Are you jealous?
- Maybe.

660
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:13,876
That's good.

661
00:58:09,307 --> 00:58:11,893
What would he think?

662
00:58:12,018 --> 00:58:15,813
He can't think. He's dead.

663
00:58:20,443 --> 00:58:24,530
In Ireland. He was a soldier.
Went there like a fool.

664
00:58:24,614 --> 00:58:28,076
- Do you miss him?
- What do you think?

665
00:58:29,869 --> 00:58:35,083
- I think you do.
- You say that like a gentleman.

666
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:38,169
- Do I?
- Like you're concerned.

667
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:50,264
You can't stay. You know that.

668
00:58:50,348 --> 00:58:53,017
Didn't think I could.

669
00:58:53,101 --> 00:58:55,019
Real gentleman.

670
00:58:59,774 --> 00:59:03,069
- Shouldn't you be in mourning?
- I am.

671
00:59:23,965 --> 00:59:31,965
There'll be bluebirds over

672
00:59:32,098 --> 00:59:34,851
The white cliffs of Dover...

673
00:59:34,934 --> 00:59:37,186
- Look, Dil, I'm sorry.
- Fuck off, Dave.

674
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:39,272
No, I won't fucking fuck off.

675
00:59:39,355 --> 00:59:42,442
- I said I'm sorry, didn't I?
- Yeah. I heard.

676
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:44,444
You hear, Jimmy?

677
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:49,782
I was only gonna ask her
for a dance.

678
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:51,784
Shall we?

679
00:59:53,870 --> 01:00:00,710
There'll be love and laughter

680
01:00:01,794 --> 01:00:03,671
Did he come here too?

681
01:00:03,755 --> 01:00:07,467
- Is this an obsession of yours?
- Maybe.

682
01:00:07,592 --> 01:00:09,594
He did, sometimes.

683
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:12,055
Did he dance with you?

684
01:00:12,138 --> 01:00:15,975
What do you want with me,
Jimmy?

685
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,020
- I want to look after you.
- What does that mean?

686
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,982
It's something I heard
someone say once.

687
01:00:23,107 --> 01:00:26,235
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

688
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:28,696
Why?

689
01:00:30,573 --> 01:00:31,866
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

690
01:00:31,949 --> 01:00:39,123
The valley will bloom again

691
01:00:39,248 --> 01:00:46,047
Johnny will go to sleep

692
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:52,261
In his room there's room again

693
01:00:52,387 --> 01:00:58,935
There'll be love and laughter

694
01:00:59,018 --> 01:01:01,604
You're not havin' me on,
are you?

695
01:01:01,688 --> 01:01:03,856
'Cause Dil can't stand that.

696
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:07,402
No.

697
01:01:07,527 --> 01:01:10,279
She does get very upset.

698
01:01:12,615 --> 01:01:16,744
Just you wait

699
01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:17,369
And

700
01:01:21,082 --> 01:01:21,582
See

701
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,642
One for him too.

702
01:01:43,021 --> 01:01:45,189
Drink.

703
01:01:45,273 --> 01:01:48,234
- What is this?
- I'm superstitious. Drink.

704
01:01:51,988 --> 01:01:54,907
Can't leave me now.

705
01:01:54,991 --> 01:01:57,785
The thing is,
can you go the distance?

706
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:01,247
- Depends what it is.
- Depends on nothing.

707
01:02:04,876 --> 01:02:06,961
In one.

708
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,057
What you thinkin' of, hon?

709
01:02:20,475 --> 01:02:23,478
- I'm thinkin' of your man.
- Why?

710
01:02:23,603 --> 01:02:26,147
I'm wonderin' why
you keep his things.

711
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:28,441
I told you.

712
01:02:28,524 --> 01:02:30,568
I'm superstitious.

713
01:02:31,903 --> 01:02:35,907
Did he ever tell you
you were beautiful?

714
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:38,743
All the time.

715
01:02:38,868 --> 01:02:41,496
Even now.

716
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:44,874
- What do you mean?
- He looks after me.

717
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:47,418
He's a gentleman too.

718
01:03:08,356 --> 01:03:10,358
Wait just one minute.

719
01:03:42,098 --> 01:03:43,891
Would he have minded?

720
01:04:02,618 --> 01:04:04,537
You did know, didn't you?

721
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:09,083
Oh, my God.

722
01:04:11,711 --> 01:04:13,671
Jesus, I feel sick.

723
01:04:15,298 --> 01:04:17,925
Don't go, Jimmy!

724
01:04:20,011 --> 01:04:22,513
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

725
01:04:33,191 --> 01:04:36,110
What were doing in the bar
if you didn't know?

726
01:04:38,946 --> 01:04:41,407
Oh, I'm bleeding.

727
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:52,210
It's all right, Jimmy.
I can take it.

728
01:04:52,335 --> 01:04:54,212
Just not on the face.

729
01:04:57,423 --> 01:04:59,842
See, I'm not a young thing
any longer.

730
01:05:03,596 --> 01:05:05,765
Funny the way things go.

731
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:08,226
Don't you find that, Jimmy?

732
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,353
Never the way you expect it.

733
01:05:15,316 --> 01:05:17,610
I'm sorry.

734
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:20,989
You mean that?
Don't go! Say something!

735
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:27,620
Jesus.

736
01:05:59,235 --> 01:06:02,864
Now this love may not be
what we're looking for

737
01:06:02,989 --> 01:06:06,909
This is not what we are
looking for

738
01:06:08,286 --> 01:06:10,872
I almost ran It was not

739
01:06:10,955 --> 01:06:14,083
No, no, no
Walkin' out that door

740
01:06:16,461 --> 01:06:19,756
- Forget the future
- He's back, Col.

741
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,550
Hi.

742
01:06:22,634 --> 01:06:24,552
Don't want any of those looks, Col.
They don't mean much.

743
01:06:24,636 --> 01:06:27,639
- Stop it, Dil!
- No! Tell him to go fuck himself!

744
01:06:27,764 --> 01:06:29,891
She wants me to tell you
go fuck yourself!

745
01:06:30,016 --> 01:06:32,016
- I'm sorry.
- Tell him to stop messin' Dil around!

746
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:33,895
- Dil!
- Tell him it hurts.

747
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:37,732
- I've got to talk to her, Col.
- He says he's got to talk to you.

748
01:06:37,857 --> 01:06:39,233
- Come on, Dil.
- Where?

749
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,235
Tell him again,
Col, go fuck himself!

750
01:06:43,404 --> 01:06:45,573
Until tomorrow

751
01:06:46,949 --> 01:06:50,787
One day soon
I'm gonna tell the moon

752
01:06:50,912 --> 01:06:55,625
About the crying game

753
01:06:58,211 --> 01:07:01,756
And if he knows

754
01:07:01,881 --> 01:07:05,468
Maybe he'll explain

755
01:07:09,097 --> 01:07:12,266
Why there are heartaches

756
01:07:14,227 --> 01:07:18,064
Why there are tears

757
01:07:26,906 --> 01:07:29,242
- Come here, darlin'!
- Hey! Hey!

758
01:07:42,046 --> 01:07:44,048
Off you go.

759
01:07:46,718 --> 01:07:49,512
How much did that frame cost,
Mr. Franknum?

760
01:07:49,595 --> 01:07:51,514
200 quid, Mr. Deveroux.

761
01:07:51,597 --> 01:07:55,727
Well, your bloody Pat
has just cost me 200 quid.

762
01:07:55,852 --> 01:07:57,061
Sorry.

763
01:07:57,145 --> 01:07:59,522
Sorry isn't gonna bring
the bloody thing back, is it?

764
01:07:59,605 --> 01:08:01,899
- Not in my experience.
- No.

765
01:08:05,236 --> 01:08:07,989
- Off his wages.
- Do you mean that?

766
01:08:08,114 --> 01:08:10,450
He wants to know whether
I mean it, Mr. Franknum.

767
01:08:10,533 --> 01:08:12,035
I'm sure you do.

768
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,037
Bloody right I do.

769
01:08:15,371 --> 01:08:17,915
Well, is that Pat's tart?

770
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:21,461
- Does Pat have a tart?
- She's not a tart.

771
01:08:21,586 --> 01:08:25,506
- No, of course not. She's a lady.
- No, she's not that either.

772
01:08:38,394 --> 01:08:42,148
Darlin'. Never let the sun
go down on an argument...

773
01:08:42,273 --> 01:08:45,985
- as Jody used to say.
- What are you doing here?

774
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:48,112
Got your note.

775
01:08:48,196 --> 01:08:50,437
- So let's kiss and make up, honey.
- Don't call me that.

776
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:52,200
- Sorry, darling.
- Stop it, Dil.

777
01:08:52,325 --> 01:08:54,327
Apologies, my sweet.

778
01:08:57,538 --> 01:09:00,708
That's more like it, dear.
Have a cuppa.

779
01:09:07,423 --> 01:09:09,801
You're somethin' else, Dil.
You know that?

780
01:09:09,926 --> 01:09:12,345
Never said a truer word.

781
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:14,889
I was always best
lookin' after someone.

782
01:09:14,973 --> 01:09:18,309
- Must be something in the genes.
- Must be.

783
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:20,603
And the fact that
you didn't know...

784
01:09:20,687 --> 01:09:22,605
is basically the fault
of yours truly.

785
01:09:22,689 --> 01:09:26,901
And even when you were throwin' up,
I could tell you cared.

786
01:09:27,026 --> 01:09:31,197
- You could?
- Do you care, Jimmy?

787
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,158
Yeah. Sure I do.

788
01:09:34,283 --> 01:09:37,078
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

789
01:09:37,161 --> 01:09:39,038
I care, Dil.

790
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:44,669
Are you crying?

791
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:54,220
I'm tired and emotional.

792
01:09:55,763 --> 01:09:59,350
- Do it on your own time, Pat.
- What?

793
01:09:59,475 --> 01:10:01,519
Whatever it is
she does for you.

794
01:10:01,602 --> 01:10:03,563
If I was her,
I'd consider that an insult.

795
01:10:03,688 --> 01:10:08,401
Consider it how you like.
Just get the bloody tart out of here!

796
01:10:10,445 --> 01:10:13,740
Didja ever pick your teeth up
with broken fingers?

797
01:10:15,533 --> 01:10:18,786
- What's that supposed to mean?
- A simple question.

798
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:27,128
- Come on, dear.
- He didn't answer, honey.

799
01:10:29,756 --> 01:10:32,967
Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.

800
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:35,928
- My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
- Shut up.

801
01:10:36,054 --> 01:10:38,890
- Made me feel all funny inside.
- I said stop it.

802
01:10:39,015 --> 01:10:41,726
Ask to meet me again, Jimmy.

803
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:45,897
- Do you think that's wise?
- Nothing's wise.

804
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:50,401
- I didn't mean to hit you.
- I know that.

805
01:10:50,485 --> 01:10:54,155
- I kinda liked you as a girl.
- That's a start.

806
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,325
- So, I'm sorry.
- So, make it up to me, then.

807
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,994
- How?
- Ask to meet me again.

808
01:11:02,372 --> 01:11:05,959
- Will you meet me again?
- When?

809
01:11:06,084 --> 01:11:08,586
Whenever.

810
01:11:08,711 --> 01:11:10,546
Tonight.

811
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:26,354
- Good night.
- See ya later.

812
01:11:28,272 --> 01:11:30,483
- Do they know?
- Know what, honey?

813
01:11:30,608 --> 01:11:32,110
Know what I didn't know...

814
01:11:32,235 --> 01:11:34,195
- And don't call me that.
- Can't help it.

815
01:11:34,278 --> 01:11:37,323
- A girl has her feelings.
- Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.

816
01:11:37,407 --> 01:11:40,034
- Details, baby, details.
- So they do know.

817
01:11:41,452 --> 01:11:44,122
- All right, they do.
- Don't.

818
01:11:45,999 --> 01:11:48,626
- I shoulda known, shouldn't I?
- Probably.

819
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:52,255
- Kinda wish I didn't.
- You can always pretend.

820
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,340
That's true.

821
01:11:56,009 --> 01:11:57,927
Your soldier knew, didn't he?

822
01:11:58,011 --> 01:12:00,805
Absolutely.

823
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:03,641
Won't be quite the same,
though, will it?

824
01:12:03,766 --> 01:12:05,476
Are you pretendin' yet?

825
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,478
I'm workin' on it.

826
01:12:10,273 --> 01:12:12,317
There's Dave.

827
01:12:12,442 --> 01:12:15,236
- He knew too.
- Stop it, Jimmy.

828
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:18,573
Am I becoming repetitious?

829
01:12:18,656 --> 01:12:20,575
- A little.
- Sorry.

830
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:25,580
- No, don't ask me in.
- Please, Jimmy.

831
01:12:25,663 --> 01:12:29,959
No. Can't pretend that much.

832
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:32,754
- I miss you, Jimmy.
- Yeah?

833
01:12:32,879 --> 01:12:35,798
- Shoulda stayed a girl.
- Don't be cruel.

834
01:12:38,635 --> 01:12:41,429
Okay.

835
01:12:41,512 --> 01:12:43,640
Be a good girl. Go inside.

836
01:12:45,266 --> 01:12:47,352
Only if you kiss me.

837
01:12:58,905 --> 01:13:02,283
- Now are you happy?
- Delirious.

838
01:13:14,837 --> 01:13:16,756
Hello, stranger.

839
01:13:18,508 --> 01:13:20,385
You vanished.

840
01:13:22,303 --> 01:13:24,722
What was it, Fergus?
Did you blow the gaff on us...

841
01:13:24,806 --> 01:13:27,225
or did you just fuck up?

842
01:13:28,393 --> 01:13:30,895
Leave me alone, Jude.

843
01:13:30,979 --> 01:13:33,564
No. That's the last thing
I'll do.

844
01:13:43,032 --> 01:13:46,244
- You never asked what happened.
- I heard.

845
01:13:46,369 --> 01:13:49,664
- Eddie and Tinker died.
- I know.

846
01:13:49,747 --> 01:13:52,208
Maguire and me got out
by the skin of our teeth...

847
01:13:52,292 --> 01:13:53,751
No thanks to you.

848
01:13:56,504 --> 01:13:59,173
What do you think of my hair?

849
01:13:59,257 --> 01:14:01,884
- Suits you.
- Aye.

850
01:14:01,968 --> 01:14:05,596
I was sick of bein' a blonde.

851
01:14:05,722 --> 01:14:09,225
I needed a tougher look,
if you know what I mean.

852
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:22,071
Fuck me, Fergus.

853
01:14:25,158 --> 01:14:27,702
Am I to take it that's a no?

854
01:14:30,622 --> 01:14:33,916
We had a court-martial
in your absence.

855
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:36,127
They wanted to put
a bullet through your head.

856
01:14:36,252 --> 01:14:38,338
I pleaded for clemency.

857
01:14:38,421 --> 01:14:42,592
Said we should find out
what happened first.

858
01:14:42,675 --> 01:14:44,594
So what did happen?

859
01:14:45,803 --> 01:14:47,680
He ran.

860
01:14:47,805 --> 01:14:50,642
I couldn't shoot him
in the back.

861
01:14:50,725 --> 01:14:53,603
Tried to catch him.

862
01:14:53,686 --> 01:14:57,815
He made it to the road
and got hit by a Saracen.

863
01:14:57,899 --> 01:15:02,153
- So you did fuck up.
- Yes.

864
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:05,573
But you know what
the thing is, Fergus?

865
01:15:05,657 --> 01:15:07,700
No. What is the thing?

866
01:15:07,825 --> 01:15:11,412
You vanished quite effectively.

867
01:15:11,496 --> 01:15:13,623
Became Mister Nobody.

868
01:15:13,748 --> 01:15:16,918
You've no idea
how useful that could be.

869
01:15:17,001 --> 01:15:20,254
- What do you mean?
- We've got some plans here...

870
01:15:20,338 --> 01:15:23,841
and we'll need a Mister Nobody
to execute them.

871
01:15:23,967 --> 01:15:26,469
No way, Jude. I'm out.

872
01:15:26,594 --> 01:15:29,555
You're never out, Fergus.

873
01:15:31,182 --> 01:15:34,477
Maybe you don't care
about yourself, but...

874
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,771
Consider the girl, Fergus.

875
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,900
The wee black chick.

876
01:15:41,025 --> 01:15:43,695
- Leave her out of this!
- Jesus, Fergus!

877
01:15:43,778 --> 01:15:45,488
You're a walkin' cliche.

878
01:15:45,613 --> 01:15:48,992
You know we won't
leave her out of it.

879
01:15:49,117 --> 01:15:52,787
But I'm glad to see you care.

880
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:55,456
And, I must admit...

881
01:15:55,581 --> 01:15:58,293
- I'm curious.
- What the fuck do you know, Jude?

882
01:15:58,376 --> 01:16:00,503
You fuckin' tell me, boy!

883
01:16:02,297 --> 01:16:05,925
She's nobody. She likes me.

884
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:09,345
So I suppose a fuck
is out of the question.

885
01:16:10,972 --> 01:16:14,183
You keep your head down,
Fergus.

886
01:16:14,267 --> 01:16:16,477
No sudden moves.

887
01:16:16,602 --> 01:16:19,564
And not a whisper to her.

888
01:16:19,689 --> 01:16:21,607
You'll be hearin' from us.

889
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,697
Keep the faith.

890
01:16:47,592 --> 01:16:49,552
He your boyfriend?

891
01:16:53,097 --> 01:16:54,974
Lucky you.

892
01:16:58,978 --> 01:17:00,813
Carnations.

893
01:17:00,897 --> 01:17:03,816
- What?
- He'd bring me carnations.

894
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:07,153
- So I got it wrong?
- Not at all, honey.

895
01:17:07,278 --> 01:17:09,447
- Don't.
- Okay.

896
01:17:15,495 --> 01:17:18,164
- Come on. Come on.
- Why, honey?

897
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:20,959
- Gonna tell me why?
- No.

898
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:25,630
What's wrong, Jimmy?

899
01:17:25,755 --> 01:17:27,924
- You gonna tell me what's wrong?
- No. Not here.

900
01:17:40,061 --> 01:17:41,980
You gonna tell me what it is?

901
01:17:42,063 --> 01:17:45,108
- What is it?
- You know her, Jimmy?

902
01:17:45,191 --> 01:17:48,069
Jimmy, is it?
You know me, Jimmy?

903
01:17:48,194 --> 01:17:50,571
- Dil, this is Jude.
- You following me?

904
01:17:50,655 --> 01:17:53,116
Yeah! Just checkin'.

905
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:57,245
- Has he been nice to you, Dil?
- Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?

906
01:17:57,370 --> 01:18:01,374
That's good. I'm glad.

907
01:18:01,457 --> 01:18:06,087
- Young love, as they say.
- Absolutely. The younger the better.

908
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:09,966
- Doesn't come much your way, I suppose.
- Don't go lookin' for it, Dil.

909
01:18:10,049 --> 01:18:13,136
Well, maybe you'll
get lucky someday.

910
01:18:13,261 --> 01:18:15,930
Bit heavy on the powder,
isn't she, Jimmy?

911
01:18:16,014 --> 01:18:20,310
- A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
- Oh, absolutely.

912
01:18:20,393 --> 01:18:23,021
As long as she can keep it.

913
01:18:23,104 --> 01:18:25,857
Isn't that right, James?

914
01:18:34,657 --> 01:18:37,952
- It's her, isn't it?
- What's her?

915
01:18:38,077 --> 01:18:41,122
She's the thing
you had to tell me.

916
01:18:41,247 --> 01:18:43,499
Kind of.

917
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:47,545
I'm sorry, you know that?
I'm really sorry.

918
01:18:49,464 --> 01:18:52,717
- You see that, Col?
- Saw it, Dil.

919
01:18:52,842 --> 01:18:55,720
- "Fuck it" is what I say.
- Yeah, fuck it.

920
01:18:55,845 --> 01:18:59,140
- Fuckin' men, Col.
- Fuck 'em.

921
01:19:00,266 --> 01:19:02,393
Fuck you, Jimmy!

922
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,459
- You could always make it up to her.
- How?

923
01:19:26,584 --> 01:19:28,086
When a girl runs out
like that...

924
01:19:28,211 --> 01:19:29,671
she generally
wants to be followed.

925
01:19:31,172 --> 01:19:32,799
She's not a girl, Col.

926
01:19:32,882 --> 01:19:35,551
Whatever you say.

927
01:19:49,023 --> 01:19:52,819
She went that way,
but you go with me.

928
01:20:22,181 --> 01:20:24,976
So, it was you all the time.

929
01:20:25,059 --> 01:20:28,479
- Who'd you think it was?
- I thought it was Dave.

930
01:20:29,856 --> 01:20:32,442
And who's Dave
when he's at home?

931
01:20:32,567 --> 01:20:35,194
He's at home.

932
01:20:35,278 --> 01:20:38,281
- Should blow you away, you know that.
- Yeah, I know.

933
01:20:40,408 --> 01:20:43,008
I'm gettin' emotional, and I don't like
gettin' fuckin' emotional!

934
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:45,997
You understand, Hennessy?

935
01:20:46,122 --> 01:20:48,249
- Yeah. I understand.
- Fuck you too.

936
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:50,251
Fuck you.

937
01:20:50,335 --> 01:20:52,629
Leave him alone, Peter.

938
01:20:52,754 --> 01:20:56,883
- He's in love.
- That right, Fergus? You in love?

939
01:20:56,966 --> 01:20:59,594
- Absolutely.
- What's she like between the sheets?

940
01:20:59,677 --> 01:21:02,847
- Definitely unusual.
- And who is she?

941
01:21:02,972 --> 01:21:05,683
Just a girl.

942
01:21:05,808 --> 01:21:09,395
You know what'll happen
if you fuck up again, don't ya?

943
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,024
- Yeah, I do, Peter.
- Good.

944
01:21:25,578 --> 01:21:27,747
So, what do you think
that is, Hennessy?

945
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:28,957
A hotel?

946
01:21:31,376 --> 01:21:34,921
It's a knockin' shop.
Tres discreet?

947
01:21:36,005 --> 01:21:38,257
He visits his ladies
Tuesdays and Thursday nights...

948
01:21:38,341 --> 01:21:39,634
and Saturday mornings.

949
01:21:39,717 --> 01:21:41,469
That's his security
in the car beyond.

950
01:21:45,473 --> 01:21:46,516
Who is he?

951
01:21:46,599 --> 01:21:49,018
Doesn't matter who he is.
He's a legitimate target.

952
01:21:49,102 --> 01:21:50,395
Thank God for that.

953
01:21:51,729 --> 01:21:54,565
- You tryin' to be cynical, Hennessy?
- Hope not.

954
01:21:54,649 --> 01:21:55,858
Good.

955
01:21:55,984 --> 01:21:58,861
So, what do you think?

956
01:22:03,616 --> 01:22:07,078
Whoever hits him will be hit,
if those men are any good.

957
01:22:09,205 --> 01:22:12,250
- And I presume you can't get inside.
- Right.

958
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:15,920
- So it's on the street?
- Right.

959
01:22:16,045 --> 01:22:17,922
Kind of suicide, isn't it?

960
01:22:19,882 --> 01:22:22,593
But then,
I don't have a choice.

961
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:25,638
Oh, you do, Fergie.

962
01:22:25,763 --> 01:22:28,266
Of course.

963
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:30,435
I forgot.

964
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:33,062
Come on.

965
01:22:33,146 --> 01:22:35,064
Rehearsal.

966
01:22:46,576 --> 01:22:49,704
You keep your mind
on your job, boy.

967
01:22:49,787 --> 01:22:52,874
- Then you'll leave her out of it?
- Aye. Then we'll leave her be.

968
01:22:57,462 --> 01:23:02,342
He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes
to get to the door.

969
01:23:03,968 --> 01:23:07,847
- And what if I say no?
- You know what. Go.

970
01:23:26,908 --> 01:23:28,910
Pardon me, young man!

971
01:23:39,963 --> 01:23:41,839
- You were made for this.
- Was I?

972
01:23:41,965 --> 01:23:44,342
- Perfect!
- What happens then?

973
01:23:44,467 --> 01:23:45,802
We'll be on the other side.

974
01:23:45,927 --> 01:23:48,638
- We'll move when you do.
- And what if you don't?

975
01:23:48,763 --> 01:23:52,058
- Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
- You may be right.

976
01:23:53,726 --> 01:23:58,189
Stay late at your work tomorrow night
and I'll bring you the gear.

977
01:23:58,272 --> 01:24:00,858
- Jude.
- Yes?

978
01:24:00,984 --> 01:24:02,902
Who is the old geezer?

979
01:24:04,278 --> 01:24:06,155
Some judge.

980
01:24:20,503 --> 01:24:23,506
- Why'd you follow me, Dil?
- I was jealous, Jimmy.

981
01:24:23,589 --> 01:24:27,343
- You shouldn't be.
- Why shouldn't I be jealous?

982
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:31,222
Don't. My makeup.

983
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:42,984
- She own you, Jimmy?
- Yes.

984
01:24:43,109 --> 01:24:47,488
- She's from Scotland too?
- Yeah, you could say that.

985
01:24:47,613 --> 01:24:51,743
- And you're not gonna tell me more?
- Can't.

986
01:25:01,336 --> 01:25:03,296
What you doing, Jimmy?

987
01:25:06,382 --> 01:25:08,635
I don't know yet.

988
01:25:10,845 --> 01:25:13,389
Do you like me
even a little bit?

989
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,479
More than that.

990
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:25,151
Come on. Let's go for a walk.

991
01:25:26,778 --> 01:25:30,698
- Do something for me, Dil?
- Anything.

992
01:25:30,823 --> 01:25:33,284
You'd do anything for me?

993
01:25:33,409 --> 01:25:35,286
I'm afraid so.

994
01:25:35,411 --> 01:25:37,872
You got the keys to the shop?

995
01:25:49,342 --> 01:25:52,387
Want another haircut, Jimmy?

996
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:55,264
No. Come on, sit down.

997
01:26:03,147 --> 01:26:07,652
- You'd do anything for me?
- Anything.

998
01:26:09,112 --> 01:26:12,198
- No way.
- You said anything, Dil.

999
01:26:12,282 --> 01:26:14,993
A girl has to
draw the line somewhere.

1000
01:26:16,327 --> 01:26:20,123
- Want to change you to a man.
- Why?

1001
01:26:20,206 --> 01:26:22,917
It's a secret.

1002
01:26:23,001 --> 01:26:26,129
Would you like me
better that way, Jimmy?

1003
01:26:26,254 --> 01:26:27,422
Yes.

1004
01:26:27,547 --> 01:26:29,757
- And you wouldn't leave me?
- No.

1005
01:26:29,841 --> 01:26:32,302
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

1006
01:26:35,221 --> 01:26:37,223
Go on, then.

1007
01:26:59,203 --> 01:27:03,207
- You want to make me like him?
- No.

1008
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:06,294
I want to make you
into something new...

1009
01:27:06,377 --> 01:27:09,464
that nobody recognizes.

1010
01:27:22,518 --> 01:27:25,063
I don't recognize myself.

1011
01:27:28,441 --> 01:27:31,903
No. Better in the dark.

1012
01:27:31,986 --> 01:27:34,322
- So it's true, then.
- What?

1013
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:37,742
- You like me better like this.
- Yes.

1014
01:27:50,046 --> 01:27:52,715
No, no. Dil. Dil. Come on.

1015
01:27:54,217 --> 01:27:56,094
Dil.

1016
01:28:12,318 --> 01:28:14,278
Turn around. Turn around.

1017
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:22,578
Baby.

1018
01:28:27,458 --> 01:28:29,460
What you doin', honey?

1019
01:28:29,585 --> 01:28:32,797
- Don't call me that.
- Sorry.

1020
01:28:32,922 --> 01:28:36,009
- What you doin'?
- Try this on.

1021
01:28:36,092 --> 01:28:39,137
- Why?
- For me.

1022
01:28:39,262 --> 01:28:41,389
- For you.
- Yes.

1023
01:28:48,855 --> 01:28:51,983
- What we doin' here, Jimmy?
- Look on it like a honeymoon.

1024
01:30:04,555 --> 01:30:06,432
You a handyman, Fergie?

1025
01:30:06,557 --> 01:30:09,686
Take a pride in my work.

1026
01:30:09,769 --> 01:30:12,105
I sincerely hope so.

1027
01:30:29,831 --> 01:30:31,708
Tools of the trade, now.

1028
01:30:38,298 --> 01:30:40,341
And forget about the girl.

1029
01:30:52,353 --> 01:30:54,272
Dil!

1030
01:31:04,657 --> 01:31:06,534
Dil!

1031
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:10,872
Dil!

1032
01:31:10,997 --> 01:31:13,082
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1033
01:31:13,207 --> 01:31:15,918
- I'm goin' home!
- I told you to stay in the hotel!

1034
01:31:16,002 --> 01:31:17,879
I thought you was foolin' me.

1035
01:31:17,962 --> 01:31:20,340
- I thought you were leavin' me!
- I had to go to work!

1036
01:31:20,423 --> 01:31:24,135
I stayed all day in the hotel
thinkin' every noise was you!

1037
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:25,345
Come on.

1038
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:27,180
There's something you're
not telling me, Jimmy.

1039
01:31:27,305 --> 01:31:31,434
- Come on!
- No! I'm goin' home.

1040
01:31:31,517 --> 01:31:34,562
- Dil!
- So tell me!

1041
01:31:34,687 --> 01:31:36,731
I was tryin' to get out
of something!

1042
01:31:36,856 --> 01:31:40,068
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy!

1043
01:31:40,193 --> 01:31:43,780
You... You gotta forget
you ever saw me, Dil.

1044
01:31:43,905 --> 01:31:45,782
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1045
01:31:47,241 --> 01:31:50,119
Stop it, would ya?

1046
01:31:50,244 --> 01:31:52,664
Give it over, Dil,
for fuck's sake!

1047
01:31:56,042 --> 01:32:01,339
I'm sorry. I get nervous.
I've got this blood condition.

1048
01:32:01,464 --> 01:32:05,093
Just help me inside, Jimmy,
and I'll be all right.

1049
01:32:18,231 --> 01:32:20,608
Did you hear what I said, Dil?

1050
01:32:32,954 --> 01:32:34,831
Get my pills.

1051
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:40,712
- What pills?
- Prescription for my condition.

1052
01:32:40,837 --> 01:32:42,588
What condition?

1053
01:32:42,672 --> 01:32:45,800
My condition. Ennui.

1054
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:58,688
Are you supposed
to take that many?

1055
01:32:58,771 --> 01:33:01,316
Only in times
of extreme stress.

1056
01:33:06,112 --> 01:33:08,990
See, they all say
good-bye sometime.

1057
01:33:09,115 --> 01:33:10,992
Except for him.

1058
01:33:11,117 --> 01:33:12,994
Are you all right, Dil?

1059
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:15,121
I will be.

1060
01:33:16,831 --> 01:33:19,417
Go on.

1061
01:33:19,542 --> 01:33:21,711
Good-bye, Dil.

1062
01:33:26,049 --> 01:33:30,303
- Jimmy.
- What?

1063
01:33:30,428 --> 01:33:32,388
Don't go like that.

1064
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:37,310
Can't help what I am.

1065
01:33:55,411 --> 01:33:57,413
I knew you had a heart.

1066
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:06,422
Dil, can I tell you somethin'?

1067
01:34:06,547 --> 01:34:09,384
I knew your man.

1068
01:34:09,467 --> 01:34:11,719
You knew which man?

1069
01:34:11,803 --> 01:34:15,181
- Your soldier.
- You knew my Jody?

1070
01:34:17,058 --> 01:34:21,062
Lifted him from a carnival
outside Belfast.

1071
01:34:21,187 --> 01:34:24,440
Held him hostage
for three days.

1072
01:34:24,524 --> 01:34:26,859
You knew my Jody?

1073
01:34:26,943 --> 01:34:29,445
- Are you listenin'?
- Yes.

1074
01:34:31,906 --> 01:34:33,783
Got the order to shoot him.

1075
01:34:35,493 --> 01:34:39,038
Before I could do it, he ran.

1076
01:34:39,122 --> 01:34:41,624
Ran into a tank and died.

1077
01:34:41,749 --> 01:34:44,752
- Died?
- Did you hear me?

1078
01:34:44,836 --> 01:34:49,132
- You killed my Jody?
- In a manner of speakin'.

1079
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:54,971
- It was you.
- You should scream.

1080
01:34:55,096 --> 01:34:57,557
You should beat my head off.

1081
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:06,691
- You killed my Jody.
- No.

1082
01:35:08,234 --> 01:35:10,737
You didn't?

1083
01:35:10,862 --> 01:35:14,490
- I suppose I tried.
- Tried.

1084
01:35:14,616 --> 01:35:16,618
Don't you want to kill me?

1085
01:35:20,204 --> 01:35:22,248
Bang.

1086
01:35:28,671 --> 01:35:31,549
Don't leave me tonight.

1087
01:35:31,674 --> 01:35:33,676
Might kill me too.

1088
01:35:35,386 --> 01:35:37,472
Okay.

1089
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:49,836
What the fuck?

1090
01:36:49,961 --> 01:36:52,797
So, tell me what
you're doing, Jimmy.

1091
01:37:18,615 --> 01:37:21,075
Didn't really listen
last night.

1092
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,953
I heard, but I didn't listen.

1093
01:37:24,078 --> 01:37:26,289
Dil.

1094
01:37:26,414 --> 01:37:28,416
That won't do you no good.

1095
01:37:28,499 --> 01:37:30,501
Dil knows how to tie a body.

1096
01:37:34,714 --> 01:37:38,134
I wondered why you came on
to me like that...

1097
01:37:38,217 --> 01:37:42,096
- when you gave me the look.
- He asked me to see were you all right!

1098
01:37:57,278 --> 01:38:01,240
See, I fix on anyone
who's nice to me.

1099
01:38:01,324 --> 01:38:04,369
Just the littlest bit nice
and I'm yours.

1100
01:38:04,494 --> 01:38:06,371
Stop it, Dil!

1101
01:38:06,496 --> 01:38:09,958
Just don't kick Dil
and she'll be touched.

1102
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:12,835
Be nice to her
and she'll be yours forever.

1103
01:38:16,422 --> 01:38:19,926
See, I should
blow you away, Jimmy.

1104
01:38:20,051 --> 01:38:23,346
But I can't... yet.

1105
01:38:23,429 --> 01:38:25,348
- Let me go, Dil.
- Why?

1106
01:38:25,431 --> 01:38:29,560
- I gotta be somewhere!
- So try and go then.

1107
01:38:36,234 --> 01:38:38,111
Where the fuck is he?

1108
01:38:38,236 --> 01:38:40,154
Christ.

1109
01:38:41,739 --> 01:38:44,534
Let me go,
for fuck's sake, Dil...

1110
01:38:44,659 --> 01:38:48,204
- or they'll be here.
- Let them come, then.

1111
01:38:48,329 --> 01:38:49,956
Can't stay here, Peter.

1112
01:38:50,039 --> 01:38:52,667
- Drive around once more.
- Bollocks.

1113
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:55,503
See, I just want
your company...

1114
01:38:55,586 --> 01:38:57,797
for a little while longer.

1115
01:39:05,096 --> 01:39:08,558
- That fucker's dead.
- No, we are.

1116
01:39:08,641 --> 01:39:11,853
You don't know
what you're doin', Dil.

1117
01:39:11,978 --> 01:39:13,855
Never did.

1118
01:39:23,031 --> 01:39:27,201
- Shit. Give me the shooter.
- What? You're crazy!

1119
01:39:27,327 --> 01:39:30,622
- Give me the fuckin' shooter, Jude!
- Peter!

1120
01:39:31,831 --> 01:39:34,083
Peter!

1121
01:40:23,591 --> 01:40:27,595
I know all there is to know

1122
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:31,224
About the crying game

1123
01:40:34,852 --> 01:40:38,731
- I've had my share
- You like me now, Jimmy?

1124
01:40:38,815 --> 01:40:42,318
- Of the crying game...
- Yeah, I like you, Dil.

1125
01:40:42,443 --> 01:40:45,613
Give me a bit more, baby.
A bit more.

1126
01:40:45,738 --> 01:40:48,741
- More what?
- More endearments.

1127
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:53,288
- I like you, Dil.
- Love me.

1128
01:40:53,413 --> 01:40:56,708
- Yeah.
- Tell me you love me.

1129
01:40:56,833 --> 01:41:00,795
- Whatever you say, Dil.
- Then say it.

1130
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:03,840
I love you, Dil.

1131
01:41:03,923 --> 01:41:05,842
You do?

1132
01:41:05,925 --> 01:41:09,429
- One day soon I'm gonna tell the moon
- Yeah.

1133
01:41:09,554 --> 01:41:13,349
- About the crying game
- What would you do for me?

1134
01:41:15,059 --> 01:41:16,936
Anything.

1135
01:41:17,061 --> 01:41:20,106
- And if he knows
- Say it again.

1136
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:23,943
- Maybe he'll explain
- I'd do anything for ya, Dil.

1137
01:41:27,822 --> 01:41:30,241
Why there are heartaches

1138
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:38,082
Why there are tears

1139
01:41:38,207 --> 01:41:42,086
- You'd never leave me?
- And what to do to stop feelin' blue

1140
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:44,797
- Never.
- When love disappears

1141
01:41:44,881 --> 01:41:48,468
I know you're lying, Jimmy,
but it's nice to hear it.

1142
01:41:54,098 --> 01:41:56,768
I'm sorry.

1143
01:42:04,734 --> 01:42:07,946
You stupid shit!

1144
01:42:08,029 --> 01:42:10,531
Once was bad enough, but twice?

1145
01:42:10,657 --> 01:42:12,659
You didn't knock, honey.

1146
01:42:14,911 --> 01:42:17,664
- Dil!
- Get that thing off me, Fergus!

1147
01:42:17,747 --> 01:42:19,147
What was that
she called you, Jimmy?

1148
01:42:19,165 --> 01:42:22,418
- Fergus! It's my name, Dil!
- What's Fergus?

1149
01:42:22,502 --> 01:42:25,546
- What happened to Jimmy?
- I said get her off!

1150
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:26,923
What's she gonna do, Jimmy?

1151
01:42:27,048 --> 01:42:29,133
- She gonna blow you away?
- Dil!

1152
01:42:29,258 --> 01:42:30,760
- Dil!
- Was she there too...

1153
01:42:30,885 --> 01:42:31,970
when you got my Jody?

1154
01:42:32,095 --> 01:42:34,097
- Dil!
- I asked you a question.

1155
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:36,015
Were you there too?

1156
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:38,977
You sick bitch.

1157
01:42:39,102 --> 01:42:40,895
- Dil!
- You was there, wasn't you?

1158
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:43,272
You used those tits and that ass
to get him, didn't you?

1159
01:42:50,655 --> 01:42:55,576
- She was there, wasn't she?
- She was.

1160
01:42:57,704 --> 01:43:01,624
She used her tits and that cute
little ass to get him, didn't she?

1161
01:43:02,959 --> 01:43:04,460
Yes.

1162
01:43:04,544 --> 01:43:07,630
Tell me what she wore.

1163
01:43:09,841 --> 01:43:11,801
Can't remember.

1164
01:43:23,354 --> 01:43:25,231
I can't do it, Jimmy.

1165
01:43:27,317 --> 01:43:29,235
He won't let me.

1166
01:43:38,995 --> 01:43:41,372
You won't let me, Jody.

1167
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:07,398
You've got to go now, Dil.

1168
01:44:07,523 --> 01:44:10,568
- Do I?
- Yes.

1169
01:44:10,693 --> 01:44:12,278
Now.

1170
01:44:12,403 --> 01:44:15,949
- Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
- Not if you go.

1171
01:44:16,074 --> 01:44:18,618
- Will I see you again?
- Yes.

1172
01:44:18,743 --> 01:44:20,662
- Promise?
- Promise.

1173
01:44:23,122 --> 01:44:26,417
- Where am I to go, Jimmy?
- The Metro.

1174
01:44:27,877 --> 01:44:30,046
- And meet Col.
- Yeah.

1175
01:44:30,171 --> 01:44:32,131
Say hello to Col.

1176
01:45:19,512 --> 01:45:21,472
You shoulda stayed at home.

1177
01:46:15,109 --> 01:46:17,737
I got the multivitamins
and the iron tablets, hon.

1178
01:46:17,862 --> 01:46:20,406
- Don't call me that.
- Sorry, love.

1179
01:46:20,531 --> 01:46:22,492
- The white one's magnesium supplement.
- Stop it, Dil.

1180
01:46:22,617 --> 01:46:27,121
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy.
I'm counting the days.

1181
01:46:27,246 --> 01:46:30,083
Two thousand, three hundred
and thirty-four left.

1182
01:46:30,166 --> 01:46:32,752
- Thirty-five.
- I'm sorry, darlin'.

1183
01:46:32,877 --> 01:46:34,712
I keep forgetting
the leap year.

1184
01:46:34,837 --> 01:46:35,880
Dil.

1185
01:46:36,005 --> 01:46:37,465
What am I supposed to
call you then, Jimmy?

1186
01:46:37,548 --> 01:46:40,134
- Fergus.
- Fergus.

1187
01:46:42,095 --> 01:46:46,391
Fergus. My love.
Light of my life.

1188
01:46:46,516 --> 01:46:49,519
- Please, Dil.
- Can't help it.

1189
01:46:49,602 --> 01:46:51,270
You're doing time for me.

1190
01:46:51,396 --> 01:46:54,941
No greater love,
as the man says.

1191
01:46:55,066 --> 01:46:56,943
I wish you'd tell me why.

1192
01:46:57,068 --> 01:47:00,571
As a man said,
it's in my nature.

1193
01:47:00,655 --> 01:47:02,615
What's that supposed to mean?

1194
01:47:03,658 --> 01:47:04,993
Well...

1195
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:08,288
there's this scorpion,
you see...

1196
01:47:08,371 --> 01:47:09,914
and he wants to go
across a river.

1197
01:47:10,039 --> 01:47:13,209
Well, he can't swim, so...

1198
01:47:13,334 --> 01:47:15,920
he goes to this frog,
who naturally enough can swim,

1199
01:47:16,045 --> 01:47:18,506
and he says...

1200
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:20,049
"Excuse me, Mr. Froggy.

1201
01:47:20,174 --> 01:47:24,178
- Sometimes it's hard to be
- "I want to go across the river."

1202
01:47:24,262 --> 01:47:26,180
A woman

1203
01:47:26,264 --> 01:47:28,474
So the frog accepts the idea.

1204
01:47:28,599 --> 01:47:34,105
- Scorpion hops on the frog's back.
- Givin' all your love to just one man

1205
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:38,026
Suddenly, the frog... "Aah!"
He feels this sting!

1206
01:47:38,151 --> 01:47:42,864
- You'll have bad times
- "You stung me!"

1207
01:47:42,989 --> 01:47:46,659
- He'll have good times
- "Why did you go and do that?"

1208
01:47:46,743 --> 01:47:49,579
- The scorpion looks at him and says...
- Doin' things that you don't

1209
01:47:49,704 --> 01:47:51,581
Understand

1210
01:47:51,706 --> 01:47:55,793
"I can't help it.
It's in my nature."

1211
01:47:55,918 --> 01:47:58,546
But if you love him

1212
01:47:58,671 --> 01:48:02,133
You'll forgive him

1213
01:48:05,136 --> 01:48:10,850
Even though he's hard
to understand

1214
01:48:14,145 --> 01:48:18,232
And if you love him

1215
01:48:18,358 --> 01:48:23,529
Oh, be proud of him

1216
01:48:23,655 --> 01:48:28,451
'Cause after all
he's just a man

1217
01:48:31,955 --> 01:48:36,417
Stand by your man

1218
01:48:36,542 --> 01:48:41,005
And show the world you love him

1219
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:49,130
Keep givin'
all the love you can

1220
01:48:50,473 --> 01:48:58,473
Stand by your man

1221
01:49:26,676 --> 01:49:30,513
I know all there is to know

1222
01:49:30,596 --> 01:49:33,391
About the crying game

1223
01:49:36,769 --> 01:49:40,231
I've had my share

1224
01:49:40,356 --> 01:49:43,401
Of the crying game

1225
01:49:46,904 --> 01:49:51,659
First there are kisses

1226
01:49:51,784 --> 01:49:55,330
Then there are sighs

1227
01:49:55,413 --> 01:49:59,709
And then before
you know where you are

1228
01:49:59,792 --> 01:50:03,588
You're sayin' good-bye

1229
01:50:07,258 --> 01:50:11,220
One day soon
I'm gonna tell the moon

1230
01:50:11,304 --> 01:50:14,599
About the crying game

1231
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:25,985
And if he knows

1232
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:29,238
Maybe he'll explain

1233
01:50:32,659 --> 01:50:37,372
- Why there are heartaches
- Heartaches

1234
01:50:37,455 --> 01:50:41,084
- Why there are tears
- So sad

1235
01:50:41,209 --> 01:50:45,421
And what to do
to stop feelin' blue

1236
01:50:45,546 --> 01:50:48,883
When love disappears

1237
01:51:10,989 --> 01:51:15,660
- First there are kisses
- Kisses

1238
01:51:15,743 --> 01:51:19,497
- Then there are sighs
- So sad

1239
01:51:19,622 --> 01:51:23,793
And then before
you know where you are

1240
01:51:23,918 --> 01:51:27,630
You're sayin' good-bye

1241
01:51:28,965 --> 01:51:31,342
Don't want no more

1242
01:51:33,177 --> 01:51:35,805
Of the crying game

1243
01:51:37,265 --> 01:51:40,810
- Don't want no more
- Don't want no more

1244
01:51:42,937 --> 01:51:46,899
Of the crying game

1245
01:51:48,568 --> 01:51:52,572
Don't want no more

1246
01:51:52,655 --> 01:51:54,991
Of the crying game
