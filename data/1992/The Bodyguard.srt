1
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,470
Stay down.

2
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,180
Freeze! Just freeze.

3
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,730
Your hands ever shake, Frank?

4
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,470
Sometimes.

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,130
It's just adrenaline.

6
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,470
Of course.

7
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,380
How did you know?

8
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,150
-I saw him washing the car.
-So did I.

9
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,650
They don't wash cars
on the parking levels.

10
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,330
Frank...

11
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,400
...I'd like you to stay on.

12
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,260
I'm no good in a permanent position.

13
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,570
My feet go to sleep.

14
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,850
You're turning down $2,000 a week?

15
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,420
So you won't protect Rachel Marron
because she's in show business?

16
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,160
I don't do celebrities.

17
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,760
2500.

18
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,170
There's many good men for that much.

19
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,670
Have you talked to...

20
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,930
...Racine, Fitzgerald...

21
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,670
...Portman?

22
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,440
Portman's interested.

23
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,370
But we heard you were the best.

24
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,950
There's no such thing.

25
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,950
We're talking about a very frightened
lady with an 8-year-old son.

26
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,020
I wouldn't be here if I
didn't think this was real.

27
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,790
Farmer, she begged me to get you.

28
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,130
Please.

29
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,520
Okay, I'll come.

30
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,630
I'll look the situation over.

31
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,800
If I take it...

32
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,040
...it's 3000 a week.

33
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,910
You must be very deadly
for 3 grand a week.

34
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,210
Watch and see.

35
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,040
Shit.

36
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,660
It's something.

37
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,190
Sorry.

38
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,230
Don't stand there, either.

39
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,790
Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.

40
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,720
What?

41
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,220
Alexander Graham Bell
to see Miss Marron.

42
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,790
Got an appointment?

43
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,570
The atomic number of zinc is thirty.

44
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,400
All right.

45
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,970
Can I help you?

46
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,210
You the man on the intercom?

47
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,220
Can I help you?

48
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,720
My name's Edison.
I have an appointment.

49
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,090
Arranged by...?

50
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,060
Mr. Devaney.

51
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,220
Go right ahead, Mr. Edison.

52
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,890
What happened?

53
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,100
A doll.

54
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,220
Henry Ford to see Mr. Devaney.

55
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,650
Who?

56
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,050
Henry Ford.

57
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,980
Come in.

58
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,790
Playback, everybody.

59
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,070
That's what I want.

60
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,310
Glad you came. Come on.
I'll introduce you to Rachel.

61
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,570
I bet you loved it.

62
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,080
-He doesn't know great art.
-Frank Farmer's here.

63
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,980
-Do you think this is me?
-It's terrific.

64
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,760
-Frank Farmer's here.
-Who?

65
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,650
Frank Farmer. The bodyguard.

66
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,160
I think Rory should be my bodyguard.

67
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,820
Raise your butt and come meet him.

68
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,940
All right. I'm up.

69
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,170
Frank Farmer...

70
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,670
...Rachel Marron.

71
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,510
You don't look like a bodyguard.

72
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,780
What'd you expect?

73
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,190
Maybe a tough guy.

74
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,180
This is my disguise.

75
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,960
His timing's good.

76
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,190
This is Nicki, Rachel's sister
and personal secretary.

77
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,800
Nice to meet you.

78
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,870
Tony Scibelli.

79
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,040
Sy Spector, publicist.

80
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,710
Can we get you a drink?

81
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,710
An orange juice.

82
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,370
Straight?

83
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,320
This is Bill's idea.

84
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,990
A sudden obsession with protecting me.

85
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,490
Tony's always done my security
and we've done just fine.

86
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,150
Is this what we talked about?

87
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,230
Bill's right. It's time
you took more precautions.

88
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,560
I'm sure they'll say the number of
nuts writing fan letters jumps...

89
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,730
...whenever Rachel's on a magazine.

90
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,240
Not like this.

91
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,000
Relax, guys.

92
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,740
I said I'll do it, so I will.
See what I'm dealing with?

93
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,350
I'll do this as long as
we understand each other.

94
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,250
I won't let this thing alter my life.

95
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,580
Honey, that won't be a problem.

96
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,590
Rachel's household is informal.
We're all on a first-name basis.

97
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,350
You'll fit in fine.

98
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,520
Choose whatever alarm system
you want for the house.

99
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,430
Improved security for the gate.
What else?

100
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,440
What else?

101
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,700
I think I'm safe when I'm at the house.

102
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,440
-So the main thing is when I go out.
-Exactly.

103
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,710
Tony will fill you in. I don't want you
falling all over me everywhere I go.

104
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,110
Fletcher cannot be affected.

105
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,720
I'll cover that. We'll tell him
you've got some other function.

106
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,880
I don't want him to think he's in prison.
So the estate must not be altered.

107
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,620
He shouldn't even know you're here.

108
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,630
There's been a misunderstanding.

109
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,630
So if you'll show me the way out,
I'll save us both trouble.

110
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,770
By the pool.

111
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,730
It was nice meeting you.

112
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,140
Or the entry door.

113
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,740
Shut up. Wait a minute!

114
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,810
We shouldn't beg this guy.

115
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,750
I'm handling this. Farmer,
would you wait a minute?

116
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,260
I should have told you more.
I was afraid she wouldn't do it.

117
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,920
I thought I'd let you two work it out.

118
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,150
We did.

119
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,320
She's not a bad person and whether
she knows it or not, she needs you.

120
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,500
You've come this far, wait a moment.
I must show you something.

121
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,610
Please, Farmer.

122
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,530
How are you today?

123
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,630
Fine. And you?

124
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,700
Oh, I'm fine. Do you like boats?

125
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,370
No, I don't like boats.

126
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,240
Why not?

127
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,540
I don't know.

128
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,320
Sure you do. But you
don't want to tell me.

129
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,810
You're a smart kid.

130
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,050
One time I was...

131
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,390
...stuck on a boat with
some people for 4 months.

132
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,720
A lifeboat?

133
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,560
No, it was a...

134
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,670
...big, white yacht.

135
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,900
You're the bodyguard, aren't you?

136
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,560
What do you know about it?

137
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,500
I've got ears.

138
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,670
I'll remember that.

139
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,080
This is just in the last 6 months.

140
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,750
Have you ever had these
professionally assessed?

141
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,020
-I heard you were in the Secret Service.
-That's right.

142
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,590
You guard the main man?

143
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,360
I was 2 years with
Carter, 4 with Reagan.

144
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,030
Reagan got shot.

145
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,860
Not on my shift.

146
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,630
Good.

147
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,540
This could be something.

148
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,370
Do you think it could be the
same guy who rigged the doll?

149
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,710
Did you tell Miss Marron?

150
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,550
About the doll?

151
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,130
We said there'd been an electrical
problem, like a short circuit.

152
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,390
She doesn't need this kind of worry.
It'd really upset her.

153
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,620
What about the police?

154
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,790
No need. No one got hurt.

155
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,460
The chauffeur got hurt.

156
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,410
That was nothing.

157
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,800
It was just our people there.

158
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,910
I think we should show him the room.

159
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,150
Is this her bedroom?

160
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,490
She sleeps in the room next
to Fletcher's down the hall.

161
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,260
Sy had this done for a magazine layout.

162
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,170
Superstars in their boudoirs.

163
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,430
Did you see it?

164
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,110
We found the letter here.

165
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,480
Someone was in here?

166
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,780
Someone broke in and
masturbated on the bed.

167
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,620
-And she doesn't know?
-Are you kidding?

168
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,530
It'd really freak her out.

169
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,130
What do you think?

170
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,700
Someone penetrates the house...

171
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,130
...gets upstairs, jerks off on the bed.
I'd say...

172
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,200
...that qualifies as a problem.

173
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,870
We don't need this.

174
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,010
What kind?

175
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,310
-The house is wide open.
-Excuse me?

176
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,810
The house is wide open.

177
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,820
You people have no clue what
security is or how to achieve it.

178
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,320
I'll accommodate your work.

179
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,890
I can't protect her like this.

180
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,990
Like what?

181
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,060
I won't be responsible for her safety
if she doesn't know what's going on.

182
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,320
I'll make her understand.

183
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,670
I'll talk to her.

184
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,850
She won't give you any static.
You have my word.

185
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,080
Sure she will.

186
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,520
So what job's perfect?
You're a bodyguard, aren't you?

187
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,210
Guess what? It's Oscar time again.

188
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,290
This year the money's on Rachel
Marron for best actress.

189
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,960
And with the theme song
of " I Have Nothing"...

190
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,790
...still big on the charts...

191
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,800
...the versatile actress/singer
might end up having everything.

192
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,920
Why'd you say your name was Edison?

193
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,660
To see how difficult it was to get in.

194
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,760
And it wasn't.

195
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,110
-Put it on your arm.
-What's this?

196
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,020
It'll stop the ache.

197
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,620
I bet you can fill up a whole day
washing cars and driving Miss Marron.

198
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,360
That's my job.

199
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,860
We're adding to your duties.

200
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,390
You're my new assistant.

201
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,700
Says who?

202
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,370
I've spent a lot of time guarding people
and I've found one thing to be true.

203
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,480
No matter how incompetent the assassins,
or how much they miss their target...

204
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,140
...one person always gets hit.

205
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,540
Who?

206
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,890
The cocky black chauffeur.

207
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,220
Put this in the pool.

208
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,740
This gate will be replaced next week.
I'll have 2 cameras here.

209
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,010
A face camera by the call box...

210
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,910
...and a scene camera on top
of this pillar, looking down.

211
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,750
I want these trees to be cut back so
the lights can shine onto the property.

212
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,190
And the people who come into the
property, make sure who they are.

213
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,590
I want these all cut back, okay?

214
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,360
She paid a lot for the estate,
she ought to be able to see it.

215
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,430
-What're you looking at?
-Frank.

216
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,040
This fence is going to come around
this area and end by the gate.

217
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,040
Come on. Let's go.

218
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,220
Not yet, not yet, not yet. Now brake!

219
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,450
Power.

220
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,290
Stop.

221
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,320
Come here!

222
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,320
Come here.

223
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,990
That's an unusual tactic for a
guard dog. But it's effective.

224
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,160
You can look around if you want.

225
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,000
Sorry to disturb you.

226
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,770
It's okay. It's an excuse to rest.

227
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,940
This is my personal place.
I'm the only one who works out here.

228
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,190
My own ego wall.
No platinum records.

229
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,450
This is you and Rachel?

230
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,520
When I was a kid, I put
together this little band.

231
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,360
We played school dances
and stuff like that.

232
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,860
Rachel joined the act
and as you can imagine...

233
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,370
...she was quite an entertainer.

234
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,140
Even then she could stop the show.

235
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,800
So....

236
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,040
I quit.

237
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,880
Professionally, anyway.

238
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,540
You never went back?

239
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,050
It was pretty obvious who
the star in our family was.

240
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,230
Lot of work went into this.

241
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,490
Lot of work.

242
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,720
No fingerprints, though.

243
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,660
You think this is tied to the doll?

244
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,560
Her manager does.

245
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,040
" I have nothing" is natural,
given the record, the movie.

246
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,570
I lost track of you after Washington.

247
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,180
How's the private stuff?

248
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,350
It's fine.

249
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,920
Big money?

250
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,680
It's big money, right?

251
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,100
You wouldn't want this job.

252
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,540
It is big money! Fuck! I knew it!
You need an assistant?

253
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,540
I'm due to get out of here and l
have had it with assholic behavior.

254
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,040
What a scumbag we're covering now.

255
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,540
A walking schlong senator
who shall remain nameless.

256
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,110
Hellfire Henry Kent.

257
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,950
Someone wants to pop him.

258
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,950
No surprise, with what the
shithead's been saying.

259
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,110
Do everyone a favor.

260
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,120
As you know, we're
non-political these days.

261
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,130
I'll send it to Behavioral Sciences.
I'll have an answer in a few days.

262
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,290
Thanks.

263
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,800
Why am I getting all this cooperation?

264
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,400
Are you kidding?

265
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,470
She's a big star.
Important people care about her.

266
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,080
Politics and showbiz, it's
the same thing these days.

267
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,140
Thanks.

268
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,980
There she is.

269
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,150
Can I have your autograph?

270
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,420
Sure you can.

271
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,930
We're big fans. Can we get a photo?

272
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,000
She'll be thrilled. You're her favorite
actress. We've seen all your movies.

273
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,500
Take a good one.

274
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,600
Thank you so much.

275
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,500
She'll appreciate it.

276
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,110
I'm surprised you didn't plug them.

277
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,360
Help me with this stuff.
You sign "much love, Rachel"...

278
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,870
...you sign, "peace and love, Rachel."

279
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,700
Let me set you straight on a few things.

280
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,540
For starters, I love this lady.

281
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,050
What I do for her, I do out of love.

282
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm not some hired fucking gun who's
here to make her life miserable.

283
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,980
I do things the way she likes.

284
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,820
Her happiness is everything to me.

285
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,060
No problem. I'd like to
know how you handle things.

286
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,060
I handle things fine.

287
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,500
Watch me and learn.

288
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,870
Turn right.

289
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,160
Is that him?

290
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,400
What's going on?

291
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,170
Short cut.

292
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,170
Want me to do a 180?

293
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,400
Slow down.

294
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,420
Go up to the house!

295
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,920
Shut up! Shut up! Just shut up!

296
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,430
He's through messing with my life.

297
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,940
I'm getting sick of running up here
every time he steps on your toes.

298
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,170
Farmer, come in here.

299
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,780
-He's nuts!
-Guess who couldn't get in yesterday?

300
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,680
Robin Leach.

301
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,620
That's funny?! He speaks to 20 million
people and he can't get in here!

302
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,950
He had an appointment?

303
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,960
What about brunch at Charlie's?

304
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,460
Rachel goes there every Sunday.

305
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,290
She's not to do things
she's always done.

306
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,700
" Not to do things she's always done."
He's a fanatic!

307
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,860
So're the guys he's protecting you from.

308
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,700
Excuse me if I don't faint.

309
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,540
Then think about your son.

310
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,380
What do you want?

311
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,140
I want some peace around here!

312
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,480
That's right.

313
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,320
We're almost done.

314
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,160
And I want to be able to
eat brunch with my friends.

315
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,660
So go on Tuesdays.

316
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,500
Tuesday morning brunch.
Where'd you get him?

317
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,340
Louise, you have great stuff.

318
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,170
Take it all.

319
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,500
Try this on.

320
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,250
Hey, Farmer...

321
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,580
...want to come in with me?

322
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,680
Just to be safe?

323
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,430
You won't believe this...

324
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,270
...but I have a reputation
for being a bitch.

325
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,370
I didn't use to be.

326
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,600
But you get known for being a certain
way, a way people think you are...

327
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,220
...and pretty soon, you get like that.

328
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,620
Guess you can't help it.

329
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,630
You don't think so?

330
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,720
You're an expert on famous people.

331
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,230
I've seen a few.

332
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,800
And you disagree?

333
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,230
You can be as you choose to be.

334
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:12,300
It's an act of discipline,
but it can be done.

335
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,980
Is that why you never stay with your
clients? They too undisciplined for you?

336
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,070
Or maybe you start caring about them?

337
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,150
Right.

338
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,490
Can't you answer straight once?

339
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,820
You're too clever for me.
I can't keep up.

340
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,980
Look at me, Farmer!

341
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,430
You don't approve of me.

342
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,660
Disapproval's a luxury I can't afford.

343
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,430
It gets in the way? Don't like
your emotions getting to you?

344
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,670
Never mix business with pleasure?

345
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,940
That's right.

346
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,610
Will you grab that red jacket?

347
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,290
I'm here to keep you alive,
not help you shop.

348
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,690
Thanks.

349
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,140
-Two minutes.
-Three.

350
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,150
Wait. I want to make it really full.

351
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,540
Put it straight up.

352
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,530
Right there.

353
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,870
You must hold it still.

354
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,380
What're we looking for?

355
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,040
Bomb.

356
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,950
Don't worry, I already checked.

357
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,450
Put it back here a little deeper.

358
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,720
Hold it.

359
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,120
Okay, now turn it. Good.
There, right there.

360
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,890
Pull up there for a second.

361
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,970
Son-of-a...

362
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,130
I thought it was dinner.

363
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,130
Are we going somewhere else?

364
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,400
The Mayan.

365
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,080
What's that?

366
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,910
It's a club. Let's go.

367
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,140
You must tell me about these things.

368
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,750
I just did.

369
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,150
Nice suit, Frank.

370
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,260
I want you to keep this.

371
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,260
It's beautiful.

372
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,330
It's fitted with a radio transmitter.

373
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,840
The clasp sends a signal.
If there's ever a problem, press it.

374
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,500
I'll know you need me.

375
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,610
She knows how it works.

376
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,110
Let's go.

377
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,280
Come on, let's go.

378
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,510
Look!

379
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,290
Look at this great show.
They don't forget.

380
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,530
Get inside. The show's inside.

381
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,870
Henry, just keep driving.

382
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,820
How're you doing?

383
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,070
He's from Paris, an amazing director.

384
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,240
A performance artist. This is
his first video. Rachel loves it.

385
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,250
This is Sy's idea.

386
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,410
-I thought she'd talk to you.
-You said I had an exclusive.

387
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,680
Maybe later. What can I say?
Laurie! How are you?

388
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,690
You know Paul. I'll speak to you later.

389
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,260
She doesn't do these places.
He thinks it'll help the video.

390
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,200
He sent another one.

391
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,940
What do you mean, another one?

392
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,220
What do you mean?

393
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,720
-They didn't tell you.
-Tell me what?

394
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,890
There were some letters before.
Same kind of threat.

395
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,890
We didn't want to worry you.

396
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,120
And somebody got into the house.

397
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,730
In my house?

398
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,890
-Let's not get hysterical.
-We should go.

399
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,630
While Fletcher was there?!

400
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,570
The house is like Fort Knox.

401
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,300
-Right?
-We should go.

402
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,810
No one could...

403
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,910
-Could what?!
-Calm down.

404
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,480
Everyone calm down.

405
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,310
Let's just see how she is.

406
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,070
How are you?

407
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,660
"Watch the door" means
no candy, no flowers.

408
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,500
Is he out there?

409
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,270
He's here, isn't he?

410
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,300
Maybe.

411
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,270
We don't know that.

412
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,170
You know he was in my house!

413
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,280
Let's go home. We'll have
to make an announcement.

414
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,510
Fine, fine. Bill, you make it!

415
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,670
Tell them!

416
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,110
They'll tear the place apart!

417
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,520
Ladies and gentlemen...

418
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,030
...I'm sorry but...

419
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,190
...due to circumstances
beyond our control...

420
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,630
Wait!

421
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,140
Don't do it. It's not worth it.

422
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,040
No fucking freak will run me off stage.

423
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,550
Give it up front.

424
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,550
Let's go. We're on.

425
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,050
We're not coming.

426
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,320
I'm afraid Rachel will not
be able to appear tonight.

427
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,730
Just a minute. Give me a chance.

428
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,670
Bill Devaney, everybody!

429
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,340
Hello!

430
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,750
Just wanted to stop by
and maybe sing a song.

431
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,750
I hope you don't mind.

432
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,190
All right. Thank you so much!

433
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,850
Isn't Billy Thomas the greatest?
Let's give him a hand.

434
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,190
Go for it, Rachel.

435
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,430
Want to see my new video?

436
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,730
Are we having a communication problem?

437
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,410
What?

438
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,640
Are we having a communication problem?

439
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,080
Keep this aisle clear.

440
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,080
I know what you're saying.

441
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,420
You've got a job to do. But you
must understand Rachel does too.

442
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,980
And that's what she's doing.

443
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,490
Out there.

444
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,100
Look, she's so hot now.

445
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,100
If she doesn't get out there...

446
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,320
...she's dead.

447
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,170
Forget the crazy death threats,
if she doesn't sing...

448
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,100
...she's dead anyway.

449
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:13,780
Handled properly, this thing could be
worth a million in free publicity.

450
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,640
No.

451
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:18,950
-It could clinch the nomination.
-One word in print about this...

452
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,730
Out of the way!

453
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,700
I'll get it.

454
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,270
Follow me!

455
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,880
-Let us through!
-Fuck you!

456
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,790
Where's the fucking limo?

457
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,800
Henry! It's me, Sy!

458
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,240
Stop it! Fuck!

459
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,650
Keep driving.

460
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,100
Never done that before.

461
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,540
It's been a long night.

462
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,270
Don't you want to know
why I behave that way?

463
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,590
I know why.

464
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,090
I don't want to talk about this again.

465
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,060
Got you, didn't I?

466
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,830
Bet you wonder what I'm doing.

467
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,230
You didn't know I jog?

468
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,780
Afraid I might get picked
off in my running suit?

469
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,450
No. I'm afraid that I'm going
to have to jog with you.

470
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,520
Will you walk with me?

471
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,790
I know this is kind of late...

472
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,700
...but thank you.

473
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,170
I'm glad you're here.

474
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:17,700
And I'm going to try to cooperate.

475
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,630
That would be good.

476
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,480
Farmer, I have this problem.

477
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,480
This minor little problem.

478
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,390
I'd like to go out for an evening.

479
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,120
With a guy. Like a date.

480
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,550
But...

481
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,890
...I can't go out...

482
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,060
...on a date because you must
be with me every minute.

483
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,840
What if he wants to invite me up
to his place? Will you come too?

484
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,730
So...

485
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,840
...the only thing I can figure...

486
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,500
...is for you to take me out.

487
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,020
That's what I was wondering.

488
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,150
You know?

489
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,690
What do you think?

490
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,850
Only if you want to.

491
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,690
Only if you want to.

492
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,100
God, this is so embarrassing.

493
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,700
You decide, okay?

494
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,430
Sandy Harris is on the phone.

495
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:28,540
Tell her I'll call her back.
I'm getting fixed up.

496
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:05,700
He didn't look like he wanted to die.

497
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,800
There's a big difference between...

498
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,640
...wanting to die and not fearing death.

499
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:17,710
And so because he had no fear
of death, he was invincible?

500
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:19,820
What do you think?

501
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,450
He sure creamed them all in the end.

502
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,450
That was a good movie.

503
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,290
How many times have you seen it?

504
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,230
62 times.

505
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,670
-I've seen it a lot.
-You can say that!

506
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,240
I've seen it a lot.

507
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,750
Your kind of place?

508
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,030
Your kind of music?

509
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,590
Absolutely.

510
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,690
You figure no one can get by you here.

511
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:15,100
If someone's willing to swap his life
for a kill, nothing can stop him.

512
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,340
What do I need you for?

513
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,720
He might get me instead.

514
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:25,110
You're ready to die for me?

515
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,220
That's the job.

516
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:29,720
And you'd do it?

517
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:32,950
Why?

518
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,730
I can't sing.

519
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:43,000
Maybe there is some glory in saving a
president or somebody but...

520
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,230
...just anybody?

521
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,800
Like you?

522
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:47,630
Yeah, like me.

523
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,300
It's a matter of discipline.

524
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,980
I don't trust discipline.

525
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,150
I know at that crucial
moment I'd cop out.

526
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,550
It happens.

527
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,450
But not to you, fierce Frank.

528
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,260
It happens.

529
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,990
So have you ever liked anybody?

530
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:13,460
What do you mean?

531
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,330
Like me, a girl?

532
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,410
Yeah, a long time ago.

533
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,010
What happened?

534
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,680
Do you mind if I ask?

535
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,280
You mind if I don't answer?

536
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,840
I don't want to pry.

537
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,180
Oh, yeah, I can see that.

538
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:37,780
What?

539
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:40,690
She didn't die, did she?

540
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,590
While you were protecting
her she got killed, right?

541
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,370
God! That's not it, is it?

542
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,210
That's it, isn't it?

543
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,880
Nobody's perfect.

544
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,390
I'm sorry, Frank.

545
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,830
I'm sorry.

546
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,530
Nice try, though.

547
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:31,340
It was less dramatic than that.

548
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:34,350
She didn't love me anymore.

549
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,180
Can you imagine that?

550
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,910
No, not really.

551
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:58,860
So...

552
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:01,770
...is this a full-service date?

553
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:10,280
I'm just asking you to dance.

554
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:14,950
Come on.

555
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,290
You can dance, can't you?

556
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,990
This is kind of a cowboy song?

557
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,840
Nothing. It's nothing.

558
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:21,340
I mean, it's so depressing.
Have you listened to the words?

559
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,760
-It is kind of depressing.
-Yes, it is.

560
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:37,300
It's one of those somebody's-
always-leaving-somebody songs.

561
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:49,380
Don't worry.

562
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,550
Don't worry.

563
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,220
I'll protect you.

564
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,180
It's very quiet here.

565
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,420
You ever going to hang these up?

566
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:38,020
Maybe when I'm here long enough.

567
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:41,600
West Virginia University Football.

568
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,400
God!

569
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,530
Take a look at you.

570
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,840
What'd you play?

571
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,270
The end.

572
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,430
Were you tough?

573
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:54,600
No, I was fast.

574
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,960
So you were in the Secret Service?

575
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,760
What made you get out?

576
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,760
Money.

577
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,870
I can see your tastes are extravagant.

578
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,800
May l?

579
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:46,500
Be careful.

580
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,600
You're a hard one to figure out.

581
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:33,270
A bodyguard must know very little peace.

582
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,130
Watch this.

583
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,380
I've never felt this safe before.

584
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:50,390
No one could get by you.

585
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:56,150
Right now it might not be too difficult.

586
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,220
What are you doing?

587
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:44,040
I don't want to get confused
about what I'm doing here.

588
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,610
I'm not confused.

589
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:49,780
You pay me to protect you.
That's what I do.

590
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,880
Did I do something wrong?

591
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,710
Nothing.

592
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,480
Then what is it?

593
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,150
Do you want me to beg?

594
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,450
What's going on, Frank?

595
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:23,340
I want to keep straight what my job is.

596
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,580
And what is that, exactly?
Making me feel like shit?

597
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,080
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

598
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:35,090
Don't apologize. Just tell me
what I did. I'm a big girl.

599
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,820
You didn't do anything.

600
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,660
It was me.

601
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:41,460
I got involved with my client.

602
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,660
Your client?!

603
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,660
I made a mistake.

604
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:48,300
So you're not attracted
to your client anymore?

605
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,530
Christ, I told you why!

606
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,600
I can't protect you like this.

607
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,110
So that's it for me?

608
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,480
That's it?

609
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,790
I don't believe it!

610
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,490
Accept it, or fire me.

611
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,390
But I can't fuck you.

612
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,410
She's real mad at you, isn't she?

613
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,150
She said she doesn't know why
you're being so shitty to her.

614
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,820
I don't like you to use that language.

615
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:49,670
I spent a lot of time learning not to
react to things like other people.

616
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:51,830
That's my job.

617
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:54,600
It doesn't always work.

618
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,540
It doesn't always work.

619
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,170
I don't think I understand.

620
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:05,620
I'm an old man compared to you
and I don't understand either.

621
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:08,610
I'm starting to get the feeling...

622
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,450
...that I never will.

623
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,930
I thought you'd like to know.

624
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:23,630
Everyone said she was a sure thing.

625
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,460
But you already knew that.

626
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:37,210
Sorry. It's completely out of line.
It was none of my business.

627
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:55,070
It's off to Miami today for Best
Actress nominee Rachel Marron.

628
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:59,730
She'll give two AlDS charity concerts
at the Fontainebleau Hilton.

629
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:01,430
$1,000 a plate, no less.

630
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:05,340
And it's a brave man who'd
deny she's worth every cent.

631
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:16,280
This is Mobile 1 to Station 2.
Zero 2, engineering.

632
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:20,320
Have them do a 14 reference to
presidential suite balcony.

633
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:27,090
It's okay. They're cleared.

634
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:32,640
Mobile 2 to Catering. Security
says to clear kitchen aisle...

635
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:36,470
...of all obstructions and traffic,
effective immediately.

636
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,800
Mobile 2 to front of house.

637
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:43,180
Security requests updated list of
all ticket holders for concert.

638
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:48,120
Please fax copies of any names which are
added to the list to Security Office.

639
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,720
What a silly job this is.

640
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,430
Okay, we're rolling!

641
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,720
-Showtime, everybody!
-ls this necessary?

642
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,030
Yes, it is. Let's go.

643
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,500
Quit bitching. You get paid for this.

644
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:08,510
Rachel, can you give us
a couple of minutes?

645
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,300
-How do you like our city?
-I love it! I love Miami!

646
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,860
Did you arrange all this?

647
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,800
Hey, that's me!

648
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,710
Hello, Frank.

649
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,710
It's been a long time.

650
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:19,280
You working?

651
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:23,490
Not technically, but
the Governor may come...

652
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:26,290
...so I thought I'd give a light check.

653
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,500
Someone else is covering him now.

654
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:31,560
How old's she?

655
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:33,130
Maybe 18.

656
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:43,200
Thank you.

657
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:46,680
Thank you so much.
Listen, you're so right.

658
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,320
I want you all to have a good time...

659
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:54,750
...and drink as much of Ben Schiller's
liquor as you possibly can.

660
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,320
Thank you.

661
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:00,860
I'd call that a step
up from the President.

662
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:03,860
Probably sings better too.

663
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:06,720
Handful.

664
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,940
Lost track of you
after the Reagan thing.

665
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,700
Wasn't your fault.

666
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:20,010
You weren't even there.

667
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:27,350
I need a drink.

668
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,790
Orange juice.

669
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:38,890
Who're you?

670
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,360
Greg Portman.

671
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,900
I take it you've met my bodyguard.

672
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,910
We used to work together.

673
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:50,740
Well, well, well.

674
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,110
What do you do now?

675
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,910
Same thing as Farmer.

676
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,980
Two samurai, huh?

677
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,990
So are you working now?

678
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:05,590
Not right now.

679
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,120
Good.

680
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:11,230
Because I'm the only person in
this room that needs protection.

681
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,770
Let's get a drink. A real one.

682
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,850
Orange juice, sir?

683
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:45,630
I've been watching you all
night from across the room.

684
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,860
Why don't you go back and watch?

685
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,130
No, I'm not doing this.

686
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,140
You are.

687
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:38,610
Please go now.

688
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,390
Not right now.

689
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,160
Mr. Portman was just leaving.

690
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,920
Good night, Rachel.

691
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,510
Shit.

692
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,100
What are you looking at?

693
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,110
You probably never had a heavy night
in your whole disciplined life.

694
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,410
Coffee?

695
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:25,190
You're a self-righteous bastard.

696
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:29,430
Don't laugh! Don't dare judge me!

697
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,120
Give me a break. I didn't tell
you to fuck everyone in the hotel!

698
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,130
Fuck this. I don't need this shit.

699
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:45,480
Industrial detergent.
It matches the traces in the glue.

700
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:49,110
We'll nail this sucker.

701
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:51,480
Don't take too long.

702
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,950
It's good money, isn't it?

703
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,430
It's good money.

704
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:31,290
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

705
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:35,160
-Where's Tony?
-I thought you were with her.

706
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,540
Thuringer, this is Farmer.
Where's your man at the door?

707
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,700
The door to the suite! Where is he?

708
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,010
Get someone up here, now!

709
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,300
He doesn't know.

710
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,850
Where're you going?

711
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:05,490
Where in the hell have you been?

712
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:09,100
I went to Bal Harbor to shop.

713
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,730
You want these in the bedroom?

714
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:13,090
Leave them so I can look at them.

715
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:16,400
You had us worried. You know
you're not supposed to do that.

716
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:19,670
I'll do what I want when I want.

717
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:21,870
Besides...

718
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,210
...I'm tired of hanging
around deadbeats.

719
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,110
No offense Tony.

720
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,220
Once more and I'm gone.

721
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:38,950
You remember something.
You work here. You work for me!

722
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:40,960
Where're you going?

723
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:43,220
To check the route, as usual.

724
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:47,930
Did Fletcher call?

725
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:13,990
Gomez!

726
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:29,270
What are you doing?

727
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:31,400
None of your fucking business.

728
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:33,440
Move!

729
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,950
Stick it up your ass!

730
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:55,770
Stop! Don't hurt my husband, mister!

731
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:59,430
Please, don't hurt my husband.
He not up to nothing.

732
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:13,320
I'm sorry.

733
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,530
Hello.

734
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:31,800
Mommy?

735
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:34,870
Fletcher, is that you?

736
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,340
Listen.

737
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:46,550
I'm through, Bill.

738
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:49,710
I'm through. I'll get you
back to L.A. and that's it.

739
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:52,020
Fletcher's guard'll cover you.

740
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,350
She got another call.

741
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,890
-I don't care.
-It was him. Same guy.

742
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,090
I don't care!

743
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:02,730
It really shook her up. She thought
it was Fletcher calling from L.A.

744
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,670
I know she'll be reasonable now.
Come on.

745
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,430
Save it, Devaney!

746
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:11,570
Those who hire me don't have to be
convinced to save their own lives!

747
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,510
Call me when she's ready.

748
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,090
Nothing that's happened
between us matters.

749
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,260
I understand now.

750
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:11,100
You must believe me because
I'm not going to beg.

751
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,510
It wasn't what he said...

752
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,510
...it was the way he said it.

753
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:23,970
Frank, I need you. I'm afraid.

754
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,580
And I hate my fear.

755
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:32,660
Please protect me. Protect Fletcher.

756
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:35,190
If anything happened to him....

757
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,130
I can't.

758
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,460
I can't.

759
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:42,200
I can't protect you like this.

760
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:46,840
It's impossible.
The odds are all on his side.

761
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:51,210
I will do whatever you say.

762
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:02,950
I'd want to take you away from here.

763
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:05,690
I can do that.

764
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:14,330
It'd mean cancelling your concerts.

765
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:19,400
All right.

766
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:22,340
No more Sy.

767
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,180
Give Devaney and Tony a vacation.

768
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,810
Okay.

769
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:37,710
You cross me up this time, l
swear I'll kill you myself.

770
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,480
Lake's low.

771
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,910
It'll rise when it thaws.

772
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,690
They all in trouble?

773
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,070
Just one.

774
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,770
He likes you.

775
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:08,200
So is that going to protect us?

776
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,620
He's a trained noisemaker.

777
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:13,290
Come here, Foster.

778
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,020
Just what we need.

779
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:19,220
I don't like big dogs.
They don't know who they're eating.

780
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,850
And this one does?

781
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:23,460
Yeah, this one does.

782
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:37,140
Excuse me.

783
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,250
Katherine had this place
organized the way she wanted it.

784
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:43,640
That's Frank's mama.

785
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,160
Fletcher can't swim very well.

786
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,660
He better stay in the boat then.

787
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,680
Frank says you're a singer.

788
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,410
That's right.

789
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,920
We're kind of out of things up here.
I'm sorry.

790
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:21,420
That's okay.

791
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,590
You must be very successful if
you need someone like Frank.

792
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:31,690
It's quiet here.

793
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,930
Frank spent 6 months here
after that Reagan thing.

794
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,300
Reagan thing?

795
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,880
Frank was gone when Reagan was shot.
He never got over it.

796
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,550
That's the day we buried Katherine.

797
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,310
He's a rascal now.

798
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,450
Tell us.

799
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:00,550
I never hit him.

800
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,130
-Ever.
-You should have.

801
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:04,630
That's unusual for my people.

802
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:07,830
So what happens is, he's
about 10 years old...

803
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:10,460
...and he starts complaining to me.

804
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:11,900
How about that.

805
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,470
Dad, I'll tell them about the
time you stripped in court.

806
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,580
I want to hear this.

807
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:20,900
I'm proud of that!

808
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,910
So, anyway, he starts
playing tackle football...

809
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:29,850
...when he's 10 and one day he comes to
me and says he's afraid of being hit.

810
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:34,350
Says it's my fault. "How come
you never hit me?" he says to me.

811
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,160
How about that? He got over it.

812
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:40,600
Turned into one hell of a wide receiver.

813
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:45,260
He was always like that, my son.
Couldn't stand being afraid.

814
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:50,100
Something scared him, he'd just keep
doing it until the fear went away.

815
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:53,950
His mama was the same way.

816
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,950
You have a beautiful family.

817
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:58,950
-You had enough to eat?
-Fletcher, wipe your mouth.

818
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,950
-Save some for dessert.
-You through, bucket mouth?

819
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:06,460
I won't tell about when you
were 13 and discovered girls.

820
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,290
Come on.

821
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:15,630
You can run but you can't hide.

822
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,540
I'm black, right?

823
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:25,200
You know you're white. Your move!

824
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:27,400
My move? You're sure?

825
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:30,210
The last move, I took your rook.

826
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,720
That's right.

827
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:46,060
How long has this been going on?

828
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,990
3 years.

829
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,930
First year he had me on the run.

830
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,840
What do you think?

831
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,750
Knight to king-four.

832
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:04,840
City kid.

833
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:24,600
Son, you come here and sit with me.

834
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,770
Well, that's it for me, guys.
I'm going to bed.

835
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,880
You're in trouble.

836
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:49,490
Foster, right here. Turn around.

837
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:07,580
Good night, Rachel.

838
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:10,410
Good night, Frank.

839
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:13,140
Good night, Foster. Good night.

840
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,420
It's good to hear you laugh.

841
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,820
Stay.

842
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:47,350
You're very thorough.

843
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,460
What's happening with you and Rachel?

844
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:02,970
One minute she has magnetic
hands and the next she hates you.

845
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:05,470
I don't know what's going on now.

846
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:08,140
You follow all her moves this closely?

847
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,570
It's a living.

848
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,980
No, it's not.

849
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,820
You must think my life's pretty sick.

850
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:29,230
You must. I do.

851
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,730
Then why don't you change it?

852
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,230
Is it that easy?

853
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,180
You're a lovely woman.

854
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,620
But you don't want me?

855
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:04,260
I'm surprised. Thorough fellow like you.

856
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,130
Why stop at one sister when
you can fuck them both?

857
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:11,130
I make my mistakes.

858
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,770
But you didn't say no to the boss.

859
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,290
Is this elk?

860
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,660
- A dear?
- Yes

861
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,730
Big.

862
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,300
First time I've heard church
music in the middle of the week.

863
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:06,420
Jesus loves me, oh, yes, he does.

864
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:15,430
Jesus loves us, oh, yes, he does.

865
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:25,210
Jesus loves us, oh, yes, he does.

866
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,610
For the Bible...

867
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:35,850
...tells me so.

868
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,450
-Hi, kiddo.
-Hi, honey.

869
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,580
Where's Fletcher?

870
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:33,880
Help!

871
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:35,240
He can't swim!

872
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:46,620
Help!

873
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:49,230
Help!

874
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:52,160
Let me have him!

875
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,640
What were you doing?

876
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:08,410
You're crazy!

877
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:09,710
You are out of your mind!

878
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:13,720
You could have drowned him!
You could have drowned him!

879
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,420
I'm sorry.

880
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:18,360
I got careless.

881
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:23,720
How will we get the boat back?

882
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:35,560
Put them in there.

883
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:49,750
Someone's cut the phone lines. Could
be anywhere between here and town.

884
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,750
Both cars are dead. I don't see how.

885
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,590
Who knows you're here?

886
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:59,890
I don't know. This place
has nothing to do with her.

887
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:02,590
Maybe it has to do with you.

888
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:07,230
And we can't walk out of here at night.

889
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:08,470
I know.

890
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,870
We'll stay and walk out at first light.

891
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:32,550
I was an idiot last night.

892
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:40,560
What'd you think about today?

893
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:50,000
I think this is no maniac.

894
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:53,340
He knows what he's doing.

895
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:56,880
You're right. He does.

896
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:02,020
Tell me about it.

897
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,590
-Who is it?
-He almost got Fletcher...

898
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:07,090
How do we stop him?

899
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:09,820
-He almost got the baby!
-Who is it?

900
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:11,520
I don't know.

901
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:12,830
Call it off.

902
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:15,830
He doesn't even know who hired him.

903
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,530
I don't know who he is and
he doesn't know who I am.

904
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,200
How did you do it?

905
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:25,270
How?

906
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,740
I went to a bar in East L.A.

907
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:32,680
I asked around. And there was this guy.

908
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:33,840
Name?

909
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,850
-Armando.
-Give me his name!

910
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:37,920
Armando.

911
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:45,560
He arranged it, that's all I know.

912
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:47,860
It's all paid?

913
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:52,870
Is it paid for?

914
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:55,940
And then some, okay? Till it's done.

915
01:32:58,310 --> 01:33:00,640
He keeps going until he kills her?

916
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:07,880
-What's the name of the bar?
-I'm not sure.

917
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:09,250
I was stoned.

918
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:15,260
All right. How about the letters?

919
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:19,600
The letters came first. I don't
know who's writing the letters.

920
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,500
Shit, but they're reading my mind.

921
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,970
Those are my thoughts. I hate her.

922
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,970
It made me think I could do it.

923
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:37,110
But I would never hurt the baby.
I would never hurt Fletcher!

924
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,270
I know.

925
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:42,450
You must stop it.

926
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:43,610
We will.

927
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:45,460
You and me.

928
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:56,460
Don't you want to know why?

929
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:58,470
You told me.

930
01:33:58,570 --> 01:33:59,800
She has everything.

931
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:07,700
What if we can't find him?

932
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:15,950
Stay here and don't move.

933
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:34,030
-It's me!
-God!

934
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:36,170
What's happening?

935
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:37,800
Stay with her!

936
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:41,410
-Where's Nicki?
-No! No, stop! I'm the one--

937
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,830
-Dad?
-We're okay.

938
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:20,680
-Doesn't make sense.
-What do you mean?

939
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:21,910
We got him.

940
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:24,140
What do you mean? Where?

941
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:27,840
Here. Last night. In L.A.
You should see this guy's locker.

942
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,680
He's obsessed with her.

943
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,150
You sure it's him?

944
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,690
Forensics say a 100% positive lD.

945
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:36,290
And he's got a black Toyota 4 x 4.

946
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,990
We know you did it.

947
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:40,100
Ray's with him now.

948
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:45,700
It's you that sent her the letters.
We don't need you to admit it.

949
01:36:45,870 --> 01:36:46,930
We know!

950
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:49,170
We know it!

951
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:54,010
Whoever you got down there wasn't here
last night. This was a professional.

952
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:55,940
This is crazy.

953
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,710
What do you want to do?

954
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:01,110
How long can you keep him?

955
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:04,190
All he's done is write some letters.

956
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,320
48 hours maximum. You know the deal.

957
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:10,320
I know.

958
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:21,060
Strict security surrounded the funeral
of music executive Nicki Marron...

959
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:25,870
...who was shot at a lakeside
retreat by an unknown intruder.

960
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:29,000
Nicki was the eldest
sister of Rachel Marron.

961
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:33,550
A spokesman for the Oscar-nominated
actress said she was devastated...

962
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:38,020
...and added that naturally it cast a
pall over the upcoming award ceremony.

963
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:54,790
You okay?

964
01:38:56,470 --> 01:39:00,100
Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay.
How about yourself?

965
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,710
I couldn't sleep.

966
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:08,650
It was so scary, just thinking about it.

967
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,710
Are you scared?

968
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:15,580
Everybody's afraid of something.

969
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:20,490
That's how we know we
care about things...

970
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:23,120
...when we're scared to lose them.

971
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,670
What are you afraid of?

972
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:32,140
I think you should try
to go back to sleep.

973
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:37,680
Is it the man who killed Nicki?

974
01:39:39,850 --> 01:39:41,750
Are you afraid of him?

975
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,220
Then what?

976
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:49,620
What are you afraid of?

977
01:39:56,530 --> 01:39:58,220
I'm afraid of not...

978
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:01,160
...being there.

979
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:10,700
It's late. Want me to
take you up to your room?

980
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,470
May I sit down?

981
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:22,840
It isn't over yet, is it?

982
01:41:26,490 --> 01:41:28,010
So he'll come again?

983
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:30,720
It's possible.

984
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:33,150
At the Oscars?

985
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:36,190
Maybe.

986
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,500
Back in Squirrel Hill...

987
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:48,640
...I started betting my friends 50 bucks
each that someday I'd win an Oscar.

988
01:41:50,510 --> 01:41:54,340
So it's very important for them
to see me up there if I win.

989
01:41:55,980 --> 01:42:00,280
If every one of those pikers comes
through, it'd add up to a lot of money.

990
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:07,890
I don't know, Rachel.

991
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:10,220
I think it's still dangerous.

992
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:13,890
I didn't get here by doing
the smart thing every time.

993
01:42:17,670 --> 01:42:18,830
How about you?

994
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:23,670
Out there on the edge.

995
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,180
Haven't you done something
that didn't make sense...

996
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:31,910
...except inside you? In your stomach?

997
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,390
I know you have.

998
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:40,490
Because no one gets good without it.

999
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:42,690
And I know you're good.

1000
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:49,560
Look...

1001
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:53,100
...I don't know why this is happening...

1002
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,410
...but I know it's not your fault.

1003
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:01,940
And I hope you can hear me because
this is the way I say I'm sorry.

1004
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:04,880
So...

1005
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:08,510
...I'm going to the
Oscars and see if I win.

1006
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,510
And I won't worry about
it at all, because...

1007
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:15,280
...I have you to protect me.

1008
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:18,530
That's right.

1009
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,730
That's right.

1010
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:12,410
We'll go straight back to the Green Room.
Got that, Tony?

1011
01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:14,280
Tony knows what he's doing.

1012
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:19,290
I wish you guys would relax.
Nothing bad's going to happen.

1013
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:20,880
Right?

1014
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:23,590
Unless I lose the award.

1015
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:28,370
Jesus, what a crew!

1016
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:33,200
Screw it.

1017
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,370
I'm tired of worrying.

1018
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:37,300
When your time is up...

1019
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:39,500
...it's up.

1020
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:41,980
Right, Frank?

1021
01:45:06,010 --> 01:45:08,470
-Rachel Marron, how are you?
-Fine. And you?

1022
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:10,010
Good. You look lovely.

1023
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:12,240
-Thank you.
-And they love you, don't they?

1024
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:13,640
They're going wild!

1025
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:16,340
So are you the queen of this night?

1026
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:17,710
Let's hope so.

1027
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:22,640
Good luck. Everybody's pulling for you.
Rachel Marron, everybody.

1028
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:32,660
And the award for best
achievement in sound...

1029
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:34,860
...goes to...

1030
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:36,660
...Kay Colvin...

1031
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:39,860
...and Mychal Smith for "Hot and Cold."

1032
01:46:01,130 --> 01:46:02,990
Thank you so much.

1033
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,590
I want to thank our producers.

1034
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:12,300
There is a gap, house left, rows EE FF.
Get me some fillers.

1035
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:18,470
You look beautiful. I just need to
tell you your responsibilities.

1036
01:46:20,610 --> 01:46:23,310
Now it's Best Sound.
Then a song, then you.

1037
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:26,780
At 8:07, you will be
presenting with Clive Healy.

1038
01:46:27,490 --> 01:46:28,920
Your lines.

1039
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:32,490
The TelePrompTer is straight ahead
and, we pray, working perfectly.

1040
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:38,930
I understand it's my honor
to escort you on stage.

1041
01:46:39,170 --> 01:46:43,330
That's right and I don't like it one
bit that you look skinnier than me.

1042
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:44,730
I wish.

1043
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:47,740
How's the Hollywood cricket scene?

1044
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:52,810
Coming out of commercial. Five,
four, three, two. Cue music.

1045
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:55,580
Cue Robert.

1046
01:46:58,450 --> 01:47:00,510
Welcome back to the Academy Awards.

1047
01:47:00,650 --> 01:47:02,120
Stand by, dancers.

1048
01:47:02,290 --> 01:47:05,660
I just heard that in New York
the economy is so bad...

1049
01:47:05,830 --> 01:47:08,950
...that the Mafia has
laid off five judges.

1050
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:14,960
I'm going to look around,
then come back for her.

1051
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,300
No more carrots.

1052
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:21,070
Did you like the couple that just won?

1053
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:24,140
Did you ever see a woman on
sound that looked like that?

1054
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:26,600
She must have been the boom girl.

1055
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:30,140
Looked like the bada-bing-bada-boom
girl right there.

1056
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,680
If she's working sound, who's listening?

1057
01:47:32,990 --> 01:47:34,210
Lighting change.

1058
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:37,980
And he was eloquent: "It's the
most happiest day of my life."

1059
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:41,790
Bet his mother was very
most proudest of him then.

1060
01:47:41,990 --> 01:47:43,150
20 seconds.

1061
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:48,330
Hi, Frank. How are you?

1062
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:49,790
Why're you here?

1063
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,340
-On the job.
-Who?

1064
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:55,160
Him.

1065
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:57,240
Short-term gig, but...

1066
01:47:58,110 --> 01:47:59,340
...profitable.

1067
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:04,720
Frank, I'm sorry about Miami.

1068
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:08,650
Cue music.

1069
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:11,550
Cue dancers.

1070
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:21,130
Back to work.

1071
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,690
See you at the Governor's ball.

1072
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,870
She sounds great.

1073
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:40,610
I want her run out of town.

1074
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,080
She must go!

1075
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:44,420
Tony, you there?

1076
01:48:46,130 --> 01:48:47,180
Tony?

1077
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:52,590
I have a feeling this is the night.
He'll go for her on camera.

1078
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:54,030
That's crazy!

1079
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:58,140
That's how he wants it to look;
but he's not crazy, he's very clever.

1080
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:00,860
Listen, I need you to help me tonight.

1081
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:04,440
You can't use that thing.
There's bad breakthrough.

1082
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:06,310
I must disconnect you.

1083
01:49:07,450 --> 01:49:08,440
I'll do it.

1084
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:12,510
You get it back after the show.

1085
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:25,650
What's wrong?

1086
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:27,130
Ready to go?

1087
01:49:28,230 --> 01:49:29,460
Shall we go?

1088
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,530
Gentlemen, is this necessary?
Must we have everyone?

1089
01:49:32,710 --> 01:49:35,170
We have our own man at the door!

1090
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:36,700
Please.

1091
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:39,400
No, I want him.

1092
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:43,470
Fine.

1093
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:47,480
Stay alert.

1094
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,650
Let us brighten this firmament.

1095
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:12,440
Coming through, please.
How much time do we have?

1096
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:14,500
Resetting staircases.

1097
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:17,380
Scenery coming in.

1098
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,110
30 seconds to lighting change.

1099
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:27,760
30 seconds. Don't panic.
Clear this area, please.

1100
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:35,760
Rachel, up, to the right and through.

1101
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:41,130
Clive, up, to the left and through.
You'll meet on the landing.

1102
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:45,030
Watch your step going down.
Somebody spilled water.

1103
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:50,140
Shall we?

1104
01:50:58,620 --> 01:51:01,890
Do try to relax. I know
you must be very excited.

1105
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:03,620
Thank you.

He's England's knight in shining armor.

01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:18,000
She's America's queen of the night.

1110
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:21,700
Please welcome Clive
Healy and Rachel Marron.

1111
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:51,170
Well, Rachel....

1112
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:55,800
I know you only came to present this
award and you'll leave when we're done.

1113
01:52:05,190 --> 01:52:09,090
No, I'm very interested in
one of the awards tonight.

1114
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:10,550
Best Actor.

1115
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:17,600
Tonight we heard 5 songs and
the names of their creators.

1116
01:52:25,010 --> 01:52:28,950
No matter what anyone thinks.
I know you have no personal favorites.

1117
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:32,480

All right, Clive, let's find out...

1124
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:13,890
...who the winner is.

1125
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:16,990
The envelope. Rachel,

1126
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:30,210
And the winner is:
" I Have Nothing"...

1127
01:53:30,310 --> 01:53:33,370
...from "Queen of the Night"

1128
01:53:40,190 --> 01:53:41,680
She's good, Frank.

1129
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:46,620
I'm okay.

1130
01:53:47,290 --> 01:53:48,780
I always said she was nuts.

1131
01:53:49,290 --> 01:53:50,850
I'm okay, all right?

1132
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:54,300
You're making me
into a raving lunatic!

1133
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:56,890
God!

1134
01:53:58,300 --> 01:53:59,290
You okay?

1135
01:53:59,470 --> 01:54:00,700
Yes!

1136
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:03,200
Fucking actresses!

1137
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:06,470
-Where's Portman?
-Who?

1138
01:54:06,650 --> 01:54:08,580
-Portman.
-Never heard of him.

1139
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:19,650
I'm sorry, but if you want to be in your
seat for Best Actress, you must go now.

1140
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:23,790
I'm going as fast as I can. Why don't
you go twitch somewhere else?

1141
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:26,430
Everything's fine. No one noticed.

1142
01:54:26,730 --> 01:54:30,130
-Everyone's jumping out of their skins.
-Bullshit.

1143
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:32,670
Farmer's making me into a lunatic!

1144
01:54:32,810 --> 01:54:35,140
-You should know--
-You're driving her crazy!

1145
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:37,070
I know who it is.

1146
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:39,140
-Shut up!
-He's here tonight!

1147
01:54:39,610 --> 01:54:43,980
You're a maniac! You've embarrassed
me in front of billions of people.

1148
01:54:46,350 --> 01:54:49,080
-Wait for Frank. Honey, please.
-Three minutes!

1149
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:50,810
Calm the fuck down!

1150
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:52,510
Is he coming?

1151
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,360
I know who it is.

1152
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:00,520
Portman.

1153
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:03,170
Remember? The guy in Miami.

1154
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:06,690
-Oh, yeah, the pencil neck!
-ls anyone coming with me?

1155
01:55:06,940 --> 01:55:10,840
After tonight, you're in charge.
He knows nothing about show business.

1156
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:13,000
Two minutes to Best Actress.

1157
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:16,540
You're an asshole.

1158
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:20,280
To present the Best Actress award...

1159
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:25,650
...we have the man who last year, won
for his performance in "South of Waco"...

1160
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:28,780
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Mr. Tom Winston.

1161
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:41,500
Thank you, Academy.

1162
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:43,670
Did you see him?

1163
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:47,740
-Go to the other side of the stage.
-What do I do?

1164
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:50,040
See those people?

1165
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:51,980
They don't need to be there.

1166
01:55:52,150 --> 01:55:54,140
That guy with the camera too.

1167
01:55:54,690 --> 01:55:56,520
I'll take care of it.

1168
01:55:59,830 --> 01:56:02,160
Rachel Marron for "Queen of the Night."

1169
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:16,330
You!

1170
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:21,340
Rachel Marron!

1171
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:23,610
"Queen of the Night."

1172
01:57:40,690 --> 01:57:42,160
Go to commercial.

1173
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:43,920
He's got a gun!

1174
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:45,130
He's got a gun!

1175
01:57:47,170 --> 01:57:48,260
Get the gun!

1176
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:16,190
-She's bleeding!
-It's not me!

1177
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:19,820
He's my bodyguard!

1178
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,570
Frank! Stay with me!

1179
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:35,470
Stay with me! Come on.

1180
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:38,480
God, hurry up!

1181
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:56,350
How's it going?

1182
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:58,730
It's under control.

1183
01:59:59,730 --> 02:00:01,720
It won't be the same without you.

1184
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:04,830
How you doing?

1185
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:20,980
You shouldn't be here.

1186
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:25,150
So you're quitting show business?

1187
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,850
Too bad. You had talent.

1188
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:35,560
Fletcher, go to the plane.

1189
02:00:39,570 --> 02:00:40,940
How's the new guy?

1190
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:45,110
He's got white hair.

1191
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:50,410
-He's very good.
-But did you have to get me an old man?

1192
02:00:51,350 --> 02:00:53,150
I don't trust you.

1193
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:10,300
Let's get this over with,
okay? Give me a kiss.

1194
02:01:17,210 --> 02:01:18,510
Goodbye, Rachel.

1195
02:01:20,210 --> 02:01:21,800
'Bye, Frank.

1196
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:33,050
If I should stay

1197
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:40,530
I would only...

1198
02:01:41,470 --> 02:01:42,690
...be in...

1199
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:45,690
...your way

1200
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:50,470
So I'll go.

1201
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:52,010
You okay?

1202
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,640
But I know...

1203
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,540
...I'll think of you.

1204
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,550
Every step of...

1205
02:02:02,020 --> 02:02:03,850
...the way

1206
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:11,480
Wait!

1207
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:23,370
And I will always love you

1208
02:02:40,690 --> 02:02:42,680
You, my darling you

1209
02:02:47,700 --> 02:02:49,290
Bittersweet...

1210
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:52,760
...memories

1211
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:56,900
That is all...

1212
02:02:57,140 --> 02:02:59,770
...I'm taking with me

1213
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:03,780
So goodbye.

1214
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:07,620
Please don't cry.

1215
02:03:09,090 --> 02:03:10,920
We both know...

1216
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:14,090
...I'm not what you need

1217
02:03:22,030 --> 02:03:24,930
And I will always love you

1218
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:40,350
Our speaker this evening has
been a lone courageous voice.

1219
02:03:40,650 --> 02:03:45,110
He alone has challenged those
who have linked organized crime...

1220
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:48,520
...with legitimate business
throughout our state.

1221
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:50,660
Welcome, Congressman.

1222
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:02,610
First our benediction will be delivered
by the Reverend Phillip Hardy...

1223
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:06,540
...of the First Presbyterian
Church of lowa Rapids.

1224
02:04:10,850 --> 02:04:12,610
Heavenly Father...

1225
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:16,780
...please bless us today as we
meet in friendship and duty.

1226
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:21,490
And, Lord, whatever dangerous
endeavors those among us may take...

1227
02:04:21,630 --> 02:04:24,560
...Iet them never be
without Your sanctuary.

1228
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:27,220
We know in our hearts...

1229
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:30,800
...that though we may pass through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1230
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,700
...You are with us...

1231
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:35,500
...guiding and protecting us.

1232
02:04:36,570 --> 02:04:37,800
Amen.

1233
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000


1234
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
