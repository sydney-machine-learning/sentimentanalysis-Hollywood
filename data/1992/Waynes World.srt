1
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,489
Spend all day with us.
There are two - you heard me -

2
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:34,493
two of everything
in every Noah's Arcade.

3
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:39,331
That means two of Zantar,
Bay Wolf, Ninja Commando,

4
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,375
Snake-azon, Psycho Chopper...

5
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,502
It's good seeing you, Benjamin.

6
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,213
You haven't been to Shakey's
for so long.

7
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,090
Well, I've been real busy.

8
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,051
It's two for you cos one won't do.

9
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,304
All this week,
kids under six get every fifth...

10
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:58,517
There's a new pet.
Chia Pet, the pottery that grows...

11
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,728
..they are very fast.

12
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,149
..simple. Plug it in,
insert the plug from anything.

13
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,442
Simple.

14
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,737
..even for our customers
in Waukegan, Elgin and Aurora,

15
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,489
we'll be there right on time.

16
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,907
So call!

17
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,672
- All right! Excellent!
- Excellent.

18
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,176
OK. Extreme close-up!

19
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,936
- Excellent.
- Excellent extreme close-up.

20
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,773
Now it's Wayne's World's Totally
Amazing Excellent Discoveries.

21
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:50,485
Our guest is Ron Paxton.
Welcome to Wayne's World, Ron.

22
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,862
Thanks, Wayne.

23
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,073
Now, you're the inventor
of the Suck Kut, right?

24
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,658
What exactly is it?

25
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,703
The Suck Kut is a revolution
in home hair cutting.

26
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,248
Wow! What a totally amazing
excellent discovery.

27
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,583
Well, yes.

28
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,669
Fireworks!

29
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,092
Now, Ron, the question on everybody's
mind is, how does it work?

30
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,929
I'm prepared for
a complete demonstration.

31
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:21,016
OK, Garth, sit there. He's gonna
put that thing on your melon, OK?

32
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,227
Just a trim. Don't buzz me, OK?

33
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,528
So tell me, Ron.
Exactly how does the Suck Kut work?

34
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,823
Well, as you can see,
it sucks as it cuts.

35
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,284
It certainly does suck.

36
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,789
What are we looking at?

37
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,542
Wayne's World.
They do it from their basement.

38
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,674
- People watch this?
- Yeah, lots.

39
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,511
Turn it off, man! Turn it off!
It's sucking my will to live!

40
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,513
Oh, the humanity!

41
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,726
- You want to hand me the telephone?
- Sure.

42
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,023
Russell? It's Benjamin.
Are you watching TV?

43
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,776
Listen, could you turn it
to channel 10?

44
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,489
I want you to find out who these guys
are and where they do their show.

45
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,867
I think we can sell it to Vanderhoff.

46
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,577
Take your Ritalin, OK?

47
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,246
- OK, you're in a forest.
- Forest?

48
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,248
With Heather Locklear.

49
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,251
- With Heather?
- And you're very warm. Very...

50
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,502
- ..warm?
- Warm.

51
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:34,464
- These guys are so funny.
- Oh, they're obviously brilliant.

52
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:45,100
Wow! What a totally amazing
excellent discovery...not!

53
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,310
Thanks, Ron.

54
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,814
OK, time's up for this week.
Until then, good night!

55
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,317
- Party on, Wayne.
- Party on, Garth.

56
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,036
And...we're clear!

57
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,954
- All right!
- Excellent!

58
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,709
- All right! Excellent!
- Excellent!

59
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,755
Let me bring you up to speed.
My name is Wayne Campbell.

60
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,926
I live in Aurora, Illinois,
which is a suburb of Chicago.

61
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,344
Excellent.

62
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,304
I've had plenty of joe jobs.

63
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:27,309
Nothing I'd call a career.
Let me put it this way...

64
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,438
I have an extensive collection
of name tags and hairnets.

65
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:39,530
OK, I still live with my parents,
which I admit is both bogus and sad,

66
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,533
but I've got an amazing
cable access show,

67
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,535
and I still know how to party.

68
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,330
But what I'd really love
is to do Wayne's World for a living.

69
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,790
It might happen.

70
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,334
Sh'yeah, and monkeys might
fly out of my butt.

71
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,253
Ah, the mirthmobile.

72
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,804
This is my best friend Garth Algar.

73
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,055
Hi.

74
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,809
I think a little Bohemian Rhapsody,
gentlemen.

75
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,269
Good call.

76
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,095
Whoa! It's Phil.

77
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:54,813
Phil, what are you doing here?
You're partied out, man...again.

78
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:59,234
- What if he honks in the car?
- I'm giving you a no-honk guarantee.

79
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:07,284
Phil, um, if you're gonna spew,
spew into this.

80
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,470
- Garth, pull over.
- Oh, man! Come on!

81
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,138
Not again.

82
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:18,772
He does this every Friday.
Stop torturing yourself, man!

83
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:22,943
You'll never afford it!
Live in the now!

84
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,158
It will be mine.
Oh, yes... It will be mine.

85
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:13,118
Hey, Wayne's World!
Wayne's World! Party!

86
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,499
Excellent! Way to go!

87
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,085
Party on, Wayne!

88
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,510
Hey, Campbell. Uno momento, fellas.

89
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,804
Officer Koharski, how's it going?

90
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,473
Fine.

91
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:38,018
Say, I smell bacon.
Does anyone else smell bacon?

92
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,897
Yeah, I definitely smell
a pork product of some type.

93
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,316
Yeah, yeah. I know what you're doing.

94
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,737
Bacon, pig, oink-oink,
police officer.

95
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,073
I said that to cops
when I was your age.

96
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,659
Hey, what are you up to?

97
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,496
I just pulled over a tour bus
on its way to Chicago.

98
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,916
We had a tip there was some
drug smuggling going down.

99
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,584
We searched the vehicle.

100
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,838
It was clean,
so we did the body cavity searches.

101
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,756
- No way.
- Way!

102
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,843
I inspected 1 2, inside and out.

103
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:19,226
OK, this guy needs coffee
and crullers stat!

104
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,937
We got to get him to rampart.
Let's go!

105
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:29,111
This is Stan Mikita's Donuts.
Excellent munch post.

106
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,366
This is the manager, Glen.
He's here 24 hours a day.

107
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:38,579
I recommend the sugar pucks.
They're excellent. Come on.

108
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:42,416
I'd never done a crazy
thing in my life before that night.

109
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,253
Why is it if a man kills another
in battle it's called heroic,

110
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,339
yet in the heat of passion
it's called murder?

111
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,050
Hello! What do you think
you're doing?

112
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:55,679
Only me and Garth get
to talk to the camera. Come on.

113
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:01,268
I don't really have too much
to say right now.

114
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,978
What's that?

115
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,857
Hi, Mr Withers.
How's the amusement park?

116
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,568
Just great, Wayne.

117
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,155
Four coffees
and a half dozen crullers, please.

118
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,781
And one jelly donut.

119
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,412
There's your girlfriend, Garth.
Sh'yeah!

120
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,520
Excuse me. I fell.

121
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:48,607
Don't you guys ever get tired of
ordering the same thing?

122
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,859
No.

123
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,862
- Uh-oh. Don't look. Stacy.
- Where?

124
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,116
Oh, God. I made eye contact.

125
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,077
Psycho hose beast.

126
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,042
Happy anniversary, Wayne.

127
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:11,213
- Stacy, we broke up two months ago.
- It doesn't mean we can't go out.

128
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,883
Well, it does, actually.
That's what breaking up is.

129
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,052
You going to the Gasworks tonight?

130
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,679
- No!
- No!

131
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,807
Don't you wanna open your present?

132
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,393
If it's a severed head,
I'll be very upset.

133
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,980
- Open it.
- OK. OK.

134
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,987
- What is it?
- It's a gun rack.

135
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,117
A gun rack? A gun rack.
Sh'yeah, great.

136
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,119
I don't even own a gun,

137
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,289
let alone many guns
necessitating an entire rack.

138
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,917
What am I gonna do with a gun rack?

139
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,920
You don't like it? Fine.

140
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,800
Wayne, if you're not careful,
you're gonna lose me.

141
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,094
I lost you two months ago.

142
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:02,848
Are you mental? We broke up.
Get the net!

143
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,534
- Wayne!
- Hey!

144
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,287
How you doing? Garth!

145
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,789
Hey, Tiny, who's playing tonight?

146
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,334
Jolly Green Giants, Shitty Beatles.

147
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,086
The Shitty Beatles?
Are they any good?

148
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,507
- They suck.
- Then it's not just a clever name?

149
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,883
Who else?

150
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,219
Crucial Taunt, just finishing.

151
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,388
- I hear they can wail.
- You're right. Party on.

152
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,140
Party on.

153
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,364
This is the Gasworks,
an excellent heavy metal bar.

154
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,825
- Always a babefest.
- And they got a pool table, too.

155
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,543
Party! Excuse me.

156
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,509
Excuse me.

157
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,553
Excuse me.

158
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,805
- What?
- I'd like to get by now.

159
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,183
Get out of my face, you little dweeb.

160
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,398
Excuse me.

161
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,903
What do you want, you little dweeb?

162
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,540
Thank you.

163
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,221
She's a babe!

164
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,396
Fight! Fight! Fight!

165
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,325
All right.

166
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,080
I love this woman.

167
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:00,002
Hey, Raymond,
club soda with a lime, please.

168
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,879
And would you get me a towel?

169
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:05,465
- Boy, you really wail.
- Thanks.

170
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,886
You're that party time guy on TV.
Wayne, right?

171
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,262
Yes, and you are?

172
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,181
Cassandra.

173
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:15,517
Rough night, huh?
Everybody's kung fu fighting.

174
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,689
Yeah. Well, nice meeting you.

175
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,025
Hey, hold on!
Can I call you sometime?

176
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,068
For $5, come to the rent party.

177
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,738
- It's at my loft.
- I'm there.

178
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,784
I gotta go. The owner's
trying to dick me out of some money.

179
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,123
See how many people I brought in?

180
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,334
That bass player's a babe.

181
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,170
She makes me feel kind of funny,

182
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:47,132
like when we used to climb the rope
in gym class.

183
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,801
You said I get cash up front.

184
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:55,015
She will be mine.
Oh, yes... She will be mine.

185
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,239
Pardon me.
Do you have any Grey Poupon?

186
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,139
Garth, sit there.
He's gonna put that on your melon.

187
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,393
OK, just a trim.
Don't buzz me, OK?

188
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,444
Russell, stop the tape.

189
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,989
So, what do you think?

190
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,742
I think it's two chimps
on a davenport in a basement.

191
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,661
I'm not sponsoring this.

192
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,123
I got spots on Love Boat, but this?
What is this?

193
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,834
Mr Vanderhoff, this is your audience.

194
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,503
The same kids that line up
at Noah's Arcade.

195
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:09,256
- It looks so cheesy.
- That's where I come in.

196
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:13,594
Russell's our best producer. He does
Chicago PM with Elaine Ronkey,

197
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,763
Sunshine Saturday,
The African American Digest.

198
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,807
- Never heard of that.
- It's on late.

199
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,225
It won several awards.

200
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,394
Well, I'll stick with Love Boat.

201
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:26,815
If I may, speaking
from a producer-director standpoint,

202
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,942
kids can relate to this show.

203
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,861
These guys aren't phonies.

204
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,322
Kids can spot phonies.
They're very smart.

205
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,200
Kids know dick.
I watch 'em in my arcades.

206
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:40,787
They stand like lab rats hitting
the feeder bar to get food pellets.

207
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,166
As long as they pump in quarters,
who gives a shit?

208
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,835
Let me ask you.

209
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,714
What's your single biggest problem
in the arcade business?

210
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:55,052
Well, uh, keeping the customer
informed of new product.

211
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,346
Like our new game called Zantar.

212
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:01,141
Zantar is a gelatinous cube
that eats warriors in a village.

213
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,894
If you eat a chieftain,
you go up a level.

214
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,647
Beauty is, you can't
get to the next level,

215
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,774
kids keep coughing up quarters.

216
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,445
Gelatinous cube eats village.
It's terrific.

217
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:16,907
I know nothing about video games.
I found that riveting.

218
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,952
- I do my own commercials.
- I did not know that.

219
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,703
I don't mention the games

220
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:25,457
because the technology moves
faster than the advertising.

221
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,252
I did not realise that.
Russell, did you?

222
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,878
No, I did not realise that.

223
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:34,550
So, Mr Vanderhoff, let me see
if I'm hearing you correctly.

224
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:38,595
Are you saying that if you had a
spot, say, on a weekly show,

225
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,389
you could come on the show

226
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:43,809
and update the kids
on what was new in your arcade?

227
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,728
Yeah, that's it.

228
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,189
- Well, I'm impressed.
- Wow!

229
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:54,695
Noah's Arcade presents Wayne's World.
I think that's brilliant.

230
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,113
Brilliant.

231
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,741
- Well, thank you.
- We'll get right to work on this.

232
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:03,495
We'll send the contracts over.
We'll be in touch.

233
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,832
Well... I'd like to think about this.

234
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:10,878
Oh, of course you would.
I wouldn't have it any other way.

235
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,549
- She'll validate you.
- Thank you.

236
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,220
He's in.

237
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,646
Stop it! You're scaring me.

238
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,275
Oh, cool. You're learning
Cassandra's language.

239
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,945
I've never seen you so mental
over a girl before.

240
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,655
Are you gonna marry her?

241
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:42,326
Marriage is punishment
for shoplifting in some countries.

242
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:45,746
- OK, you passed inspection.
- All right.

243
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,498
Just barely.

244
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,001
Uh, OK, that's $42.57, Wayne -
parts and labour.

245
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,628
- No way.
- Brutal.

246
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,714
- Oh, OK. There you go.
- All right, we got it.

247
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,466
- That's not enough.
- What?

248
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:01,053
- We got...that.
- That's good, but I need more.

249
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:05,265
- Oh, man! Why don't you use a gun?
- It's not my fault. Come on.

250
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:09,228
- I suppose it's society's fault?
- More.

251
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,314
- Cool.
- All right.

252
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,942
Well, here's an extra dollar.

253
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,364
You guys shoulda been
at Gasworks Friday.

254
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:23,367
- Yeah, we were.
- This band, Crucial Taunt,

255
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,245
they had this megababe
lead singer...unreal!

256
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:30,290
Phil, we were there.
Have you gone mental? Hello?

257
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,418
- I think we should go now.
- Here you go.

258
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,064
You think it's wise
to sell a show we don't own?

259
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:57,442
- By tonight, we will.
- Ah!

260
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:07,161
Excuse me. Do you know where
we could find Wayne Campbell?

261
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:11,707
- That's privileged information.
- Where do they broadcast from?

262
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,711
- Are you a friend or a relative?
- We're neither.

263
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:20,757
You know, Russell,
I may not have grown up around here,

264
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,968
but I understand these people.

265
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:25,721
This must be the place.

266
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,561
OK, we're just about
out of time, right?

267
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,230
But let's give
a Wayne's World salute

268
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:37,774
to the Guess? jeans girl,
Claudia Schiffer.

269
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:44,198
- Tent pole! She's a babe.
- She's magically babelicious.

270
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,075
She tested very high
on the strokability scale.

271
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:53,874
Are you through yet?
I'm getting tired of holding this.

272
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,834
Yeah, that's what she said.

273
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:01,507
OK, so Claudia Schiffer,
we salute you.

274
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:05,886
OK, that's all, good night.

275
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,639
- Party on, Wayne.
- Party on, Garth.

276
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,191
And...we're clear.

277
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:22,653
- OK. Excellent show, everyone.
- Excellent.

278
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:26,615
Great show. Wayne, Benjamin Kane.

279
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:30,494
Regional Programme Director,
Oliver Communications.

280
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:32,746
Russell Findley. We spoke today. Hi.

281
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,624
Maybe we can go somewhere
and get acquainted?

282
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,961
Russell, get to know the crew.
You know anywhere nice?

283
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,505
- Hi. Hi.
- See you guys later!

284
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,719
Let me get this out of the way...

285
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:50,639
- I'm a big fan.
- You are?

286
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:54,351
The way I see it,
your show's capable of so much more.

287
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,604
We'll try harder, OK?
Give us a second chance.

288
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:00,357
Don't cancel us
without a second chance.

289
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,360
Garth, come on, relax, all right?
Your pills?

290
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,488
He can't cancel us.
We're on public access.

291
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:09,950
Can I be honest?
My job, it's usually such a bore.

292
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:13,120
But the other day something
incredible happened.

293
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,414
- What happened?
- Noah Vanderhoff,

294
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:19,668
owner of the largest video arcade
chain in Chicago, is in my office.

295
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:23,839
He asks me, "What's with this
Wayne's World I hear so much about?"

296
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:28,260
Well, I have all your shows on tape.
Like I said, I'm a fan.

297
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,597
I put a show in.
He literally jumped out of his seat.

298
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,723
Cool!

299
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:36,685
He wants to sponsor the show,
put you on our station,

300
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,729
and pay you guys a huge salary.

301
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:42,608
He doesn't realise you're artists,
not interested in money.

302
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:46,612
- No, we're not interested in money.
- That's what I told him.

303
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:51,200
But he said, "Take two cheques anyway
so they know I'm serious."

304
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:56,205
I may be wasting my time,
but here I am with the contract

305
00:24:56,288 --> 00:25:00,792
and two cashier's cheques
for $5,000 each.

306
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:03,754
Exsqueeze me? Baking powder?

307
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:07,090
You're going to pay us
for doing Wayne's World?

308
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,968
Give me the word.
I'll tear up these cheques.

309
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,307
He shoots, he scores!

310
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,894
Well. Would you like
to look at the contracts?

311
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:20,938
- Yes.
- Do you have a lawyer?

312
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:24,525
Yes. Uh...no.
We're between lawyers right now.

313
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:27,903
Our first lawyer
screwed our affairs so badly.

314
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,071
That's right.

315
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:33,909
I walked right into that office,
I grabbed him by his big fat head,

316
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:37,704
and I said, "I'm not going to jail
for you or anybody!"

317
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,998
Exactly.

318
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:45,170
Can I peruse that contract
before we sign it?

319
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:53,136
Yes... Yes.

320
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,556
I like what you've done here.

321
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,601
Yes... Yes...

322
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,603
I dropped my pen.

323
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:06,567
I'm not so sure about...
Oh, I see. I see.

324
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,362
Hi. Um, does this seem weird?
Why does he have contracts?

325
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:13,949
Ever see the Twilight Zone
where the guy signed a contract

326
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:17,035
and they cut out his tongue
and it wouldn't die,

327
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,747
it grew and pulsated
and gave birth to baby tongues?

328
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:25,878
- Pretty cool, huh? I gotta go.
- Oh, I like this part.

329
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:29,715
Well, I feel we can work with you
on this project.

330
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:33,385
Well, you've made Mr Vanderhoff
a very happy man.

331
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:40,184
- To Wayne's World.
- To Wayne's World.

332
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:43,854
We got $5,000, we got $5,000

333
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:47,774
We got $5,000, we got $5,000...

334
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,776
Hey, Wayne. Check it out.

335
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,530
We got $5,000, we got $5,000

336
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,544
Party!

337
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,175
Great party, huh, guys?

338
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,686
Uh-oh. Stacy alert!

339
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:31,026
We've been spotted and we're being
pulled in by her tractor beam.

340
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,028
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go!

341
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,861
God, she's amazing.

342
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:20,200
Wayne, Wayne,
Garth told me about the show, man.

343
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,452
I love you, man.

344
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,663
Yeah, and I love you, too, Terry.

345
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:27,833
No, I mean it, man. I love you.

346
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:32,629
- No, I mean it. I love you.
- No, you don't, man.

347
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:40,429
Garth, come over here! I think
Terry has something to say to you.

348
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,848
I love you, man.

349
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,725
Thank you.

350
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:23,096
Your vocals are incredible.

351
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,932
Thanks.

352
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,059
You have a very interesting look.

353
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:31,230
Oh, I'm not trying to pick up on you.

354
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:32,523
Good thing.

355
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:36,902
No, I'm producing a TV show.
It's in Chicago. Very late night.

356
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:42,866
We need a music act. Here's my card.
Is there a number I can reach you at?

357
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,118
We got fliers at the door.

358
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:52,125
Hello.

359
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:17,901
- Hi. Wanna go somewhere and talk?
- Sure.

360
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:30,372
- What's going on in there?
- Just a minute!

361
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:35,169
We'd like to go to the bathroom,
please...in this century.

362
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:39,464
- How long you been waiting?
- Like, an hour now.

363
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,428
- Hi, Garth.
- Hi.

364
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,013
I'm looking for Wayne.

365
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:49,224
He seems to be going through
a difficult phase.

366
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:52,603
- You know what I think it is?
- That you're mental?

367
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:54,688
You know him best. What should I do?

368
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,899
Get over it.
Go out with somebody else.

369
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:58,942
Get over it.
Go out with somebody else.

370
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,652
Yeah, thanks. OK, great.

371
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:03,947
Hi.

372
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:07,701
So who's this guy Benjamin?

373
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:10,621
Only one of the most important
producers in TV.

374
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:13,874
He's way ahead of his time.
We've signed with him.

375
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:17,753
- He's based in Chicago.
- He's interested in the band.

376
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:20,756
Of course. I love your band.
You guys wail.

377
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,926
- Thanks.
- You kick ass. Double live gonzo!

378
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:26,512
Intensity in 10 cities.
Live at Budokan.

379
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:29,515
If you got a break,
you could make it.

380
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:33,060
And if a frog had wings,
he wouldn't bump his ass hopping.

381
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:37,481
Interesting.
Where did you learn English?

382
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:40,984
College.
And the Police Academy movies.

383
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:47,825
Cassandra...

384
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,828
I've got something
I want to say to you.

385
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,044
Campbell, that's amazing!

386
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:02,297
You learned to say I look pretty
in Cantonese.

387
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,052
And you are a handsome man.

388
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:12,182
Slowly, I'm still learning.

389
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:16,562
I can't get over it, you're learning
Cantonese. Even your accent is good.

390
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:20,357
- Hi, Wayne!
- Hello, Stacy.

391
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,568
Here, sit right here.

392
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:26,572
- Who is that?
- My ex-girlfriend.

393
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:35,205
She has very nice legs,
but no self-esteem.

394
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:40,544
The irony is,
I feel partly responsible

395
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:43,380
for her self-nullifying behaviour.

396
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:50,345
You're allowing yourself
to be victimised.

397
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:52,598
Have you been
effectively assertive?

398
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:56,727
I've made a confident declaration
in defence of my rights,

399
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,104
but it does not seem to do any good.

400
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:02,149
If I help her
out of feelings of obligation,

401
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,401
I may find myself resenting her.

402
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,945
Besides, she's a psycho hose beast.

403
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:12,618
That is very funny. But labelling
people can be dangerous.

404
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:18,123
Was it Kierkegaard
or Dick Van Patten who said,

405
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:23,253
"If you label me, you negate me?"

406
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,967
- You make me laugh.
- Can I call you?

407
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:30,928
Any time.

408
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,138
Excellent.

409
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,391
Look out!

410
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:26,775
Sometimes I wish I could boldly go
where no man's gone before.

411
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:29,403
But I'll probably stay in Aurora.

412
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:34,366
- What are you thinking about?
- Cassandra.

413
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,701
She's a fox.

414
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:38,328
In France, she'd be called la renard.

415
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:41,331
Hunted, with only her cunning
to protect her.

416
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:44,293
- She's a babe.
- She's a robo babe.

417
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:47,296
In Latin, she'd be called
Babia Majora.

418
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,382
If she were a president,
she'd be Baberaham Lincoln.

419
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:02,603
Did you find Bugs Bunny attractive
in a dress playing a girl bunny?

420
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:05,981
No.

421
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,030
No.

422
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:15,782
Neither did I. I was just asking.

423
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,953
OK. OK. Keep looking up!

424
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:21,079
OK.

425
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:48,774
Guys, I will be talking
to the cameramen on the headset.

426
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,901
Terry will give you hand cues.

427
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:55,113
Excuse me, Russell, but I believe
I requested the hand job.

428
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,578
Let's go on.
The cue is - watch carefully...

429
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:07,167
Five, four, three...

430
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,421
You didn't say two or one.

431
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:14,842
- You don't say two or one.
- Why not?

432
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:20,138
You just don't, OK? Now, it goes...

433
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:26,395
Five, four, three...

434
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:34,361
- Good! OK, good.
- Ow! All right!

435
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:38,073
Now, we're ready for rehearsal,
unless there are questions.

436
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:41,702
Yeah... Does this
seem weird to anybody else?

437
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:44,955
I mean, we're looking down
on Wayne's basement,

438
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,875
only that's not Wayne's basement.

439
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,085
Isn't that weird?

440
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:52,671
- That's twisted.
- That's weird, man.

441
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:55,174
Garth, that was a haiku.

442
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,845
- Control room.
- Russell.

443
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:03,348
- Hello, Benjamin.
- Finishing with the Vanderhoffs.

444
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:07,227
They'd like to visit rehearsal,
see we're not wasting their money.

445
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:11,940
Not...a good idea, sir.

446
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:13,275
Great!

447
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,653
Come in. Your landing gear is down.

448
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:18,780
- Just...put that down.
- Ow.

449
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:22,242
Just go away, guys. Go to the set.
Hey, hey, hey!

450
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:26,121
- He's excited you'll see the studio.
- Oh, the studio.

451
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:29,291
- That's where the magic happens.
- You work in TV?

452
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:33,253
- No, but I watch a lot.
- Of course you do. You're creative.

453
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,923
She came up with the name
Noah's Arcade.

454
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:38,800
I just opened my mouth
and out it came.

455
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:42,221
You're a lucky man, Mr Vanderhoff.

456
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:47,518
All right, can we bring in
the blue screen? Let's try one.

457
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:50,187
Ready to cue Wayne and Garth, and go.

458
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:55,150
- OK.
- In five, four, three...

459
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,113
Good, Terry.
Uh, Wayne, Garth, don't count along.

460
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:02,658
We see your mouths moving. Again.

461
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:05,744
In five, four, three...

462
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:09,873
Guys? You're nodding.
Once again, Terry.

463
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:15,003
In five, four, three, two...

464
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,507
Welcome to Wayne's World.

465
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,551
- Party on, Garth.
- Party on, Wayne.

466
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:22,678
A new feature on Wayne's World

467
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,681
allows us to travel
through time and space.

468
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:29,268
It's called chromakey,
and it's handy for going to...

469
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:30,602
New York.

470
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:34,690
- Hey, we're in New York!
- I got a gun. Let's hit Broadway.

471
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:37,860
- I guess kids get this?
- Oh, they love it.

472
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:40,404
Or maybe you prefer Hawaii.

473
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:45,159
Mookalakaheeki. Come on, you wanna
lei me. Pass the poi, Mahalo.

474
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,286
Or say you want to go to Texas.

475
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:51,123
Howdy, partners.
Let's raise and rope broncos.

476
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:54,209
- Let's go down.
- Howdy, y'all.

477
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:58,213
Or imagine being magically
whisked away to...

478
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:00,257
Delaware.

479
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,011
Hi. I'm in Delaware.

480
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:09,099
Noah and Mimi Vanderhoff, say hello
to Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar.

481
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:11,268
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

482
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,897
So, Garth, how do you like
being in a real studio?

483
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,066
It's like a new pair of underwear.

484
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,236
At first it's constrictive,

485
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,323
but after a while,
it becomes a part of you.

486
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,953
- I gotta go.
- OK. OK.

487
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,373
No, no, no. Please.

488
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:37,002
Wayne, I used to be in meat packing.
Lips and hooves.

489
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,797
One day, I had a four-hour layover
in Tulsa.

490
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:45,469
These airport kids kept pumping
quarters into a game called Pong.

491
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,513
They must've blown 50 bucks.

492
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:52,267
I sat there watching and I said,
"Hell, I'm in the wrong business."

493
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:55,437
15 years later, I'm a millionaire.

494
00:39:56,897 --> 00:40:00,234
- It's so huge!
- Thanks.

495
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:04,655
- Do I frighten you?
- No.

496
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:06,740
Do you want me to?

497
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:10,035
- Noah, I love you on that couch.
- You think?

498
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,246
Noah does all his own commercials.

499
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:15,499
Yeah, I got a new one where I rap.

500
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:18,377
Come bust a move
where the games are played

501
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,755
It's chill, it's fresh,
it's Noah's Arcade

502
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:24,925
What do you think of that?

503
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:26,593
I'd have to say...

504
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:30,681
- Asphinctersezwhat?
- What?

505
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:35,310
- A sphincter says what?
- What?

506
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:37,145
Exactly.

507
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:38,313
We've got a lunch.

508
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:41,233
- That's what I think of it.
- OK.

509
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,694
Well, it's been a pleasure.

510
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:46,029
May I say I've had a thrilling day.

511
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,573
- You may.
- Shall we?

512
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:49,449
And may I say your wife's a babe.

513
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:52,035
- Thank you.
- We have a table.

514
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,467
What is it, girl?

515
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:11,138
Aliens have kidnapped Wayne?

516
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:15,851
Oh, I misunderstood.
Wayne's outside. Thanks, girl.

517
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:25,444
OK! Game on!

518
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,572
- Game on!
- Game on!

519
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:34,286
He shoots, he scores!

520
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:37,164
- One for one!
- Crowd is going wild!

521
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:38,916
Car!

522
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:45,797
- Game on!
- Game on!

523
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:50,302
- OK.
- Let's go.

524
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:54,264
Worseley cuts down the angle.

525
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:57,976
- Gretzky shoots!
- Oh, Gretzky is denied!

526
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,853
Choked in the open net.

527
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:03,565
- Wayne?
- Yeah?

528
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:06,109
Do you feel Benjamin's not one of us?

529
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:10,280
Good call. It's as if Benjamin
wants us to be liked by everyone.

530
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:13,575
Led Zeppelin didn't write tunes
everyone liked.

531
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,577
They left that to the Bee Gees.

532
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:17,996
Car!

533
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,878
- Game on!
- Game on!

534
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:30,634
Uh-oh. Incoming. Stacy, ten o'clock.

535
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:32,386
Hi, Wayne.

536
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:35,264
Hi.

537
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:41,979
Hey, are you all right?

538
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:47,067
And she's OK!

539
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:51,905
- Game on!
- Yeah, game on!

540
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:11,842
You know, Garth, you and I
have never really talked.

541
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:15,345
OK.

542
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:18,265
You know, I love
what you do on the show.

543
00:43:18,348 --> 00:43:22,019
I look at you
and I just laugh and laugh.

544
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:24,021
Uh-huh.

545
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:27,733
Let me run this by you
because you're...a sharp guy.

546
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:31,445
I'm thinking about giving Vanderhoff
a weekly interview.

547
00:43:31,528 --> 00:43:34,198
How would you feel
about making a change?

548
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:35,657
We fear change.

549
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:56,553
Cassandra, I have to say it,
you look excellent.

550
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:59,306
Thanks. I've been so busy
with my band,

551
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:01,850
I thought I was getting meningitis.

552
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:04,520
I thought I had mono
for an entire year.

553
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:07,189
Turned out I was just really bored.

554
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,070
Excuse me?

555
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:16,365
I'm sorry. It's the last song
I heard this morning.

556
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:17,991
I hate when that happens.

557
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,339
I'm gonna put on some tunes.

558
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:37,386
- When did you get the CD player?
- When we got the money.

559
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:07,708
There it is...Excalibur.

560
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:13,922
'64 Fender Stratocaster with triple
single coil pickups and a whammy bar.

561
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:16,133
Pre-CBS Fender corporate buy-out.

562
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:19,845
I'd raise the bridge and
take the buzz out of the low E.

563
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:21,388
God, I love this woman.

564
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:24,808
- Hi, Garth.
- Hi.

565
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,226
Where's the clerk?

566
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:29,229
I know. I'll use
the "may I help you" riff.

567
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:36,069
May I help you?

568
00:45:36,153 --> 00:45:37,362
Yes, my good man.

569
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:40,240
I'd like to see this
Fender Stratocaster.

570
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:41,909
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

571
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:43,327
- Again?
- Yes.

572
00:45:59,718 --> 00:46:01,094
Be careful.

573
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:12,940
No Stairway. Denied!

574
00:46:56,358 --> 00:47:00,612
Wow. You're...amazing, dude.

575
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:03,282
Thanks. I like to play.

576
00:47:07,536 --> 00:47:09,705
Excuse me. Wayne?

577
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:12,416
Can I put
the Fender back now, please?

578
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:15,460
Not today, my good man.
I'm feeling saucy.

579
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:18,797
I think I'm gonna buy it.
Do you accept...cash? Cha-ching.

580
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:31,602
Have you spoken to Wayne
about the Vanderhoff spot?

581
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:35,063
Yes. Briefly.
He was not very receptive.

582
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:36,523
Oh, really?

583
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:39,818
Well, I'll explain
that it's in his contract.

584
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:44,156
Oh. Well, Wayne will understand
that right away.

585
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:45,949
Not!

586
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:49,495
Excuse me.

587
00:47:49,578 --> 00:47:53,916
I mean, there's two Darrin Stevens,
Dick York, Dick Sargent.

588
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:57,503
Sh'yeah! Right!
As if we wouldn't notice.

589
00:47:57,586 --> 00:47:58,837
Well, hold on.

590
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:03,300
Dick York, Dick Sargent,
Sergeant York. Wow, that's weird.

591
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:10,641
Wayne. Listen, we need to have
a talk about Vanderhoff.

592
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:12,643
The fact is, he's the sponsor.

593
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:16,230
You signed a contract
guaranteeing him concessions,

594
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:17,856
like a spot on the show.

595
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,776
That's where I see things
differently.

596
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:24,071
Contract or no,
I will not bow to any sponsor.

597
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:29,827
I'm sorry you feel that way,
but it's the nature of the beast.

598
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,037
Maybe I'm wrong on this one,

599
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,666
but for me, the beast
doesn't include selling out.

600
00:48:38,794 --> 00:48:41,380
Garth, you know what I mean, right?

601
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:49,346
It's like people only do things
because they get paid,

602
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:51,348
and that's just really sad.

603
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:56,436
I can't talk about it any more.
It's giving me a headache.

604
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,188
Here. Take two of these.

605
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:02,025
Ah, Nuprin.

606
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:03,944
Little. Yellow. Different.

607
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:08,282
Look, you can stay here in the
big leagues and play by the rules

608
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:11,660
or go back to the farm club
in Aurora, your choice.

609
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:14,872
Yes. And it's the choice
of a new generation.

610
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:37,060
- Anything wrong, Davy?
- Yeah. I got paid today.

611
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:39,188
Oh, yeah, I know what that's like.

612
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:42,608
No. You don't understand.
They laid me off.

613
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:46,403
- I got one of these.
- Yeah. I know how that feels.

614
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:47,946
Know what I'd like to do?

615
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,532
Yeah, I know what you'd like to do.

616
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:54,661
Find the guy that did it,
rip his still-beating heart out,

617
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:58,999
and hold it in his face so he can
see how black it is before he dies.

618
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:02,836
Actually, I was gonna
file a grievance with the union.

619
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:06,381
Well, the world's a twisted place.

620
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:12,930
- Hi.
- How's it going, Garth?

621
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:15,015
Good.

622
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:19,478
Hey. There she is.

623
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:30,989
I must've slipped.

624
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:37,120
Wayne, what do you do if every time
you see this one incredible woman,

625
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:39,164
you think you're gonna hurl?

626
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:43,877
I say hurl. If you blow chunks
and she comes back, she's yours.

627
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:47,840
If you spew and she bolts,
it was never meant to be.

628
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:53,637
Oh, I'm not ready yet.
I gotta be comfortable with me first.

629
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,056
Why don't you talk to her?

630
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:06,710
Why don't you just go talk to her?
Go talk to her? Go talk to her?

631
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:10,297
Garth?

632
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:20,807
Camera one, camera two.
Camera one, camera two.

633
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:27,022
Don't.

634
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:34,446
Tell me,
when that first show is over,

635
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:38,617
will you still love me when
I'm an incredibly humongoid star?

636
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,910
Yeah.

637
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:43,205
And in my
hanging-out-with-Ravi-Shankar phase?

638
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:44,540
Yeah.

639
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:49,378
And in my sequin-jumpsuit,
young-girls-in-white-cotton-panties,

640
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:51,922
waking-up-in-a-pool-of-vomit,

641
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:55,259
bloated-purple-dead-on-a-toilet
phase?

642
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:58,554
- Yeah.
- OK. Party. Bonus.

643
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,349
Yeah? Oh, hi, Anthony.

644
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:05,310
- Who's Anthony? Who's Anthony?
- My drummer.

645
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:06,603
OK.

646
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:08,522
You what?

647
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:12,317
No, I told you next week
we'll be doing a music video.

648
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:18,115
Do you mind? This is business.

649
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,036
Hey, you wanna be a busboy
the rest of your life?

650
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,330
Well, then, talk to your boss.

651
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:34,089
Look, this guy Benjamin's putting up
serious money for this. Yeah.

652
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:37,426
Happy birthday

653
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,845
Mr President

654
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:43,390
Happy birthday

655
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:45,726
To you

656
00:53:48,562 --> 00:53:52,649
Work it out, OK? Just...
No, just be there.

657
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:54,443
OK, bye.

658
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:56,320
You asshole!

659
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:06,663
Excellent.

660
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:24,765
Hey. All right.
Glad you could make it.

661
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:27,100
Yes!

662
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:30,312
- Cool.
- Yes.

663
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:35,275
This is definitely what I'm gonna get
when I move out of my parents' house.

664
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,237
- Oh, you have a terrace!
- Yeah. Go on out.

665
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,239
I'll get the Dom Perignon.

666
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:46,870
What floor is this?

667
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:49,373
Um...the 23rd.

668
00:54:55,254 --> 00:55:00,008
You know, Cassandra...
from this height...

669
00:55:00,092 --> 00:55:02,678
you could really
hawk a lugie on someone.

670
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:10,185
You know, I feel so free up here!

671
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:12,896
Costs a lot to live this free.

672
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,982
This might be a tangent

673
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:18,235
but it's something
I've been thinking about...

674
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:19,820
Hi.

675
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:23,365
If Cassandra was my girl,
I wouldn't bring her here.

676
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:28,662
I mean, look at this place.
This is a fully functional babe lair.

677
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:31,498
Chicks are helpless
against its powers.

678
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:33,083
Let's check it out.

679
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:36,003
I don't believe
I've had French champagne.

680
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:39,673
Actually, all champagne is French,
after the region.

681
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:42,301
Otherwise, it's sparkling white wine.

682
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:44,887
Americans ignore the convention,

683
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:49,224
so they call their sparkling
whites champagne, though they're not.

684
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:52,895
Ah, yes. It's a lot like
Star Trek: The Next Generation.

685
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:57,274
It's often superior, but will never
be as recognised as the original.

686
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:03,280
Aha. What's this?
"How To Pick Up Chicks".

687
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:05,824
"How To Meet Women". He's smooth.

688
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:13,290
"Daily reminder...Thursday.

689
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:18,086
"Purchase feeble public access cable
show and exploit it."

690
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:21,882
Whoa. I feel sorry
for whoever that is.

691
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:23,425
Let's look over here.

692
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:34,478
"Ribbed for her pleasure."

693
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,398
Well, the show looks great.

694
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:41,693
Mr Vanderhoff's excited.
I'm very excited.

695
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:46,073
I think the show's gonna be a
huge hit all over the Chicago area.

696
00:56:46,156 --> 00:56:47,366
For you and Garth -

697
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:50,828
tickets to Alice Cooper
tomorrow night in Milwaukee.

698
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:53,038
Backstage passes!

699
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:57,042
All-access backstage
with Alice Cooper?

700
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,920
- Thank you.
- Take the day off. Enjoy yourselves.

701
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:01,547
What about Cassandra?

702
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,340
She and I have work to do.

703
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:07,803
- Here's to your success.
- No. Here's to Benjamin.

704
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:18,147
Who wants Chinese takeout?
I know a great place.

705
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:21,066
I'll have the cream of sum yung guy.

706
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:26,697
Cassandra, why don't you order?

707
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,783
No. I'm sure whatever you order
will be fine.

708
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:31,326
Oh, OK.

709
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:52,514
This guy is good.

710
00:57:52,598 --> 00:57:55,475
Picked up a little Cantonese
in the Orient.

711
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,854
You sound more like Kowloon Bay
than Hong Kong.

712
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:01,106
I was born in Kowloon Bay.

713
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:02,733
There you have it.

714
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:05,319
This guy's really good.

715
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:56,912
Sounds great!

716
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:58,956
- Thanks.
- You got a minute?

717
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,291
Sure. Hey, you guys, hang out.

718
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:04,586
I came by to drop off
the contract for the video.

719
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:08,382
Oh, great. I never really got a
chance to say thank you.

720
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:12,344
- You've been very generous.
- It's been my pleasure.

721
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:16,390
Listen, if you're done, we could
spend the afternoon together.

722
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:23,147
We should be close
to Milwaukee by now.

723
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:35,075
- Look! There's Shotz brewery!
- Cool!

724
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:11,403
Hey, wait a minute.
What are we doin'?

725
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:14,573
Yeah! We got backstage passes
for Alice Cooper!

726
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:09,044
Do you want to go backstage?

727
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:13,882
Yeah. Let's go back now
and beat the crowd.

728
01:01:41,285 --> 01:01:42,619
Where you going?

729
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:43,996
Got a pass.

730
01:01:52,713 --> 01:01:57,509
Uh-oh. I think we took a wrong turn,
cos we're outside now.

731
01:01:57,593 --> 01:01:59,636
Whoa! Look!

732
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:04,433
Is this Alice's limo?

733
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:07,478
It belongs to Frank Sharp,
head of Sharp Records.

734
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:09,605
Good friend of Alice's.

735
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:13,609
Wow. That's, like, way bigger
than a normal size car.

736
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:17,196
Well, it has to be.
He drives everywhere.

737
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:20,240
Hates to fly. He's going across
the country right now

738
01:02:20,324 --> 01:02:23,118
to look for new acts
to sign to his label.

739
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:24,828
Next stop is St Louis.

740
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:29,082
Then he'll come back through Chicago
on his way to Detroit.

741
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:32,753
Thanks.

742
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:42,095
For a security guard, he had an awful
lot of information, don't you think?

743
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:47,142
Thank you, Milwaukee!

744
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,445
Whoa, whoa, ladies.
I'm sorry. No...

745
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:00,864
Oh, you got pass...
All right. Come on.

746
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:04,409
- Let us through, please!
- Can't let you in.

747
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:09,706
Alice. Is this cool?

748
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,667
Yeah. Come on in.

749
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,210
Sorry to bother you,

750
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:16,380
but we had to tell you
how much we enjoyed the show.

751
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:18,257
Didn't we, Garth?

752
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:21,260
Oh. Thanks.

753
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,596
We're not mental or anything,
so don't be afraid.

754
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,099
My name is Wayne and this is Garth.

755
01:03:28,142 --> 01:03:30,394
Nice to meet you guys.

756
01:03:30,477 --> 01:03:34,481
So do you...come to Milwaukee often?

757
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:37,860
Well, I'm a regular visitor,

758
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:41,613
but Milwaukee has certainly
had its share of visitors.

759
01:03:41,697 --> 01:03:45,242
French missionaries and explorers
came in the late 1600s

760
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:47,911
to trade with the Native Americans.

761
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:51,165
- Isn't Milwaukee an Indian name?
- Yes, Pete, it is.

762
01:03:51,248 --> 01:03:54,334
Actually, it's pronounced
mee-lee-wah-kay,

763
01:03:54,418 --> 01:03:56,628
Algonquin for "the good land".

764
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:58,505
I was not aware of that.

765
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:01,508
One of its most
interesting aspects is that

766
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:06,680
it's the only major American city to
have elected three socialist mayors.

767
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:09,475
Does this guy know how to party
or what?

768
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:16,440
OK. Well, we gotta get going.

769
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:18,567
No, stick around. Hang out with us.

770
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:24,907
Cool. Yeah, we'll stay and
hang around with you, us...

771
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,700
with Alice Cooper.

772
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:32,539
We're not worthy! We're not worthy!

773
01:04:32,623 --> 01:04:34,500
We're not worthy!

774
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:37,544
We're scum! We suck!

775
01:04:40,756 --> 01:04:44,301
Our first big show
and we almost didn't make it.

776
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:47,221
I really hope
Cassandra's watching.

777
01:04:49,223 --> 01:04:52,476
The couch works perfect. Hey.

778
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,646
- How's it going?
- Tonight's the night.

779
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:59,942
A lot of people in the Chicagoland
area will be watching the show.

780
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:02,653
You know what?
I know it's gonna be a hit.

781
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:05,113
I'll be in the booth.

782
01:05:05,197 --> 01:05:07,574
Mr Vanderhoff is your first guest.

783
01:05:07,658 --> 01:05:09,201
Oh, hi, boys.

784
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:11,161
What the hell is this?

785
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:13,789
Can we fly in the sign, please?

786
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:15,749
That's it. Bring her down.

787
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:18,919
Don't tense up. You'll be great.

788
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:21,755
Garth, have you got a second?

789
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:26,343
Simply read the cards.
You're going to be wonderful. Really.

790
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:28,220
OK?

791
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:31,306
Oh, Russell,
can I borrow your marker?

792
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:33,809
I, uh...need to make some notes.

793
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:36,061
Sure.

794
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:37,855
Good luck.

795
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:41,942
My guys. You're my guys!

796
01:05:47,156 --> 01:05:49,950
Your name is pronounced Algar, right?

797
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:53,328
OK. Wayne!

798
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:55,455
- He'll be fine.
- Good.

799
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,542
This is it, honey.

800
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:02,337
In five, four, three...

801
01:06:05,716 --> 01:06:09,094
Wayne's World is
brought to you by Noah's Arcade.

802
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:10,387
Party on, Wayne.

803
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:22,274
It's Friday. It's 1 1 :30.

804
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:26,445
It's time to party with
your excellent host Wayne Campbell,

805
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:28,530
and with him, as always, Garth.

806
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:31,533
Party on, Wayne, and party on, Garth.

807
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:37,164
OK. Welcome to Wayne's World.

808
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:40,292
- Party on, Garth.
- I guess.

809
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,752
OK. OK, first of all,

810
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:46,715
we'd like to take a moment
to welcome our sponsor.

811
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,469
He's the owner of a fine chain
of Noah's Arcades...

812
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:55,432
Noah Vanderhoff. Nice name...not!

813
01:06:55,516 --> 01:06:57,893
Now, uh, Mr Vanderhoff...

814
01:06:57,976 --> 01:07:00,062
He's using the cards. Yes!

815
01:07:00,145 --> 01:07:02,022
I told you he'd fall in line.

816
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:05,150
What is your most popular video game
right now?

817
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:07,945
Desert Storm Commando Warriors.

818
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:13,116
About that limited skirmish
in the Middle East?

819
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,284
Yes.

820
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:15,994
What the hell's he doing?

821
01:07:16,078 --> 01:07:19,373
Aren't there long lines
for the popular games?

822
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:22,626
Well, at Noah's arcade,
we like to say

823
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:25,587
there's two of everything,
so there's never a line.

824
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:29,716
OK. Now, Noah,
I've always wanted to know...

825
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,595
what is the difference between
Pac-Man and Ms Pac-Man, really?

826
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:35,556
Well, she has a bow on her head.

827
01:07:36,849 --> 01:07:37,850
That's it?

828
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:43,397
- Get right out of town.
- No, that's it.

829
01:07:52,156 --> 01:07:56,368
Thanks for being on Wayne's World.
It was informative and stimulating.

830
01:07:56,451 --> 01:07:58,662
Now a word from our sponsor.

831
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:00,831
We're at commercial.

832
01:08:00,914 --> 01:08:03,000
Oh, that was fun.

833
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:05,377
- I'll see you next week.
- I hope.

834
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,005
Wayne, come to the booth, please?

835
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:11,133
Oh, honey, you were incredible.

836
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:13,468
I think it went really well.

837
01:08:13,552 --> 01:08:17,598
Absolutely. There was a huge response
in that little room.

838
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:21,435
Those phrases were not on the cards
when I gave them to him.

839
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:25,564
Wayne. What the hell is going on?

840
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:28,650
- What are you doing?
- Same thing we always do.

841
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:31,153
You've publicly
humiliated the sponsor.

842
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:33,113
- Yeah.
- You're fired.

843
01:08:33,197 --> 01:08:37,117
Fired? For that?
Sh'yeah! Right!

844
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:40,120
I'm out of here,
and I'm taking my show with me.

845
01:08:40,204 --> 01:08:43,165
- We own the show.
- Aw, bite me.

846
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:47,503
OK.

847
01:08:47,586 --> 01:08:51,340
- Are we back?
- Stand by.

848
01:08:51,423 --> 01:08:53,800
- Coming back?
- And go.

849
01:08:53,884 --> 01:08:56,720
Five, four, three...

850
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,899
I'm having a good time...not.

851
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:14,321
Ever see Scanners
when that dude's head blew up?

852
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:25,374
- Hello?
- Hello.

853
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:26,708
It's Benjamin.

854
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:27,960
Oh, hi.

855
01:09:28,043 --> 01:09:30,420
Listen, did you see the show tonight?

856
01:09:30,504 --> 01:09:35,175
I was working, so I only saw the
first part, but I laughed my ass off.

857
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:39,596
We had some technical difficulties
and we're playing with the format.

858
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,306
Has Wayne talked to you?

859
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,311
About what?
Why? Are you cancelling my video?

860
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:48,772
No, I called
to make sure we're still on.

861
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:51,358
Well, we got a deal, right?

862
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:54,319
Absolutely. I'll see you in Chicago.

863
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:56,446
OK. Bye.

864
01:10:01,285 --> 01:10:03,579
You really pissed me off tonight.

865
01:10:03,662 --> 01:10:07,040
Garth, you've never been mad
at anything in your life.

866
01:10:07,124 --> 01:10:10,544
You shouldn't have walked out.
I handled it OK,

867
01:10:10,627 --> 01:10:15,299
but you shouldn't walk out on your
friend without telling him first.

868
01:10:15,382 --> 01:10:17,843
So I have to
run everything by you now?

869
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:20,637
Yeah, you have to
run everything by me now.

870
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:24,433
What am I, a chimp?
"With you, as always, is Garth?"

871
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:26,268
Jim to your Marlin Perkins?

872
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:29,104
You know, Benjamin had you so snowed.

873
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:31,398
You know, he's got it for Cassandra.

874
01:10:31,482 --> 01:10:34,067
- No way.
- Way.

875
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:36,945
Sh'yeah! Cassandra's
not interested. As if.

876
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:42,367
OK, pop quiz. Cassandra is
not interested in Benjamin because

877
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:44,286
A: chicks think he's handsome,

878
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:46,455
B: has cool car,

879
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:48,916
C: has lots of cash,

880
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:50,751
D: has no visible scars,

881
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:53,754
E: does not live with parents.

882
01:10:53,837 --> 01:10:58,967
OK, how about F: you're a gimp.
Know what you can do with your quiz?

883
01:10:59,051 --> 01:11:01,512
Know what you can do with your show?

884
01:11:01,595 --> 01:11:03,514
You can take a flying...

885
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,525
..until the handle breaks off

886
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:17,861
and you have to find a doctor
to pull it out again.

887
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:20,113
Kiss your mother with that mouth?

888
01:11:20,197 --> 01:11:23,325
You've gone mental.
I'm getting out of here, Damien.

889
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:25,202
- Fine, then. Go.
- I'm gone.

890
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:26,829
- Go, then.
- I am.

891
01:11:26,912 --> 01:11:28,121
- Go.
- I'm gone.

892
01:11:28,205 --> 01:11:29,623
- Go, then.
- I am.

893
01:11:44,012 --> 01:11:48,225
Where you been? I waited up for you
last night, and you never showed.

894
01:11:48,308 --> 01:11:51,145
- Where are you going?
- Chicago.

895
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:54,565
Benjamin set up the video shoot
for three days.

896
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:57,317
I guess Benjamin will be there, too.

897
01:11:57,401 --> 01:12:00,404
He's producing it.
And what does that mean?

898
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:03,615
He's been paying you
a lot of attention lately.

899
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:06,702
Well, maybe he thinks
I've got some talent.

900
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:11,331
- Maybe he's pokin' ya.
- What?

901
01:12:11,415 --> 01:12:13,834
You think that's the way I get a gig?

902
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:18,088
Well, first he screws me, then you.
It's Dutch door action.

903
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,092
Could you be any more insulting?

904
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:24,094
Yeah.

905
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:28,432
I think you'd better leave.

906
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:33,187
Fine. I'm outta here.

907
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:41,487
Oh, man.

908
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:45,949
What the hell's going on?

909
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:50,370
I lost my show, I lost my
best friend, I lost my girl.

910
01:12:50,454 --> 01:12:53,165
I'm being shit on,
that's all, shit on.

911
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:56,126
And do you know
what really pisses me off?

912
01:12:56,210 --> 01:13:00,380
Where are you going?
OK, OK, come on back. Come on back.

913
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:02,799
Things aren't as bad as they seem.

914
01:13:02,883 --> 01:13:05,594
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to dump on you.

915
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:08,472
I'll figure something out. OK?

916
01:13:14,102 --> 01:13:16,563
Mr Donuthead,
who's trying to kill you?

917
01:13:16,647 --> 01:13:18,565
I don't know but they better not.

918
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:24,655
If you stab a man in winter,
steam will rise up from the wounds.

919
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:30,577
That's not good!
I'm not happy! Oh, no!

920
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:34,206
Indians believed it was his soul
escaping from his body.

921
01:13:34,289 --> 01:13:35,958
Right, Glen.

922
01:13:43,674 --> 01:13:45,509
Hi.

923
01:13:51,014 --> 01:13:52,224
Hi.

924
01:13:52,307 --> 01:13:55,936
I'm sorry about what I did.

925
01:13:56,019 --> 01:13:57,646
Buds?

926
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:00,607
Buds.

927
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:07,364
Officer Koharski.

928
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:12,244
Damn shame how they screwed up
your show. Nice little programme.

929
01:14:12,327 --> 01:14:14,830
Not that I ever watched it.

930
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:16,623
Here you go.

931
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:20,252
- So, uh, how you doing?
- 'K, s'pose.

932
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:22,588
Just wish I had Cassandra back.

933
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:26,216
She's in Chicago
shooting a video with Benjamin.

934
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,594
So...

935
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:31,638
- what are you going to do?
- I don't know.

936
01:14:31,722 --> 01:14:33,557
I do have one plan.

937
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:39,396
What are you gonna do
with these guys?

938
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,440
Oh, nothing, really.

939
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:47,571
I always wanted to open a door
to a room of people being trained

940
01:14:47,654 --> 01:14:49,364
like in James Bond movies.

941
01:14:49,448 --> 01:14:51,700
- Wicked.
- Yeah.

942
01:14:57,331 --> 01:15:00,209
I think you should
just go get Cassandra.

943
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:02,586
I just don't think she wants me to.

944
01:15:02,669 --> 01:15:06,798
Let me tell you a little something
I've learned about women.

945
01:15:06,882 --> 01:15:09,551
They want you to come get them.

946
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,434
They love it.

947
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:22,189
I wish there was something
I could offer that Benjamin couldn't.

948
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:24,191
You'll think of something.

949
01:15:24,274 --> 01:15:26,944
Wait a minute!

950
01:15:27,027 --> 01:15:28,654
No.

951
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:30,072
Wait a minute!

952
01:15:31,615 --> 01:15:33,492
Wait a minute! I know!

953
01:15:33,575 --> 01:15:37,621
The guy in the limo, Mr Big,
the guy who owns Sharp Records.

954
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:41,083
If we could just get him to listen
to Cassandra play.

955
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:44,002
Halt. Halt.
Remember the security guard?

956
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:47,965
He said Mr Sharp was driving back
through Chicago on Friday.

957
01:15:48,048 --> 01:15:49,800
That's right. Wow.

958
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:53,512
Aren't we lucky we were there
to get that information?

959
01:15:53,595 --> 01:15:55,806
It seemed extraneous at the time.

960
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:59,518
OK, first I'll access the
secret military spy satellite

961
01:15:59,601 --> 01:16:02,855
in its geosynchronous orbit
over the Midwest.

962
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:06,900
Then I'll ID the limo by the vanity
plate "MR BIGGG".

963
01:16:06,984 --> 01:16:07,985
Yes.

964
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:11,697
Then I'll reposition the
transmitter dish in the truck

965
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:15,492
to 1 7.32 degrees east,
hit Westar 4 over the Atlantic,

966
01:16:15,576 --> 01:16:18,704
bounce the signal down into
the Azores, up to Comsat 6,

967
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:21,498
beam it back to Satcom 3
transponder 1 37,

968
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:24,918
and down to the dish
of Mr Big's limo.

969
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:27,129
It's almost too easy.

970
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:33,594
We can only pray he's watching TV
in his limo at that exact moment.

971
01:16:33,677 --> 01:16:36,305
- We'll need help.
- We'll help!

972
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:38,932
You get Cassandra! We'll do the rest!

973
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:41,727
To the mirthmobile!

974
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:53,322
OK, this is a take, everybody.

975
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:55,741
I think the snake fell asleep!

976
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:01,163
Playback!

977
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,880
Looking good!

978
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:50,379
- This snake weighs a ton.
- It looks great on you.

979
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:54,049
- I'm coming down now.
- I'm telling you, you're hot!

980
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:32,379
Yes, officer? Is something wrong?

981
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:34,673
Have you seen this boy?

982
01:18:46,351 --> 01:18:50,022
You know, you're exactly right.
Why leave the hotel?

983
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:53,817
We'll have dinner sent up,
you can have a hot bath.

984
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:55,819
Hold this.

985
01:18:57,529 --> 01:19:00,449
- We have to talk.
- I don't want to talk to you.

986
01:19:00,532 --> 01:19:03,035
I've set up an audition
for your band.

987
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:05,496
My show is back.
You've got to be on it.

988
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:08,624
- Wayne, go home.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

989
01:19:08,707 --> 01:19:10,542
Cassandra, I love you.

990
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:13,295
You may not believe it,
but I love you.

991
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:17,549
Am I supposed to just
turn my back and leave?

992
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:20,177
Am I supposed to be a man?

993
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:24,431
Am I supposed to say,
"That's OK, I don't mind.

994
01:19:25,808 --> 01:19:26,975
"I don't mind."

995
01:19:27,059 --> 01:19:29,937
Well, I mind! I mind big time!

996
01:19:31,647 --> 01:19:34,399
And you know what
the worst part of all is?

997
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:37,361
I never learned to read.

998
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:41,198
Is that true?

999
01:19:41,281 --> 01:19:44,284
Yes. Everything except
the reading part.

1000
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,621
Nice speech but we're busy.

1001
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:52,584
Oh, of course.
Her music video. Very clever.

1002
01:19:52,668 --> 01:19:54,586
But where is her band?

1003
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,129
Hi, Wayne.

1004
01:19:56,213 --> 01:19:59,591
Oh, hi, guys.
I didn't see you there.

1005
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:03,679
Well, I guess you've thought
of everything, huh?

1006
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:06,598
Nothing left for me to do
but just go home.

1007
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:09,184
Bye-bye, Wayne. It's bedtime.

1008
01:20:09,268 --> 01:20:14,857
But both you and I know
that there is no film in this camera.

1009
01:20:18,902 --> 01:20:20,195
Jimmy!

1010
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:27,786
Wayne...go home!

1011
01:20:37,504 --> 01:20:40,215
Sometimes people outgrow one another.

1012
01:20:40,299 --> 01:20:43,177
It's very sad
but you can't let it drag you down.

1013
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:46,346
Is that you...or the snake?

1014
01:20:50,309 --> 01:20:52,102
Campbell, wait up!

1015
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:56,648
Cassandra, I know I don't have
his looks, I don't have his money,

1016
01:20:56,732 --> 01:21:00,486
I don't have his connections,
his knowledge of fine wines,

1017
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:03,447
when I eat I get
this clicking in my jaw...

1018
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:06,366
Shut your yap and get in the car.

1019
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,743
Excellent.

1020
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:25,052
That's right, girl. Mr Big's limo
is right where we want it.

1021
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:34,853
Gentlemen, this is it. Let's go.

1022
01:21:34,937 --> 01:21:36,522
Down now!

1023
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:48,033
Wait up, guys. I fell on my keys.

1024
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:12,099
- Freeze!
- Oh, hi, Russell. How's it going?

1025
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:16,019
- Hold it! Hey! Hey!
- Watch where you're pointing that.

1026
01:22:17,146 --> 01:22:20,399
Give me the flashlight, Russell.
Give it to me.

1027
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:22,192
You can help us, Russell.

1028
01:22:22,276 --> 01:22:24,903
No! I'm supposed to stop you.

1029
01:22:24,987 --> 01:22:26,864
What are you gonna do?

1030
01:22:26,947 --> 01:22:30,033
You gonna be Benjamin's monkey boy
all your life?

1031
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:32,911
- Benjamin's my friend.
- No.

1032
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:36,915
Benjamin is no one's friend.

1033
01:22:36,999 --> 01:22:40,169
If Benjamin were
an ice cream flavour,

1034
01:22:40,252 --> 01:22:43,380
he'd be pralines and dick.

1035
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:46,925
It's OK!

1036
01:22:49,887 --> 01:22:52,598
He's gonna be...OK.

1037
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:56,518
Hi.

1038
01:22:56,602 --> 01:22:58,395
Hi. How's it going?

1039
01:23:07,779 --> 01:23:10,741
- I love you, man.
- I know.

1040
01:23:13,452 --> 01:23:15,370
No, you don't.

1041
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:17,706
I...love you, man.

1042
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:21,168
I know.

1043
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:23,378
Just say thank you.

1044
01:23:29,468 --> 01:23:31,845
Thank you. All right.

1045
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:35,766
I understand you're doing your job,
but I'm very late.

1046
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:39,436
Would you mind placing your hands
on the hood, son?

1047
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,815
There's just one other thing
I've got to check.

1048
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:02,417
OK, this is a special
Wayne's World, OK?

1049
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:07,297
It's for an audience of one.
So Mr Frankie Sharp of Sharp Records,

1050
01:24:07,381 --> 01:24:09,925
if you like what you see,

1051
01:24:10,008 --> 01:24:13,595
we're at 2234 Pine Way
in Aurora, Illinois.

1052
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:15,639
So, ladies and gentlemen,

1053
01:24:15,722 --> 01:24:18,976
I give you Cassandra
and Crucial Taunt!

1054
01:26:52,296 --> 01:26:56,425
Hi. I'm Frankie Sharp.
I saw your performance in my limo.

1055
01:26:56,508 --> 01:26:59,094
I've seen a lot of acts in my day,

1056
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:03,849
and although you're very beautiful,
I just think it's the wrong time.

1057
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:05,726
I'm sorry.

1058
01:27:07,811 --> 01:27:09,521
You screwed my career!

1059
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:13,358
I always knew you were small-time.

1060
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:16,778
Wayne, I'm pregnant.

1061
01:27:16,862 --> 01:27:19,281
That's why I've been so moody.

1062
01:27:22,743 --> 01:27:26,205
Whoa! Look! Fire!
Let's get out of here!

1063
01:27:42,304 --> 01:27:44,139
Why, God?

1064
01:27:45,349 --> 01:27:47,434
Why?

1065
01:27:54,066 --> 01:27:58,695
Last night was the most
incredible night of my life.

1066
01:27:58,779 --> 01:28:00,823
You were terrific.

1067
01:28:10,457 --> 01:28:12,709
You didn't really think
she'd end up with Wayne, did you?

1068
01:28:15,587 --> 01:28:16,922
As if.

1069
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:19,716
As if we'd end the movie
like that. Sh'yeah!

1070
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,136
- The Scooby-Doo ending!
- Good call.

1071
01:28:40,863 --> 01:28:45,200
Hi. Frankie Sharp.
I saw your performance in my limo.

1072
01:28:45,284 --> 01:28:46,827
Wow! We got through!

1073
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:50,122
Well, that wraps it up,
but there's one last thing.

1074
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:53,375
Let's just see who
you really are, mister.

1075
01:28:54,251 --> 01:28:57,171
Old man Withers
from the haunted amusement park!

1076
01:28:57,254 --> 01:29:01,175
I woulda got away with it, too,
if not for you snooping kids!

1077
01:29:01,258 --> 01:29:05,471
- Good one, Shaggy.
- Excellent Scooby-Doo ending.

1078
01:29:05,554 --> 01:29:09,558
- We should do the megahappy ending.
- That's doable.

1079
01:29:28,702 --> 01:29:33,415
Hi. I'm Frankie Sharp.
I saw your performance in my limo.

1080
01:29:33,499 --> 01:29:35,876
I must tell you, it was terrific.

1081
01:29:35,959 --> 01:29:41,465
In fact, I think it's so good,
I'm gonna give you a six-album deal.

1082
01:29:41,548 --> 01:29:43,050
See you in my office.

1083
01:29:44,259 --> 01:29:47,304
- I love you, Wayne.
- I love you, Cassandra.

1084
01:29:51,225 --> 01:29:54,520
- I love you, Garth.
- I love you, dreamwoman.

1085
01:29:56,313 --> 01:30:00,359
Ever since I did your show,
kids look at me in a whole new way.

1086
01:30:01,109 --> 01:30:03,779
- I love you, man.
- And I love you.

1087
01:30:03,862 --> 01:30:09,785
Because I've learned that platonic
love can exist between two grown men.

1088
01:30:09,868 --> 01:30:12,079
And I've learned something, too.

1089
01:30:12,162 --> 01:30:15,582
I've learned that
a flawless profile, a perfect body,

1090
01:30:15,666 --> 01:30:17,751
the right clothes and a great car

1091
01:30:17,835 --> 01:30:20,754
can get you far in America,
almost to the top,

1092
01:30:20,838 --> 01:30:23,048
but it can't get you everything.

1093
01:30:24,341 --> 01:30:27,511
Isn't it great
that we're all better people?

1094
01:30:28,554 --> 01:30:31,932
Fished in! Fished in!

1095
01:31:22,357 --> 01:31:24,860
Excellent movie. All right.

1096
01:31:24,943 --> 01:31:26,236
Good one.

1097
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,780
Well, that's all the time
for our movie.

1098
01:31:28,864 --> 01:31:32,910
We hope you found it entertaining,
whimsical yet relevant,

1099
01:31:32,993 --> 01:31:35,746
with an underlying
revisionist conceit

1100
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:39,958
that belied its emotional attachments
to the subject matter.

1101
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:43,253
I just hope you didn't think
it sucked.

1102
01:31:43,337 --> 01:31:46,507
OK. Thank you for coming.
Good night and party on.

1103
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:49,259
- Party on, Wayne.
- Party on, Garth.

1104
01:33:55,761 --> 01:34:00,098
You know, I don't think anyone's
gonna tell us when to leave.

1105
01:34:00,182 --> 01:34:02,351
Yeah. Good call, Garth.

1106
01:34:02,434 --> 01:34:04,895
I'll bet we're just gonna sit here,

1107
01:34:04,978 --> 01:34:08,398
and when they're finished,
they'll fade to black.

1108
01:34:11,235 --> 01:34:13,946
I can't believe they did that.

1109
01:34:14,029 --> 01:34:15,697
I told ya.
