1
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:59,369
No, please! No! Please!

2
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,038
Davey!

3
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:04,536
- Come running, lad!
- Please don't!

4
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:08,873
- Stop it!
- Brand you like a damn steer!

5
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:10,779
- Bitch!
- No, please!

6
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,053
Hold the bitch! Hold her!

7
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,623
Hold her or I'll cut her tits off!

8
00:02:17,793 --> 00:02:19,729
Go get Skinny! Quick!

9
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:22,732
Mike, don't!

10
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,129
Skinny!

11
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:31,236
Think it's funny?

12
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,471
Skinny, get the gun!

13
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:48,159
Get off of her, cowboy.

14
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:57,670
- They wouldn't let you settle it?
- You know Skinny.

15
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,501
He says he'll shoot them.

16
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:03,113
I says, "You can't."
He says, "Get Little Bill."

17
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:05,942
I says, "He's sleeping."
But he don't care.

18
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:08,677
He'll shoot them boys soon.

19
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,635
She dying?

20
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,699
She'll live.

21
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,867
She didn't steal nothing
or touch his poke.

22
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,637
When she seen his
teensy little pecker...

23
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,649
...she giggled.
She didn't know no better.

24
00:03:40,323 --> 00:03:42,052
Hang them, Little Bill.

25
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:05,912
Go to the office and get the bullwhip.

26
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,686
A whipping's all they
get after what they done?

27
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:15,188
- It ain't no little thing.
- But what they done...

28
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:16,763
Alice!

29
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:18,422
Shut up!

30
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:23,872
- Whipping won't settle this.
- No?

31
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:27,933
Here's a contract between me and
Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.

32
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:34,040
I brought her from Boston,
paid her expenses and all.

33
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:37,945
I got a contract that represents
an investment of capital.

34
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,550
Property.

35
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,585
Damaged property.

36
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:45,394
Like if I hamstrung one of their ponies.

37
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,061
You think nobody'll fuck her now?

38
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,302
Hell, no!

39
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,471
Leastways, won't pay to do it!

40
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:59,140
Nobody's going to pay good money
for a cut-up whore!

41
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:04,578
You boys are off the Bar T.

42
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:06,915
Got your own ponies?

43
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:09,254
Yeah, I got four.

44
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:13,593
Six.

45
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:18,097
Guess you want no trial, no fuss?

46
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,103
No, sir.

47
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:21,996
All right.

48
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:24,264
You did the cutting.

49
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:28,272
This fall, you bring in
five ponies to Skinny.

50
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:30,176
Five?

51
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,781
And you...

52
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,282
...bring two.

53
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:35,615
- You give them over, hear?
- Yes, sir.

54
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:37,818
The whip.

55
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:42,619
Maybe we don't need it now.

56
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,795
I'll tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies...

57
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:53,203
...I'll come looking for you.
- You ain't whipping them?

58
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:57,472
I fined them instead, Alice.

59
00:05:57,714 --> 00:06:00,378
Skinny gets some ponies and that's it?!

60
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,544
That ain't fair.

61
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:05,245
That ain't fair!

62
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,998
Haven't you seen enough blood tonight?

63
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,329
Hell, Alice...

64
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:25,005
...it ain't like they was
tramps or loafers or...

65
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:27,009
...bad men. They were just...

66
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,345
...hardworking boys that were foolish.

67
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:34,520
- If they was wicked in a regular way...
- Like whores?

68
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,255
Tend to Delilah.

69
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:42,027
Go ahead.

70
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,284
I got $85.

71
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,791
I don't know.

72
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,797
If Delilah doesn't care,
what are we so riled up about?

73
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:15,397
We let them smelly fools
ride us like horses...

74
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:18,904
...doesn't mean we must let
them brand us like horses.

75
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:21,976
Maybe we ain't nothing
but whores, but...

76
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:24,578
...by God, we ain't horses!

77
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:27,911
I got $112.

78
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:31,085
That's everything.

79
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:32,813
And you, Faith?

80
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,184
200.

81
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:41,599
240... dollars.

82
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:45,170
Jesus, what you been doing?

83
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,998
Giving Skinny something special?

84
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,442
She laughs.

85
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,017
With what Kate got, and Silky,
me and Little Sue...

86
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,850
It ain't enough.

87
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,855
Not yet, maybe.

88
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,344
You don't look like no son-of-a-
bitching cold-blooded assassin.

89
00:08:57,522 --> 00:08:58,750
Say what?

90
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:02,520
You call yourself Mr. William Munny.

91
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:07,187
You have me confused with
someone else, mister.

92
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,761
Shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?

93
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:13,028
Hey, Pa!

94
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:14,764
What, son?

95
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:16,933
Two more hogs got the fever.

96
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:19,034
You shot Charlie Pepper.

97
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:22,610
You killed William Harvey and
robbed that train in Missouri.

98
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:24,115
Hold on.

99
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,121
Son, get those hogs separated there.

100
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:30,221
Penny, help your brother.

101
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,723
That one's sick too.

102
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:38,727
We'll talk inside.

103
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:49,303
So you're Pete Sothow's nephew?

104
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:54,987
I thought you'd come to kill me for
something I'd done in the old days.

105
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,422
I could have.

106
00:09:58,926 --> 00:09:59,790
Easy.

107
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:03,823
I guess maybe so.

108
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:10,265
You don't look like no meaner-than-hell,
cold-blooded damn killer.

109
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,331
Maybe I ain't.

110
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:17,947
Uncle Pete says you was the meanest
goddamn son-of-a-bitch alive.

111
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:20,605
And if I wanted a
partner for a killing...

112
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:22,950
...you were the worst one.

113
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,355
Meaning the best.

114
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:31,288
Because you're as cold as snow...

115
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,364
...and don't have no
weak nerve nor fear.

116
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,699
Pete said that?

117
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,638
He did.

118
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:46,204
I'm a killer myself, but I
haven't killed as many as you...

119
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,143
...because of my youth.

120
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,807
Schofield Kid, they call me.

121
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:54,878
Why?

122
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:57,549
You from Schofield?

123
00:10:58,161 --> 00:10:59,889
No, it's on account of my...

124
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:03,557
...Schofield-Smith & Wesson pistol.

125
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:09,905
How about it?

126
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:12,501
How about what?

127
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:15,176
How about being my partner?

128
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,413
I'm heading north in
through Niobrara to Wyoming.

129
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:21,245
Kill two no-good cowboys.

130
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,220
For what?

131
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,422
For cutting up a lady.

132
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:28,425
Her face.

133
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:31,528
Cut her eyes out, her ears off.

134
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:34,524
They even cut her teets.

135
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:39,273
Jesus.

136
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:42,270
$1,000 reward, Will.

137
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:45,112
500 each.

138
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,714
I can't move those damn pigs!

139
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:54,388
Watch your cussing.

140
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,619
Do your best. Go to the
pump and get cleaned up.

141
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:59,388
Come on.

142
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:08,234
I ain't like that anymore, Kid.

143
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,143
It was whiskey done it as
much as anything else.

144
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:15,745
I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.

145
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,741
My wife...

146
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:19,809
...cured me...

147
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:22,648
...of drink and...

148
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,153
...wickedness.

149
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,259
You don't look so prosperous.

150
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,333
You could buy her a new
dress with your half.

151
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:36,266
You could buy your wife a fancy...

152
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,340
She's passed on.

153
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:44,778
Been gone near three years now.

154
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,861
Don't tell anyone about the reward.
I don't need no one else trying to collect.

155
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,995
Don't see no one.

156
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,458
Change your mind, you could catch me.

157
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:06,197
I'll ride due west for the
trail headed north into Wyoming.

158
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:14,316
Let's separate those hogs.

159
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,113
Two others.

160
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,853
I think they got the fever.

161
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:48,755
Took you boys a while.

162
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,253
A few more days and I was
going to call on the sheriff.

163
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:55,098
How about that?

164
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:58,326
The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.

165
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:01,437
I bet. Get them horses to the livery.

166
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:04,270
Take that one over around the back.

167
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:14,181
Now here's a beauty.

168
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,622
You got my two. This one ain't yours.

169
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,624
We'll see about that.

170
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:23,697
Bastards! Get out of town!

171
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:25,858
Get out of here!

172
00:15:26,035 --> 00:15:28,129
You are very sick sons-of-bitches!

173
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:34,209
Don't come back, butcher!

174
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,969
This here pony...

175
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:39,549
...I brung for the lady my partner cut.

176
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:52,989
She's the best.

177
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:00,065
Better than what I gave him.

178
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,578
She can sell her...

179
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,846
...or do what she wants.

180
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:13,920
A pony?

181
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:17,858
She ain't got no face left
and you give her a mangy pony?

182
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:19,587
She ain't mangy!

183
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:21,927
Get out of here!

184
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:25,927
We don't need your goddamn charity!

185
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:29,034
Get out of our town and don't come back!

186
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:33,045
Get out of our town!

187
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:48,359
Did Pa use to kill folks?

188
00:18:56,878 --> 00:19:00,212
I could tell your ma liked
those flowers I gave her.

189
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:04,647
She ain't a saddle horse no more, Pa.
Ain't used to the feel.

190
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:07,551
Take care of your sister, son.

191
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:12,389
Kill a few chickens if you must and
keep those hogs with fever separate.

192
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:16,998
If you have any problem, go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.

193
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:45,364
Ain't been in the saddle
myself in a while.

194
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,201
She's getting even with me
for the sins of my youth.

195
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:57,612
In my youth before I met
your dear departed ma...

196
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:01,214
...I was weak and given
to mistreating animals.

197
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:10,125
This horse and those hogs over there...

198
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,293
...are getting even for
the cruelty I inflicted.

199
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:20,905
I used to be able to cuss
and whip a horse like this...

200
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:23,977
...but your ma showed me
the error of my ways.

201
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:27,306
I'll be back in 2 weeks.

202
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:32,148
The spirit of your dear
departed ma watches over you.

203
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:53,275
- Where'd you get the money?
- We ain't got any!

204
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:56,505
- You told them cowboys you had!
- We was lying!

205
00:20:57,617 --> 00:20:58,778
Lying?

206
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,010
What if somebody comes to collect?

207
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:06,794
You going to hump them
a thousand times?

208
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:13,695
The people come for that thousand
won't tolerate you not having it!

209
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:19,466
They won't just cut up your face!

210
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,875
You stupid bitches.

211
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,811
Stupid bitches.

212
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:42,227
Shit!

213
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,493
Damn it! Jesus!

214
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:48,206
Get your finger?

215
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:52,179
Hello, Skinny.

216
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:54,512
You snuck up on me.

217
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:56,851
Like her?

218
00:21:57,754 --> 00:22:00,188
I heard you done the roof yourself.

219
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:01,751
Roof?

220
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:05,260
Jesus, I did practically
the whole damn thing myself.

221
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,363
The Roberts boy carried wood
for me, but that's all.

222
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,193
What's that wood?

223
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:16,701
I'm building a porch here so I can
sit of an evening and smoke my pipe...

224
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:20,443
...and drink coffee
and watch the sunset.

225
00:22:23,115 --> 00:22:25,380
Came out here just to
take a look at her?

226
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,382
Them whores...

227
00:22:28,288 --> 00:22:32,725
...been humping all them cowboys been
through town the last two weeks.

228
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:35,087
Shit.

229
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:40,558
We got railroad barons
and cattle barons.

230
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:43,068
You'll be the first billiard baron.

231
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:47,303
They been humping and telling
every bowlegged one of them...

232
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,804
...they'll pay $1,000 to whoever...

233
00:22:50,982 --> 00:22:54,077
...kills the two boys
that cut up Delilah.

234
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,587
Those cowboys are riding that
beef down to Kansas and Cheyenne?

235
00:23:08,602 --> 00:23:10,001
All week long?

236
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,603
I didn't hear till last night myself.

237
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:16,670
The word's got all the
way to Texas by now.

238
00:23:18,114 --> 00:23:20,274
Nobody will come clear from Texas.

239
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:24,615
They got all that money?

240
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:29,681
Women can lie. Ask where the
money is, they say they got none.

241
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:33,188
But the five of them could have it.

242
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:35,024
Maybe.

243
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:39,300
That much?

244
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:42,963
You could run off them two cowboys.

245
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:45,967
I could run off them whores.

246
00:23:48,882 --> 00:23:51,874
They'll just up and
run anyhow, them two.

247
00:23:55,723 --> 00:23:58,157
They'll stay out at the Bar T.

248
00:23:58,825 --> 00:24:00,555
Close to their friends.

249
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:05,228
Shit, could be nobody won't come at all.

250
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:10,002
Got to go. I like your house.

251
00:24:47,883 --> 00:24:49,214
It's Will.

252
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:58,217
Come in out of the sun.

253
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:01,220
See to Will's horse.

254
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,636
What you doing here?

255
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,404
Just thought I'd drop in on you.

256
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,741
We ain't bad men no more.

257
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,746
We're farmers.

258
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:22,419
Should be easy killing them, if
they don't go on down to Texas.

259
00:25:24,324 --> 00:25:28,658
How long since you fired a gun
at a man, Will? Ten years?

260
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:31,994
Eleven.

261
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:35,166
Easy, huh?

262
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:39,268
It wasn't all that easy even back then.

263
00:25:39,508 --> 00:25:41,773
And we were young and full of beans.

264
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,670
If you was mad at them...

265
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:48,013
...over some wrong, I
could see shooting them.

266
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:51,346
We done stuff for money before.

267
00:25:55,127 --> 00:25:56,685
We thought we did.

268
00:25:57,296 --> 00:25:58,957
What'd these fellows do?

269
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:03,963
Cheat at cards? Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?

270
00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:05,971
They cut up a woman.

271
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:13,813
Cut her face, cut her eyes out,
cut her fingers off, cut her tits.

272
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:18,216
Everything but her cunny, I suppose.

273
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:21,717
I'll be dogged.

274
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:28,064
Guess they got it coming.

275
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:31,158
Of course, Will...

276
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:35,337
...if Claudia was alive,
you wouldn't do this.

277
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:48,518
Could you look in on my
youngsters next week?

278
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:51,189
Got some hogs to separate.

279
00:26:53,861 --> 00:26:55,589
How long will you be gone?

280
00:26:58,267 --> 00:26:59,859
Two weeks, I guess.

281
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:13,374
What's this Kid like?

282
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:17,886
Three ways?

283
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,724
I see you still have that Spencer rifle.

284
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:27,891
And I can still knock the
eye out of a bird flying.

285
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:38,810
Jesus.

286
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:38,205
He must be moving right along.

287
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,379
We'll come across him
tomorrow, I reckon.

288
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:56,992
Got used to my bed.
This ain't going to be like home.

289
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,672
That ain't the only thing I'll miss.

290
00:29:07,148 --> 00:29:08,547
Hell, I'm sorry.

291
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:11,746
Don't fret it. It ain't nothing.

292
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:16,685
She don't like it much...

293
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,588
...you riding off with me.

294
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:21,591
Gave me the evil eye.

295
00:29:25,537 --> 00:29:27,868
You know, Sally's Indian and...

296
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:30,701
...lndians ain't over-friendly.

297
00:29:33,044 --> 00:29:34,534
I don't blame her.

298
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,871
I won't hold it against her.

299
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:40,042
She knew me back then.

300
00:29:40,554 --> 00:29:42,044
She knew what a...

301
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:45,047
...no-good son-of-a-bitch I was.

302
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:49,456
She ain't allowing that I changed.

303
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:53,064
She don't realize I
ain't like that no more.

304
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:55,635
- You know women.
- I ain't the same, Ned.

305
00:29:57,072 --> 00:30:01,907
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

306
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:04,907
Going on this killing...

307
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:07,982
...don't mean I'll go
back to the way I was.

308
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:11,416
Just need the money.

309
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:14,257
Get a new start for them youngsters.

310
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:22,332
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth...

311
00:30:22,503 --> 00:30:25,164
...and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

312
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:30,603
I think about him now and again.

313
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,513
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

314
00:30:37,353 --> 00:30:40,185
At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

315
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:48,123
You was one crazy son-of-a-bitch.

316
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:52,963
No one liked me.

317
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:56,971
The boys all thought I'd shoot
them out of pure meanness.

318
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:01,536
You ain't like that no more.

319
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:04,644
Eagle, he hated my guts.

320
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:08,881
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

321
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,221
Quincy neither, I reckon.

322
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,655
Quincy used to just watch all the time.

323
00:31:17,998 --> 00:31:19,556
Scared.

324
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:22,227
Like I said...

325
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:25,664
...you ain't like that no more.

326
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:28,009
That's right.

327
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,503
I'm just a fellow now.

328
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,583
I ain't no different than anyone else.

329
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:36,583
No more.

330
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:53,699
What son-of-a-bitch shot him?

331
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,602
Was it one of them John Bulls?

332
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:58,275
No, sir.

333
00:31:58,446 --> 00:32:02,882
The would-be assassin is a gentleman
of French ancestry. Or so it seems.

334
00:32:03,217 --> 00:32:05,618
I don't wish to give offense, but...

335
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:10,052
...the French are known to
be a race of assassins...

336
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:12,283
...who can't shoot worth a damn.

337
00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:15,954
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

338
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:19,132
Says here a fellow by
the name of Guiteau.

339
00:32:21,305 --> 00:32:24,469
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

340
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,640
Again, I don't wish to give offense...

341
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,977
...when I suggest that
this country select...

342
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:35,587
...a king or even a queen,
rather than a President.

343
00:32:37,424 --> 00:32:40,416
One isn't that quick to
shoot a king or a queen.

344
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,323
The majesty of royalty, you see.

345
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:49,326
Maybe you don't wish to
give offense, sir...

346
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:51,766
...but you are giving it pretty thick.

347
00:32:52,107 --> 00:32:54,940
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

348
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:57,941
- When I heard about queens...
- Shut up, Joe.

349
00:32:58,113 --> 00:33:00,776
What's wrong with you? This dude...

350
00:33:01,017 --> 00:33:03,953
Might be this dude here is English Bob.

351
00:33:05,122 --> 00:33:08,023
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

352
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:10,853
Might be waiting for some cowboy...

353
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:14,020
...to touch his pistol
so he can shoot him.

354
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:27,644
Is that a fact, mister?

355
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,380
You English Bob?

356
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:34,047
Pheasants.

357
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:38,484
Let's shoot some pheasants.

358
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:39,992
Ten shots.

359
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:42,993
And let's say $1 a pheasant.

360
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:46,831
I'll shoot for the Queen, and you for...

361
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,832
...whomever.

362
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:07,250
That's 8 for me and 1 for you.

363
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:10,089
That comes to 7 American dollars.

364
00:34:10,697 --> 00:34:12,757
Pretty damn good shooting...

365
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,098
...for a John Bull.

366
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:18,370
No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief...

367
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:23,270
...over the injury to your President.

368
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:39,557
It's the climate that does it.
That, and the infernal distances.

369
00:34:39,798 --> 00:34:40,891
Does what?

370
00:34:41,232 --> 00:34:44,395
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

371
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,970
It's a savage country, really.

372
00:34:49,141 --> 00:34:52,236
That's the second one
they shot in 20 years.

373
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:56,242
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

374
00:35:53,316 --> 00:35:54,646
Thank you.

375
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,811
Pardon me, gentlemen.

376
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,652
The law obliges you to
surrender all sidearms...

377
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,490
...to the proper authorities
during your visit.

378
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,830
Proper authority?

379
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,495
I can assure you...

380
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:17,337
...that neither my companion or
I carry firearms on our person.

381
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:21,681
We rely upon the goodwill of
our fellow man and the...

382
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:24,350
...forbearance of reptiles.

383
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,900
Unarmed, my ass.

384
00:36:40,504 --> 00:36:42,334
Christ, it's hot.

385
00:36:42,606 --> 00:36:46,839
If I'm going to get shot, I'd
rather it was hot than cold.

386
00:36:47,345 --> 00:36:50,405
Everything hurts me more when it's cold.

387
00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:52,879
- If you hit your thumb...
- Shut up, Fatty!

388
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,344
- I only said...
- Clyde's back.

389
00:36:56,856 --> 00:36:58,619
- With Little Bill?
- No.

390
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:00,519
Shit.

391
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:08,699
- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.

392
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:11,795
Where's Little Bill, for chrissake?

393
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:13,865
Building his damn porch.

394
00:37:14,543 --> 00:37:16,010
Building his porch?

395
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:19,947
If you got shot, would you want
it to be a hot or cold day?

396
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:21,945
I ain't going to get shot.

397
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,048
He's coming?

398
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:27,814
Of course he's coming.

399
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,049
I just loaded that.

400
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:33,322
I don't trust nobody to load
my guns for a shooting.

401
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:35,822
What he say?

402
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,328
Little Bill said he
was building his porch.

403
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:41,733
You seen that thing?

404
00:37:41,908 --> 00:37:43,570
It was all loaded.

405
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,573
You got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

406
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:50,206
I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

407
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:56,081
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

408
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,585
Or the whole house, for that matter!

409
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:01,091
He is the worst damn carpenter.

410
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,426
He didn't say nothing?

411
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,190
Asked what they looked like.

412
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:10,604
Maybe he's tough but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

413
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:12,873
Maybe he ain't so tough.

414
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:15,774
Seem like he was scared?

415
00:38:17,616 --> 00:38:19,708
Little Bill? Him scared?

416
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:24,218
We never seen him up
against any like these ones.

417
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:25,446
Killers.

418
00:38:26,793 --> 00:38:29,956
Little Bill come out of
Kansas and Texas, boys.

419
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:32,724
He worked them tough towns.

420
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,398
Just wondered.

421
00:38:36,337 --> 00:38:38,271
Anybody could be scared.

422
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:45,303
He wasn't scared, boys.

423
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:48,313
He just ain't no carpenter.

424
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:59,327
There's a dignity in royalty which
precludes the likelihood of assassination.

425
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:02,489
If you pointed a pistol at a queen...

426
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:05,262
...your hands would shake as if palsied.

427
00:39:05,437 --> 00:39:07,768
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

428
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:11,166
Always a wise policy.

429
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:14,572
But if you did, I can assure you...

430
00:39:14,848 --> 00:39:19,343
...the sight of royalty would cause you
to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed.

431
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,182
You would stand, how should I put it...

432
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:23,583
...in awe.

433
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:28,286
Now, a President...

434
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:31,455
Well, why not shoot the President?

435
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,031
Keep the change.

436
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:43,044
This Strawberry Alice
person, tell me again.

437
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:47,048
Down the street to Greely's Beer
Garden and Billiards Parlor.

438
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,809
Say you want a game of billiards.

439
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:50,977
Billiards?

440
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,388
Even though I don't wish to play?

441
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,996
No matter. They burned the
table in '78 for firewood.

442
00:39:57,998 --> 00:39:59,056
Right.

443
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,392
Quite right.

444
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:03,631
Mr. Beauchamp, I think a cup of tea...

445
00:40:18,754 --> 00:40:20,016
Hello, Bob.

446
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,151
Boys, this here is English Bob.

447
00:40:26,597 --> 00:40:28,588
Shit and fried eggs.

448
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:32,661
Been a long time.

449
00:40:33,939 --> 00:40:35,429
Run out of Chinamen?

450
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:40,035
I thought that you were dead.

451
00:40:41,115 --> 00:40:43,605
You've shaved your chin whiskers off.

452
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:47,543
I was tasting the soup
two hours after I ate it.

453
00:40:48,555 --> 00:40:50,547
Actually, what I heard was you...

454
00:40:50,691 --> 00:40:53,559
...fell off your horse.
Drunk, of course.

455
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:56,458
And that you broke your bloody neck.

456
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,959
I heard that one myself, Bob.

457
00:41:00,202 --> 00:41:02,193
Hell, I even thought I was dead.

458
00:41:02,404 --> 00:41:05,067
Till I found out I was just in Nebraska.

459
00:41:06,644 --> 00:41:07,769
Who's he?

460
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:09,810
W.W. Beauchamp.

461
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:13,645
This is Little Bill Daggett.

462
00:41:14,486 --> 00:41:16,578
And friends, of course.

463
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:20,149
From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?

464
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:22,425
In person.

465
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,330
You work for the railroads too?

466
00:41:28,335 --> 00:41:29,495
I write.

467
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:31,595
Letters?

468
00:41:32,005 --> 00:41:33,837
Books, Bill. Books.

469
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:36,003
Actually...

470
00:41:36,511 --> 00:41:38,503
...he's my biographer.

471
00:41:44,687 --> 00:41:47,178
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

472
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:56,524
It's only a book.

473
00:41:57,035 --> 00:41:58,127
A book?

474
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:06,068
That means you boys can read.

475
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:09,379
That means you saw the signs...

476
00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:12,712
...saying surrender your firearms.

477
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:16,980
But like you told young Andy...

478
00:42:18,793 --> 00:42:20,489
...you're not armed, are you?

479
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:23,725
Not really, Bill.

480
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:28,731
Got a Peacemaker, but that
wouldn't worry you, would it?

481
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,566
If you don't see it.
Or better, if you don't hear it.

482
00:42:33,743 --> 00:42:35,507
I'm afraid so, Bob.

483
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:38,181
I don't like firearms around.

484
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:02,107
Be very careful with it, sonny.

485
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,351
See what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing.

486
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,951
Make sure you don't get wet.

487
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,234
No shit.

488
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,363
All he's got is writing
stuff and this book.

489
00:43:32,478 --> 00:43:34,070
"The Duck of Death?"

490
00:43:34,314 --> 00:43:35,372
Duke.

491
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:38,883
"The Duke."

492
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:43,989
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

493
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:46,159
I'll have that.32, Bob.

494
00:43:59,608 --> 00:44:01,008
Now, Little Bill.

495
00:44:02,013 --> 00:44:05,004
You will leave me at
the mercy of my enemies.

496
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,284
Enemies?

497
00:44:14,692 --> 00:44:17,288
You been talking about the Queen again?

498
00:44:18,431 --> 00:44:20,126
On Independence Day?

499
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,713
I guess you think I'm kicking you.

500
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:37,876
But it ain't so!

501
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,155
What I'm doing is talking!

502
00:44:40,356 --> 00:44:41,345
Hear?!

503
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:44,325
Talking to all them villains in Kansas!

504
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,055
To all those villains in Missouri!

505
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,070
And those villains...

506
00:44:57,409 --> 00:44:59,344
...down in Cheyenne!

507
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:07,679
I'm saying there ain't no whore's gold!

508
00:45:13,261 --> 00:45:16,355
Even if there was, they
don't want to come for it...

509
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:18,728
...anyhow!

510
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,458
What are you looking at?!

511
00:45:49,635 --> 00:45:50,933
Go on!

512
00:45:58,312 --> 00:46:00,305
Mind your own business!

513
00:46:29,082 --> 00:46:30,572
Ever go into town?

514
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:33,182
On occasion.

515
00:46:33,453 --> 00:46:35,854
To sell a hog, pick up supplies.

516
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,355
I mean, get yourself a woman.

517
00:46:42,864 --> 00:46:45,094
No, I never go into town for that.

518
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,090
A man like me?

519
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:51,704
Only woman I could get is
one I'd have to pay for.

520
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:54,972
That ain't right, buying flesh.

521
00:46:56,312 --> 00:46:59,477
Claudia, rest her soul,
wouldn't want me doing that.

522
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:01,479
Me being a father, and all.

523
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:08,214
You just use your hand?

524
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,563
I don't miss it all that much.

525
00:47:37,427 --> 00:47:39,759
Goddamn, somebody's shooting at us!

526
00:47:41,265 --> 00:47:42,596
You hit?

527
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:47,530
I bumped my head falling off my horse.

528
00:47:52,777 --> 00:47:54,677
Ain't shooting at us no more.

529
00:47:57,116 --> 00:47:58,777
Shooting way over yonder.

530
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:03,282
What the hell's he shooting at?

531
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,621
Beats the hell out of me.

532
00:48:08,695 --> 00:48:10,961
Reckon we in somebody's field?

533
00:48:11,133 --> 00:48:13,123
I didn't see nothing planted.

534
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:15,593
Shooting at us again.

535
00:48:20,076 --> 00:48:22,566
He's shooting at the whole horizon.

536
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:25,477
Wait! You'll mark us!

537
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,981
Hey, Kid!

538
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,983
That's the Kid shooting at us?

539
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:32,985
Kid, it's me! Will Munny!

540
00:48:33,158 --> 00:48:35,592
What the hell's he shooting at us for?

541
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:36,988
That you?

542
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:41,165
Yeah, it's me!

543
00:48:41,601 --> 00:48:44,832
Don't go shooting at us
no more! You hear me?

544
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,838
Who the hell you got with you, Will?

545
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,242
It's Ned Logan, my old partner!

546
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,003
Don't go shooting at us, you hear?

547
00:48:54,749 --> 00:48:57,685
We'll get our horses
and come on over there.

548
00:48:57,953 --> 00:49:00,114
You ain't going to shoot, are you?

549
00:49:02,358 --> 00:49:03,689
I ain't!

550
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,638
Chased that horse a damn mile.

551
00:49:18,776 --> 00:49:22,372
- What was you shooting at us for?
- I thought you was following me.

552
00:49:22,648 --> 00:49:25,276
We was. You said if I changed my mind...

553
00:49:25,484 --> 00:49:28,147
Wasn't nothing said about no partner.

554
00:49:28,788 --> 00:49:30,654
This here's Ned Logan.

555
00:49:30,991 --> 00:49:34,153
He's the Schofield Kid,
nephew to Pete Sothow.

556
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:38,392
I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is you come to kill me.

557
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:42,062
We never talked about no other fellow.

558
00:49:42,904 --> 00:49:47,001
There's two cowboys. Better there's
three of us, if they got friends.

559
00:49:47,176 --> 00:49:51,078
I can take care of them two myself.
It don't take three.

560
00:49:51,814 --> 00:49:56,082
Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.

561
00:49:56,688 --> 00:49:58,587
Better than you, anyhow.

562
00:49:59,089 --> 00:50:02,025
- You wasn't even coming close.
- Hands off!

563
00:50:12,606 --> 00:50:16,440
Thought I'd check it for you.
Maybe something's bent.

564
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,043
It ain't... bent.

565
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:21,103
You were shooting all over creation!

566
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:22,840
You'll share your half with him?

567
00:50:23,452 --> 00:50:25,283
I figure three ways.

568
00:50:26,455 --> 00:50:27,717
Wrong.

569
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:31,790
Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.

570
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,128
You going back with him?

571
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:38,795
He's my partner.

572
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:41,134
He don't go, I don't.

573
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:48,075
What's it come to, three ways?

574
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:43,303
Shit!

575
00:51:44,879 --> 00:51:47,040
What are you pissing on about?

576
00:51:49,049 --> 00:51:51,314
What are you looking at?

577
00:51:51,553 --> 00:51:52,815
Looking at?

578
00:51:53,054 --> 00:51:54,317
Clouds.

579
00:51:54,657 --> 00:51:58,558
He's looking at them clouds on
account of we got a storm coming.

580
00:52:01,664 --> 00:52:03,154
I seen them.

581
00:52:13,678 --> 00:52:16,169
You was smart to change your mind.

582
00:52:19,352 --> 00:52:21,683
I'm a real good shot with this rifle.

583
00:52:24,257 --> 00:52:25,849
See that hawk?

584
00:52:29,196 --> 00:52:30,924
I could hit it with one shot.

585
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:38,863
Hell, I could hit it too.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.

586
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,374
There ain't no hawk, Kid.

587
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,370
You can't see for shit, can you?

588
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,383
See your canteen?

589
00:52:57,796 --> 00:52:59,388
How far can you see?

590
00:52:59,531 --> 00:53:00,520
Far enough.

591
00:53:00,732 --> 00:53:03,896
- We ain't going to shoot canteens!
- How far? 100 yards?

592
00:53:04,036 --> 00:53:05,128
More.

593
00:53:05,806 --> 00:53:08,639
- See that scrub oak tree yonder?
- Fuck you.

594
00:53:08,909 --> 00:53:11,810
- He's blind, Will!
- I ain't blind, you asshole!

595
00:53:12,245 --> 00:53:13,735
Hold it!

596
00:53:14,548 --> 00:53:17,143
How far can you see, Kid? 50 yards?

597
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:20,488
You bet your ass I can
see 50 yards, Will.

598
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:24,259
I can see well enough to
shoot this son-of-a-bitch.

599
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:25,824
Hold on.

600
00:53:26,261 --> 00:53:27,751
Hear that, Ned?

601
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:30,489
Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.

602
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,167
Jesus.

603
00:53:36,173 --> 00:53:39,439
Fifty yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.

604
00:53:48,856 --> 00:53:51,517
They look like real hard cases, Bob.

605
00:53:53,092 --> 00:53:54,856
Did you kill all 7 of them?

606
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:57,020
Or just wing some of them?

607
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:05,600
That you here embalmed on the cover?

608
00:54:08,377 --> 00:54:10,038
"The Duck of Death?"

609
00:54:10,813 --> 00:54:12,110
The Duke.

610
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:14,546
"The Duke of Death."

611
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:22,325
You always were good with a
pistol, but 7 of them? Boy!

612
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:25,485
Protecting that woman.
How the hell do you do that?

613
00:54:29,835 --> 00:54:33,897
It's desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain...

614
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,837
...liberty when depicting
the cover scene.

615
00:54:37,011 --> 00:54:39,137
For reasons involving the marketplace.

616
00:54:39,345 --> 00:54:43,908
From what I read, the writing's not
that much different than the picture.

617
00:54:46,153 --> 00:54:48,645
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...

618
00:54:49,024 --> 00:54:52,654
...that the events described are
taken from eyewitness accounts.

619
00:54:52,929 --> 00:54:54,862
- Eyewitnesses?
- Yes, sir.

620
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,522
Like the Duck himself, I guess.

621
00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:01,033
The Duke.

622
00:55:01,372 --> 00:55:02,770
Duck, I says.

623
00:55:11,282 --> 00:55:15,380
"'You have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman, Corcoran'...

624
00:55:15,555 --> 00:55:16,886
...said the Duck.

625
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,282
'You must apologize.'

626
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,120
But Two-Gun Corcoran
would none of it.

627
00:55:23,296 --> 00:55:26,788
Cursing, he reached for his
pistols and would have killed him...

628
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:31,633
...but the Duck was faster and hot
lead blazed from his smoking six-guns."

629
00:55:33,075 --> 00:55:35,976
I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

630
00:55:36,145 --> 00:55:40,583
There is a certain poetry to the
language which I couldn't resist.

631
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,986
I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita...

632
00:55:47,224 --> 00:55:50,318
...the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

633
00:55:50,928 --> 00:55:52,725
I didn't see you there...

634
00:55:53,498 --> 00:55:55,090
...nor no woman...

635
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:57,428
...nor two-gun shooters.

636
00:55:57,669 --> 00:55:59,160
Nor none of this.

637
00:55:59,438 --> 00:56:01,497
- You were there?
- Yeah, I was there.

638
00:56:04,745 --> 00:56:06,178
First off...

639
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:10,444
...Corky never carried two
guns, though he should have.

640
00:56:10,851 --> 00:56:12,843
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

641
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:15,012
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun.

642
00:56:15,356 --> 00:56:17,518
But not because he had two pistols.

643
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,194
He had a dick that was so big...

644
00:56:20,462 --> 00:56:23,363
...it was longer than the
barrel on his Walker Colt.

645
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,193
The only insulting he did
was stick that thing...

646
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:30,701
...into a French lady
English Bob was sweet on.

647
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:34,269
The night Corky walked
into the Blue Bottle...

648
00:56:35,046 --> 00:56:38,278
...before he knows what's what,
Bob takes a shot at him!

649
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:40,279
And misses, he's so damn drunk.

650
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:44,650
That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky, and he did the wrong thing.

651
00:56:45,391 --> 00:56:47,882
In his hurry, he shot his damn toe off.

652
00:56:48,795 --> 00:56:50,730
Meantime, Bob here...

653
00:56:51,398 --> 00:56:54,162
...aims real good and
squeezes off another...

654
00:56:54,301 --> 00:56:56,735
...but he misses, he's still so drunk!

655
00:56:56,904 --> 00:56:59,738
He hits this thousand-dollar
mirror over the bar.

656
00:56:59,908 --> 00:57:02,672
The Duck of Death is as good as dead...

657
00:57:03,411 --> 00:57:05,505
...because Corky does it right.

658
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:07,815
He aims real careful.

659
00:57:08,084 --> 00:57:09,574
No hurry...

660
00:57:12,522 --> 00:57:14,923
The Walker Colt blew up in his hand...

661
00:57:15,093 --> 00:57:17,584
...a failing common to that model.

662
00:57:18,596 --> 00:57:22,589
If Corky'd had two guns
instead of just a big dick...

663
00:57:23,935 --> 00:57:26,599
...he'd have defended
himself to the end.

664
00:57:27,106 --> 00:57:28,539
Wait a minute.

665
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,341
English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have...

666
00:57:33,613 --> 00:57:37,049
Bob wasn't going to wait for
Corky to grow a new hand.

667
00:57:37,717 --> 00:57:40,551
No, he just walked over
there real slow...

668
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,222
...'cause he's drunk...

669
00:57:45,627 --> 00:57:47,618
...and shot him through the liver.

670
00:58:07,914 --> 00:58:10,679
I don't like rocks on my dad-gum back.

671
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:14,852
- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.

672
00:58:15,021 --> 00:58:19,856
Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dad-gum bed!

673
00:58:21,094 --> 00:58:24,256
You'll miss your dad-gum
roof next, I suppose.

674
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:39,941
Will?

675
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:44,545
That business up in Jackson County...

676
00:58:44,783 --> 00:58:46,114
...that really happen?

677
00:58:46,618 --> 00:58:48,448
The way they say it happened?

678
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,380
What business?

679
00:58:53,057 --> 00:58:56,891
Two deputies up close pointing
their rifles right at you.

680
00:58:57,061 --> 00:58:58,892
Got you dead to rights.

681
00:58:59,297 --> 00:59:02,130
You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

682
00:59:02,733 --> 00:59:04,632
Only took a scratch yourself.

683
00:59:11,308 --> 00:59:16,143
Uncle Pete never seen nothing like you
shooting your way out of that scrape.

684
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,081
Well, I don't recollect.

685
00:59:26,423 --> 00:59:28,253
You don't recollect?

686
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:30,251
Right.

687
00:59:32,161 --> 00:59:33,253
Ned...

688
00:59:35,597 --> 00:59:38,088
...how many men you killed?

689
00:59:42,938 --> 00:59:44,768
Ain't you going to answer?

690
00:59:45,273 --> 00:59:47,104
What the hell's that to you?

691
00:59:49,944 --> 00:59:54,779
I got to know what kind of fellow I'm
riding with, case we get into a scrape.

692
00:59:58,286 --> 01:00:00,344
How many men you killed, Kid?

693
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:01,877
Five.

694
01:00:02,156 --> 01:00:03,145
How many?

695
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:06,948
Five.

696
01:00:08,028 --> 01:00:10,019
I done killed 5 of them.

697
01:00:11,698 --> 01:00:15,134
That's including a Mexican
who come at me with a knife.

698
01:00:15,468 --> 01:00:18,028
Why don't you shut up? Get some rest.

699
01:00:19,205 --> 01:00:22,369
You boys're as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.

700
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:26,471
Actually...

701
01:00:26,712 --> 01:00:30,375
...Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck...

702
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,480
Than English Bob?

703
01:00:32,651 --> 01:00:33,640
Faster?

704
01:00:33,818 --> 01:00:35,547
Faster was his mistake.

705
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,213
If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't
have shot himself in the toe.

706
01:00:39,392 --> 01:00:41,154
He would've killed old Bob.

707
01:00:44,829 --> 01:00:47,729
Being a good shot and being
quick with a pistol...

708
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:52,400
...don't do no harm, but it don't
mean much next to being cool-headed.

709
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:56,901
A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire...

710
01:00:57,408 --> 01:00:59,069
...like as not will kill you.

711
01:00:59,243 --> 01:01:01,507
But if the other fellow is quicker...

712
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:04,169
Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.

713
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:05,574
Look.

714
01:01:08,419 --> 01:01:13,185
That's as fast as I can draw, aim and
hit anything more than 10 feet away.

715
01:01:13,923 --> 01:01:15,584
'Less it's a barn.

716
01:01:16,192 --> 01:01:18,183
But if he doesn't miss?

717
01:01:20,028 --> 01:01:21,189
He'll kill you.

718
01:01:25,368 --> 01:01:28,859
That's why there's so few
dangerous men around like Bob.

719
01:01:30,072 --> 01:01:31,061
Like me.

720
01:01:32,274 --> 01:01:35,869
It ain't so easy to shoot a
man if he's shooting back.

721
01:01:36,111 --> 01:01:38,102
That'll flat rattle some folks.

722
01:01:40,048 --> 01:01:42,209
- I'll show you something.
- Wait.

723
01:01:42,451 --> 01:01:43,440
Look.

724
01:01:44,051 --> 01:01:45,109
Take that.

725
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:49,620
Take it.

726
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:55,618
There's the key.

727
01:01:56,797 --> 01:01:58,128
Just shoot me...

728
01:01:59,233 --> 01:02:02,724
...and you and Bob can ride
on out of here free as birds.

729
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:12,578
- Is it loaded?
- Wouldn't do any good if it wasn't.

730
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,473
You got to cock it.

731
01:02:21,588 --> 01:02:22,919
Cock it.

732
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,296
Point it.

733
01:02:36,602 --> 01:02:38,092
Go on. Point it.

734
01:02:47,445 --> 01:02:50,175
Now all you must do
is pull the trigger.

735
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:06,952
Hot, ain't it?

736
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:10,860
Your finger wasn't even on the trigger.

737
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:13,532
What if...

738
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:16,460
What if I gave it to him?

739
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:19,372
Do it.

740
01:03:27,883 --> 01:03:29,042
You don't...

741
01:03:29,217 --> 01:03:30,309
Do it.

742
01:04:31,944 --> 01:04:34,275
I guess he don't want it, Mr. Beauchamp.

743
01:04:56,233 --> 01:04:58,291
You were right not to take it.

744
01:04:58,568 --> 01:05:00,058
I'd have killed you.

745
01:05:18,988 --> 01:05:21,251
We could use some rain.

746
01:05:31,934 --> 01:05:34,664
You no-good goddamn
pig-fucking whore!

747
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:37,764
Sorry, horse.

748
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:52,176
I brung this for when
we kill them fellows.

749
01:05:52,453 --> 01:05:54,443
Figured we could use some now.

750
01:05:54,688 --> 01:05:57,282
Not me. I don't touch it no more.

751
01:05:57,524 --> 01:05:58,958
It's raining.

752
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:02,193
I know it's raining!
Give some to the Kid.

753
01:06:05,532 --> 01:06:08,296
You think that Kid really killed 5 men?

754
01:06:15,141 --> 01:06:19,975
When you talked about the time them
deputies had the drop on you and Pete...

755
01:06:23,482 --> 01:06:26,541
I remember there was
3 men you shot, not 2.

756
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:29,484
I ain't like that no more, Ned!

757
01:06:29,722 --> 01:06:32,213
I ain't no crazy killing fool.

758
01:06:34,726 --> 01:06:37,820
Still think it'll be easy
to kill them cowboys?

759
01:06:38,997 --> 01:06:41,226
If we don't drown first.

760
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,573
Give these keys to the conductor.

761
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:57,001
He can loose Bob's cuffs as soon
as he's outside the county.

762
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,009
Got my pistols?

763
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,513
I guess you know, Bob, that...

764
01:07:04,755 --> 01:07:08,246
...if I see you again I'll
just shoot in self-defense.

765
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:16,992
I didn't steal your biographer!

766
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,432
He's staying on his own account!

767
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:24,770
He can go stuff himself
as well, can't he?!

768
01:07:25,106 --> 01:07:28,201
A plague on the whole
stinking lot of you!

769
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,604
Without morals or laws!

770
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:34,715
And all you whores!
You got no laws and no honor!

771
01:07:35,116 --> 01:07:38,551
It's no wonder you all
emigrated to America!

772
01:07:39,053 --> 01:07:41,545
They wouldn't have you in England!

773
01:07:43,058 --> 01:07:44,958
You're a lot of savages!

774
01:07:45,126 --> 01:07:48,458
You're all a bunch of bloody
savages! A curse on you!

775
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:52,629
Nobody's going to come...

776
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,734
...after what Little Bill
done to that Englishman.

777
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:01,400
Delilah, can't you
get them tables clean?

778
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:06,407
Cover your face, somebody might hump
you and you wouldn't have to clean.

779
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:10,412
What do they call that face cover?

780
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:11,743
A veil.

781
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:13,647
Yeah. Get a veil!

782
01:08:23,095 --> 01:08:24,653
Rain's coming.

783
01:08:25,497 --> 01:08:26,930
Thank God.

784
01:08:52,455 --> 01:08:53,615
Sure?

785
01:09:05,634 --> 01:09:07,534
You all right, Will?

786
01:09:18,047 --> 01:09:19,537
Fellow asking for Alice.

787
01:09:20,049 --> 01:09:22,141
Tonight? You ain't joshing?

788
01:09:23,151 --> 01:09:24,710
This way, mister.

789
01:09:25,154 --> 01:09:27,987
Must be randy as hell to
come out in this shit.

790
01:09:38,231 --> 01:09:41,065
"No, no! You're wrong,
Little Bill!" he said.

791
01:09:41,235 --> 01:09:44,500
"That's not the Curly J.
That's a Bobbed J!"

792
01:09:45,073 --> 01:09:48,007
He had changed it over.
And I said to him...

793
01:09:48,241 --> 01:09:51,335
..."Jim, you're a liar
and a horse thief!"

794
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,841
He saw nobody would help him none.

795
01:09:56,016 --> 01:09:59,918
He went to start crying and
sobbing and just carrying on.

796
01:10:00,187 --> 01:10:03,519
He said, "God, please,
don't kill me, Bill!

797
01:10:03,756 --> 01:10:05,087
Please don't kill me!"

798
01:10:05,257 --> 01:10:07,191
I said, "It makes me sick..."

799
01:10:08,428 --> 01:10:09,917
Open the window.

800
01:10:10,529 --> 01:10:13,930
"...to see a man carrying two
pistols and a Henry rifle...

801
01:10:15,034 --> 01:10:16,763
...and crying like a damn baby."

802
01:10:16,936 --> 01:10:18,698
So... you killed him?

803
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:19,928
No.

804
01:10:20,371 --> 01:10:21,929
But I should have.

805
01:10:22,942 --> 01:10:24,876
I can't abide them kind.

806
01:10:25,111 --> 01:10:27,203
You see them in the taverns.

807
01:10:27,445 --> 01:10:29,777
Tramps and drunk teamsters.

808
01:10:30,115 --> 01:10:32,106
Crazed miners.

809
01:10:32,784 --> 01:10:36,275
Sporting their pistols and
acting like they was bad men.

810
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:40,557
But without any sand or character.
Not even any bad character.

811
01:10:44,228 --> 01:10:46,560
I do not like assassins.

812
01:10:47,965 --> 01:10:50,228
Or men of low character.

813
01:10:52,136 --> 01:10:53,569
Like English Bob.

814
01:10:54,138 --> 01:10:56,129
But Bob was no coward, you know.

815
01:10:56,573 --> 01:10:59,632
He wouldn't cry and carry on like that...

816
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:02,099
Sheriff...

817
01:11:03,412 --> 01:11:06,141
I don't have any more receptacles.

818
01:11:06,415 --> 01:11:08,474
Maybe you should just
hang the carpenter.

819
01:11:14,322 --> 01:11:17,416
I meant that because of
the... if you hang...

820
01:11:19,661 --> 01:11:20,924
Never mind.

821
01:11:23,098 --> 01:11:24,827
What the hell?

822
01:11:25,433 --> 01:11:27,333
On a night like this!

823
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:30,168
Who is it?

824
01:11:30,337 --> 01:11:32,498
Deputy Charley Hecker, Bill.

825
01:11:36,278 --> 01:11:40,771
Three fellows just come into town, Bill.
They're down to Greely's.

826
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:42,939
There's two of them got guns.

827
01:11:51,192 --> 01:11:53,456
What the hell's keeping that Kid?

828
01:11:55,295 --> 01:11:56,853
You suppose he's up...

829
01:12:00,466 --> 01:12:01,956
You look like shit.

830
01:12:06,472 --> 01:12:08,963
You remember Eagle Hendershot?

831
01:12:13,979 --> 01:12:15,310
I saw him.

832
01:12:16,982 --> 01:12:18,471
Will, he's dead.

833
01:12:19,317 --> 01:12:21,047
No, I saw him, Ned.

834
01:12:21,987 --> 01:12:25,320
His head was broke open.
You could see inside of it.

835
01:12:27,225 --> 01:12:28,214
Jesus.

836
01:12:28,492 --> 01:12:29,982
You got a fever.

837
01:12:30,394 --> 01:12:33,329
- Take your drink.
- Worms were coming out.

838
01:12:38,169 --> 01:12:40,000
I'll go find the Kid.

839
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:43,729
Must be he's getting an advance
on one of the sporting ladies.

840
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:48,502
If I was to...

841
01:12:50,347 --> 01:12:52,747
If it worked out that I could...

842
01:12:53,016 --> 01:12:56,008
...take a little time
for myself, would you...

843
01:13:02,024 --> 01:13:03,925
I guess you don't want to come.

844
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:28,433
Give me the pistol.

845
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,669
I says give me over your pistol.

846
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:41,784
I ain't drunk.

847
01:14:43,953 --> 01:14:47,685
Ordinance says you got to turn
in your firearms to my office...

848
01:14:48,459 --> 01:14:49,790
...day or night.

849
01:14:56,632 --> 01:14:59,964
I guess you didn't see the sign,
because of the weather.

850
01:15:01,971 --> 01:15:03,131
No.

851
01:15:04,474 --> 01:15:07,135
But I ain't armed.

852
01:15:09,144 --> 01:15:11,874
Your friends upstairs got any pistols?

853
01:15:17,652 --> 01:15:19,210
They ain't armed either.

854
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:22,979
Spilled your whiskey.

855
01:15:24,992 --> 01:15:26,391
What's your name?

856
01:15:28,329 --> 01:15:29,661
William...

857
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,560
...Hendershot.

858
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:39,728
Well, Mr. William Hendershot...

859
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:45,178
...what if I was to say
you was a no-good liar?

860
01:15:48,348 --> 01:15:52,682
And if I was to say you shit in your
pants because of a cowardly soul...

861
01:15:53,753 --> 01:15:57,244
...I bet you'd show me that pistol
right quick and shoot me dead.

862
01:15:57,423 --> 01:15:58,685
Is that so?

863
01:16:05,764 --> 01:16:07,527
Maybe, I guess.

864
01:16:09,601 --> 01:16:10,932
But the fact...

865
01:16:11,536 --> 01:16:12,867
...is I ain't...

866
01:16:13,037 --> 01:16:14,767
...carrying no firearm.

867
01:16:15,107 --> 01:16:16,267
Get up.

868
01:16:49,406 --> 01:16:51,737
What's this for, snakes and such?

869
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:56,977
We don't have any snakes
in here, Mr. Hendershot.

870
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:03,741
It ain't loaded.

871
01:17:05,588 --> 01:17:06,577
Powder's wet.

872
01:17:09,824 --> 01:17:11,485
You see, Mr. Beauchamp?

873
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,488
Such is the trash I spoke of!

874
01:17:24,638 --> 01:17:26,265
They're in all the saloons...

875
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,671
...in all your prosperous communities!

876
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:30,108
Wichita!

877
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,071
Over in Cheyenne!

878
01:17:38,685 --> 01:17:39,844
Abilene!

879
01:17:43,457 --> 01:17:45,948
But not in the town of Big Whiskey.

880
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:52,119
Hurry!

881
01:17:52,298 --> 01:17:53,959
Know what to tell Little Bill?

882
01:17:54,133 --> 01:17:56,533
Look sharp for that lone pine.

883
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:58,201
Don't miss it.

884
01:17:58,371 --> 01:18:00,305
Not the shirt! Put his boots on!

885
01:18:10,315 --> 01:18:12,875
What are we going to do about Will?

886
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:16,484
Come on! Let's hope them
horses are still there!

887
01:18:50,853 --> 01:18:52,911
Let the man out, W.W.

888
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:58,020
He's desiring to leave the
hospitality of Big Whiskey behind him.

889
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:34,291
Easy. She's got to be able
to turn a dollar a time!

890
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:37,223
How come they lit out the back window?

891
01:19:37,464 --> 01:19:40,058
They seen you beating on their friend.

892
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,959
They just come for
the billiards, honest.

893
01:19:43,136 --> 01:19:44,125
Billiards?!

894
01:19:46,139 --> 01:19:48,470
They just passing through here?

895
01:19:48,741 --> 01:19:50,265
Going to Fort Buford.

896
01:19:50,442 --> 01:19:53,412
You kicked the shit
out of an innocent man.

897
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,140
Innocent?

898
01:19:55,482 --> 01:19:56,971
Innocent of what?

899
01:20:26,177 --> 01:20:27,940
You done this before?

900
01:20:29,346 --> 01:20:30,938
Plenty of times.

901
01:20:32,683 --> 01:20:34,617
His pistol must've jammed.

902
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,181
Bring that candle in closer.

903
01:20:39,356 --> 01:20:40,618
I can't see.

904
01:20:52,301 --> 01:20:55,134
He wouldn't take no beating
if it hadn't jammed.

905
01:20:56,472 --> 01:20:59,032
He wouldn't give it over and not shoot.

906
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:04,974
He don't look so good.

907
01:21:07,049 --> 01:21:08,982
He didn't even pull his pistol?

908
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:11,050
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.

909
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:13,050
I'd have pulled my pistol.

910
01:21:13,221 --> 01:21:14,381
You did!

911
01:21:14,556 --> 01:21:16,489
Out of the lady and out the window!

912
01:21:16,657 --> 01:21:19,490
- That was your idea! I wanted to...
- We must go.

913
01:21:19,727 --> 01:21:23,061
Already? Darling, I'm
ready for another advance.

914
01:21:23,231 --> 01:21:26,722
- You'll use it all up.
- No more advances on what you ain't done.

915
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:31,166
Sweetheart, we're just waiting
on this weather to clear!

916
01:21:31,739 --> 01:21:33,399
We'll need more food!

917
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,501
3 days' worth.

918
01:21:35,843 --> 01:21:37,504
3 days?

919
01:21:38,345 --> 01:21:41,677
- We'll kill them tomorrow.
- I don't kill nobody without him.

920
01:21:41,848 --> 01:21:44,510
We don't need him! We can do it.

921
01:21:46,252 --> 01:21:49,015
He ain't nothing but a
broken-down pig farmer.

922
01:21:49,588 --> 01:21:53,081
One of us'll bring food and
some whiskey in the morning!

923
01:21:53,259 --> 01:21:55,420
And some medicine if you got any!

924
01:21:56,928 --> 01:21:59,260
Don't it make you sick hearing him?

925
01:21:59,531 --> 01:22:01,260
Don't you ladies worry!

926
01:22:02,434 --> 01:22:05,870
Me and Ned will kill them two
sons-of-bitches for you!

927
01:22:12,777 --> 01:22:14,267
Claudia.

928
01:22:22,953 --> 01:22:24,443
She's not here.

929
01:22:24,622 --> 01:22:26,214
Is that you, Ned?

930
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:29,390
I've seen him.

931
01:22:32,462 --> 01:22:34,727
I saw the Angel of Death.

932
01:22:35,299 --> 01:22:37,892
I've seen the river, Ned.

933
01:22:38,468 --> 01:22:40,299
He's got snake eyes.

934
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:42,631
Who's got snake eyes?

935
01:22:43,406 --> 01:22:45,464
It's the Angel of Death.

936
01:22:48,812 --> 01:22:51,474
Ned, I'm scared of dying.

937
01:22:52,148 --> 01:22:53,808
Easy, partner.

938
01:22:54,483 --> 01:22:56,474
I seen Claudia too.

939
01:22:57,252 --> 01:23:00,585
That's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?

940
01:23:00,922 --> 01:23:03,585
Her face was all covered with worms.

941
01:23:04,259 --> 01:23:05,920
Ned, I'm scared.

942
01:23:07,329 --> 01:23:08,818
I'm dying.

943
01:23:13,668 --> 01:23:15,829
No, don't tell nobody.

944
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:18,170
Don't tell my kids...

945
01:23:18,606 --> 01:23:21,336
...none of the things I did. Hear me?

946
01:23:23,277 --> 01:23:24,608
All right.

947
01:23:41,961 --> 01:23:43,861
He's gonna die, ain't he?

948
01:23:45,197 --> 01:23:46,289
Maybe.

949
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,190
Suppose he does?

950
01:23:52,972 --> 01:23:54,530
We'll bury him.

951
01:23:54,874 --> 01:23:56,865
That ain't what I mean.

952
01:24:00,211 --> 01:24:03,045
You mean will I help
you kill them cowboys?

953
01:24:05,049 --> 01:24:07,142
I can't spot them myself.

954
01:24:07,385 --> 01:24:08,977
But you could.

955
01:24:09,654 --> 01:24:13,384
You could spot that big
bastard a half-mile off.

956
01:24:15,058 --> 01:24:16,720
And if I spot him?

957
01:24:18,062 --> 01:24:20,394
Then I ride up close and shoot him.

958
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,899
Just like that?

959
01:24:25,235 --> 01:24:27,897
I'm a damn killer. I done it before.

960
01:24:30,907 --> 01:24:33,172
I'm more of a killer than he is.

961
01:25:02,871 --> 01:25:04,771
I thought you was an angel.

962
01:25:06,775 --> 01:25:08,436
You ain't dead.

963
01:25:16,718 --> 01:25:18,378
Some big fellow...

964
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:21,614
...kicked the hell out of me.

965
01:25:24,391 --> 01:25:26,722
I must look like you now.

966
01:25:28,728 --> 01:25:31,061
You don't look nothing like me.

967
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,628
No offense meant.

968
01:25:37,236 --> 01:25:39,796
It was you those cowboys cut up.

969
01:25:46,813 --> 01:25:49,474
My partners, Ned and that Kid...

970
01:25:49,915 --> 01:25:50,973
...they around?

971
01:25:52,417 --> 01:25:55,580
They went out scouting
when your fever broke.

972
01:25:56,488 --> 01:25:57,647
Scouting?

973
01:25:58,489 --> 01:26:00,481
Out to the Bar T...

974
01:26:00,759 --> 01:26:02,750
...looking for them.

975
01:26:06,764 --> 01:26:08,664
How long I been here?

976
01:26:09,767 --> 01:26:11,257
Three days.

977
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,499
Are you hungry or...

978
01:26:15,106 --> 01:26:17,006
Three days?

979
01:26:17,174 --> 01:26:18,766
I should be.

980
01:26:31,021 --> 01:26:32,852
I thought I was gone.

981
01:26:35,859 --> 01:26:40,192
I wouldn't normally pay no notice
to high country like this.

982
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:43,458
Trees. But I'm sure noticing now.

983
01:26:44,467 --> 01:26:46,627
Thought I was dying for sure.

984
01:26:48,804 --> 01:26:50,533
I brought your hat.

985
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,140
You left it down at Greely's.

986
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,202
Thanks.

987
01:26:57,145 --> 01:26:58,545
That sheriff...

988
01:26:59,815 --> 01:27:01,305
...still looking for me?

989
01:27:01,483 --> 01:27:02,813
Little Bill?

990
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:05,646
No, he thinks you went south.

991
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:11,552
Are you really going
to kill them cowboys?

992
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:14,158
I guess.

993
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:17,157
Still a payment coming, isn't there?

994
01:27:18,999 --> 01:27:21,399
The other two, your friends...

995
01:27:22,235 --> 01:27:25,227
...they're taking
advances on the payment.

996
01:27:26,172 --> 01:27:27,663
Advances?

997
01:27:29,576 --> 01:27:31,168
Free ones.

998
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,514
Alice and Silky been
giving them free ones.

999
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:39,681
I see.

1000
01:27:43,355 --> 01:27:45,516
Would you like a free one?

1001
01:27:55,433 --> 01:27:56,867
I guess not.

1002
01:27:57,770 --> 01:28:01,102
I didn't mean with me. I meant...

1003
01:28:01,706 --> 01:28:04,607
...Alice and Silky would
give you a free one...

1004
01:28:04,776 --> 01:28:06,436
...if you wanted.

1005
01:28:06,777 --> 01:28:08,870
That's all I meant.

1006
01:28:12,884 --> 01:28:16,876
I didn't mean I didn't want a
free one because you been cut up.

1007
01:28:17,888 --> 01:28:21,619
What I said about you
looking like me ain't true.

1008
01:28:22,225 --> 01:28:24,216
You ain't ugly like me.

1009
01:28:25,462 --> 01:28:28,295
It's just that we both have scars.

1010
01:28:31,234 --> 01:28:34,795
You're a beautiful woman and
if I wanted a free one...

1011
01:28:35,071 --> 01:28:38,562
...I'd want it with you
more than the other two.

1012
01:28:40,977 --> 01:28:42,410
It's just that...

1013
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:45,479
...I can't on account of my wife.

1014
01:28:52,254 --> 01:28:53,414
Your wife?

1015
01:29:02,496 --> 01:29:04,327
I admire you for that...

1016
01:29:04,999 --> 01:29:06,591
...being true to your wife.

1017
01:29:08,435 --> 01:29:10,494
I've known a lot of men...

1018
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,273
...who weren't.

1019
01:29:16,610 --> 01:29:18,168
I suppose.

1020
01:29:24,618 --> 01:29:26,448
Is she back in Kansas?

1021
01:29:30,523 --> 01:29:33,185
She's watching over my young ones.

1022
01:29:38,297 --> 01:29:39,526
Hang on!

1023
01:29:39,699 --> 01:29:41,690
Get the damn iron!

1024
01:30:04,889 --> 01:30:07,379
Jesus, boys, my leg's broke!

1025
01:30:09,227 --> 01:30:11,218
I'm pinned, boys!

1026
01:30:12,230 --> 01:30:13,891
Better finish him.

1027
01:30:14,397 --> 01:30:16,729
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?

1028
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,561
He got the boy's horse.

1029
01:30:19,402 --> 01:30:21,836
Finish him before he gets clear.

1030
01:30:24,574 --> 01:30:26,508
Get behind them rocks.

1031
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:28,571
Get over there!

1032
01:30:31,747 --> 01:30:34,580
What happened?
He ain't killed?!

1033
01:30:35,017 --> 01:30:36,075
What's going on?

1034
01:30:36,352 --> 01:30:38,912
He gets in those rocks,
we won't get him.

1035
01:30:39,188 --> 01:30:41,748
- Unless we go down there.
- What rocks?

1036
01:30:42,024 --> 01:30:44,925
Why don't you shoot?
What's going on?

1037
01:30:49,697 --> 01:30:50,925
Shoot!

1038
01:31:04,444 --> 01:31:06,709
I ain't very good with one of these.

1039
01:31:12,452 --> 01:31:14,943
Keep going, Davey! The rocks!

1040
01:31:17,124 --> 01:31:18,284
Get him?

1041
01:31:19,225 --> 01:31:20,556
Where is he?

1042
01:31:20,793 --> 01:31:23,058
How many more shots do I have?

1043
01:31:24,965 --> 01:31:27,899
How many more shots do I have?

1044
01:31:31,304 --> 01:31:32,396
Two.

1045
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:45,648
Did you get him?

1046
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,992
Here, reload this.

1047
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:08,503
- You missed him.
- I got him.

1048
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:13,842
He ain't killed.

1049
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:16,275
Maybe, maybe not.

1050
01:32:16,846 --> 01:32:19,007
Got him through the gut, I think.

1051
01:32:23,453 --> 01:32:25,182
Think he'll die?

1052
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:28,821
We killed him?

1053
01:32:39,534 --> 01:32:40,865
We killed him...

1054
01:32:41,203 --> 01:32:42,534
...I guess.

1055
01:32:46,475 --> 01:32:48,465
I'm dying, boys!

1056
01:32:49,044 --> 01:32:52,707
Then you shouldn't have cut
up no woman, you asshole!

1057
01:32:58,386 --> 01:33:00,650
Jesus, I'm so thirsty.

1058
01:33:05,059 --> 01:33:07,152
Give me some water, please!

1059
01:33:07,495 --> 01:33:08,826
Please, Slim!

1060
01:33:09,997 --> 01:33:11,725
I'm bleeding, Slim!

1061
01:33:15,902 --> 01:33:18,667
Give him a drink of water, goddamn it!

1062
01:33:22,742 --> 01:33:26,838
Give him some water, for chrissake!
We ain't going to shoot!

1063
01:33:28,847 --> 01:33:30,246
You won't?

1064
01:33:34,254 --> 01:33:36,016
Hold on, Davey-boy!

1065
01:33:37,189 --> 01:33:38,747
Here I come now!

1066
01:33:45,196 --> 01:33:47,187
Don't shoot, you bastards!

1067
01:33:50,769 --> 01:33:52,099
Shit!

1068
01:34:01,946 --> 01:34:03,436
They take him water?

1069
01:34:06,284 --> 01:34:08,615
Jesus, Johnny! They shot him!

1070
01:34:08,785 --> 01:34:10,446
Hold on now!

1071
01:34:19,129 --> 01:34:22,724
You murdering bastards!
You killed our Davey-boy!

1072
01:34:31,574 --> 01:34:33,474
When do we double back?

1073
01:34:34,143 --> 01:34:35,974
After a ways.

1074
01:34:37,246 --> 01:34:38,474
Not me.

1075
01:34:39,315 --> 01:34:41,578
I'm heading back down to Kansas.

1076
01:34:41,749 --> 01:34:43,910
We must kill the other one first.

1077
01:34:44,819 --> 01:34:49,153
With any luck, we'll find him
by nightfall or in the morning.

1078
01:34:49,324 --> 01:34:51,986
We'll shoot him and head
back with the money.

1079
01:34:54,162 --> 01:34:55,753
Want the Spencer?

1080
01:34:55,929 --> 01:34:57,760
It's no time to quit.

1081
01:34:57,931 --> 01:35:00,092
- You'll lose your share.
- Shut up!

1082
01:35:00,334 --> 01:35:03,099
I'll see you, Will. So long, Kid.

1083
01:35:12,445 --> 01:35:15,108
I ain't no good with that damn thing.

1084
01:35:15,616 --> 01:35:20,450
Me and the Kid'll go over to that ranch
and when we find him we'll shoot him.

1085
01:35:20,786 --> 01:35:24,517
We'll meet up with you, get our
money, and head south together.

1086
01:35:25,291 --> 01:35:27,690
Suppose he don't go back to the ranch?

1087
01:35:28,126 --> 01:35:32,120
He ain't going into town.
He won't stay out in the open country.

1088
01:35:32,298 --> 01:35:34,630
He'll hole up at that ranch.

1089
01:35:36,301 --> 01:35:37,859
I ain't waiting.

1090
01:35:38,303 --> 01:35:40,965
I'll look in on your young ones.

1091
01:35:47,646 --> 01:35:50,547
Forget what the Kid said
about the money and all.

1092
01:35:50,715 --> 01:35:52,045
I'll bring yours.

1093
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:57,881
Kid's full of shit.

1094
01:36:26,048 --> 01:36:28,313
Doing some repairs up here.

1095
01:36:28,551 --> 01:36:30,485
They killed one of them cowboys.

1096
01:36:34,489 --> 01:36:35,820
Shit.

1097
01:36:37,226 --> 01:36:41,719
Parsons said he saw three men,
right after sun-up, headed east.

1098
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:46,565
One was on a dun and another
was on a flea-bitten grey.

1099
01:36:47,236 --> 01:36:51,228
He didn't know what the third
one was on, maybe an Appaloosa.

1100
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:55,903
Amos says to ask if the county will
pay for feed for all the horses.

1101
01:36:56,076 --> 01:36:59,513
Witherspoon won't sell us no more
.30-30 shells without we pay.

1102
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,170
Use my dogs.

1103
01:37:01,349 --> 01:37:03,749
Then the county must
take responsibility.

1104
01:37:04,517 --> 01:37:09,011
Fatty, get on out there to the Bar
T and make sure that other cowboy...

1105
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:11,918
...stays put and don't expose himself.

1106
01:37:21,867 --> 01:37:24,267
I didn't think they'd really do it.

1107
01:37:24,703 --> 01:37:27,696
Think they come clear
from Kansas to fuck us?

1108
01:37:31,210 --> 01:37:34,202
But that Kid's just a
boy and the other one...

1109
01:37:34,713 --> 01:37:37,704
...Will, the nice one, being
so true to his wife...

1110
01:37:37,949 --> 01:37:40,440
Wife? He ain't got no wife.

1111
01:37:40,885 --> 01:37:43,878
- Yes, he does. He said...
- He ain't got no wife.

1112
01:37:44,222 --> 01:37:46,213
Not above ground, anyways.

1113
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:53,719
Murdering whores!

1114
01:37:54,798 --> 01:37:56,391
He had it coming...

1115
01:37:56,634 --> 01:37:58,295
...for what he done.

1116
01:37:58,569 --> 01:37:59,968
And the other one too!

1117
01:38:00,138 --> 01:38:02,469
Both of them for what they done!

1118
01:38:12,582 --> 01:38:14,072
We got one!

1119
01:38:16,419 --> 01:38:19,149
We got one, Sheriff! Out by Cow Creek!

1120
01:38:19,322 --> 01:38:20,653
Is he alive?

1121
01:38:20,823 --> 01:38:24,314
Yeah! Bunch of us from
Bar T went out looking...

1122
01:38:24,492 --> 01:38:26,757
...'cause they killed one of our own.

1123
01:38:26,996 --> 01:38:30,261
Come across the bastard
on a roan heading south.

1124
01:38:30,499 --> 01:38:31,830
He admit it?

1125
01:38:32,101 --> 01:38:36,264
No. But I guess he will soon enough.
Had a Spencer rifle on him.

1126
01:38:36,938 --> 01:38:38,496
They messing him up?

1127
01:38:40,009 --> 01:38:41,600
Little bit.

1128
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:49,275
Get out there. Find out what
happened to those other two!

1129
01:39:12,139 --> 01:39:14,470
See anything out there, Buck?

1130
01:39:14,807 --> 01:39:18,641
Hell, yes! Seen about 200
fellows packing rifles.

1131
01:39:18,978 --> 01:39:22,538
Got the place surrounded.
Say they want Quick Mike's ass.

1132
01:39:23,315 --> 01:39:26,717
I said, "How much?" They says,
"Five." I said, "Dollars?"

1133
01:39:26,886 --> 01:39:28,217
They said, "Cents."

1134
01:39:28,388 --> 01:39:29,979
I said, "Sold."

1135
01:39:31,556 --> 01:39:33,319
Well, I ain't worried!

1136
01:39:33,558 --> 01:39:35,890
'Cause I got me some protection.

1137
01:40:01,584 --> 01:40:03,575
- Tell you where them others is?
- Nope.

1138
01:40:03,753 --> 01:40:04,913
Names?

1139
01:40:05,188 --> 01:40:07,919
Only told us his name, Ned Roundtree.

1140
01:40:10,427 --> 01:40:11,758
Bring him in.

1141
01:40:14,697 --> 01:40:17,597
You'll want to tell me
and Mr. Beauchamp here...

1142
01:40:18,267 --> 01:40:20,599
...all about your two
villainous friends.

1143
01:40:21,203 --> 01:40:25,367
I'll want the names and whereabouts
of those murderous son-of-a-bitches.

1144
01:40:40,122 --> 01:40:41,884
Sure is ripe.

1145
01:40:43,458 --> 01:40:45,392
Going to get a lot riper.

1146
01:40:46,727 --> 01:40:48,388
Think he's still in there?

1147
01:40:49,896 --> 01:40:51,227
He's in there.

1148
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:55,563
He's holding on to his
shit like it was money.

1149
01:40:56,404 --> 01:40:57,893
He's in there.

1150
01:40:58,305 --> 01:41:00,569
Tell me right off if you see him.

1151
01:41:02,909 --> 01:41:05,069
You won't shoot him your own self?

1152
01:41:05,478 --> 01:41:07,071
You can shoot him.

1153
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:49,783
You, Mr. Quincy and...
what was the young fellow's name?

1154
01:41:54,291 --> 01:41:55,781
Elroy Tate.

1155
01:42:00,697 --> 01:42:03,187
No, that's not what you said.

1156
01:42:03,533 --> 01:42:04,693
It is.

1157
01:42:04,968 --> 01:42:06,629
No, you said...

1158
01:42:07,137 --> 01:42:09,969
..."Elroy Quincy out
of Medicine Hat and...

1159
01:42:11,641 --> 01:42:13,632
...Henry Tate out of Cheyenne."

1160
01:42:14,877 --> 01:42:16,367
Hell if I did.

1161
01:42:17,312 --> 01:42:18,802
Hell if I did.

1162
01:42:20,983 --> 01:42:24,316
Go get them whores that
fucked these boys that night.

1163
01:42:24,487 --> 01:42:26,647
Strawberry Alice and Silky?

1164
01:42:26,888 --> 01:42:28,651
Go on and get them!

1165
01:42:37,732 --> 01:42:40,997
Them whores will tell
different lies than you.

1166
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:46,164
And when their lies ain't
the same as your lies...

1167
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:50,567
I ain't going to hurt no woman.

1168
01:42:51,845 --> 01:42:53,745
But I will hurt you.

1169
01:42:56,350 --> 01:42:58,340
Not gentle like before...

1170
01:42:59,919 --> 01:43:01,511
...but bad.

1171
01:43:18,237 --> 01:43:19,397
Where you going?

1172
01:43:19,606 --> 01:43:22,199
- The shithouse.
- Let me finish this hand.

1173
01:43:22,374 --> 01:43:24,433
To protect me while I take a dump?

1174
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:26,874
- You'll get bushwhacked.
- I'll fart on them.

1175
01:43:27,112 --> 01:43:30,205
- I'll go with him.
- You can wipe my ass, Thirsty.

1176
01:43:30,448 --> 01:43:33,782
Hell with him. He ain't
polite, he should get shot.

1177
01:43:37,788 --> 01:43:38,880
That him?

1178
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:40,948
Yeah, it's him.

1179
01:43:44,795 --> 01:43:47,228
Go get him. He's all yours.

1180
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:25,326
Assassins!

1181
01:44:29,137 --> 01:44:30,001
Shoot!

1182
01:44:46,287 --> 01:44:47,948
Come on, goddamn it!

1183
01:45:05,038 --> 01:45:06,368
Get him?

1184
01:45:19,318 --> 01:45:20,307
Cover me.

1185
01:45:22,887 --> 01:45:24,980
- I can't see them!
- Just shoot!

1186
01:45:35,333 --> 01:45:36,823
Get him!

1187
01:46:02,358 --> 01:46:04,758
Was it like that in the old days?

1188
01:46:05,595 --> 01:46:07,756
Everybody riding out, shooting...

1189
01:46:08,598 --> 01:46:12,533
...smoke all over, folks yelling,
bullets whizzing by?

1190
01:46:14,370 --> 01:46:15,769
I guess so.

1191
01:46:19,775 --> 01:46:22,369
Shit, I thought they'd get us.

1192
01:46:23,445 --> 01:46:25,538
I was even scared a little.

1193
01:46:25,781 --> 01:46:27,111
For a minute.

1194
01:46:29,785 --> 01:46:31,878
You ever scared in them days?

1195
01:46:34,055 --> 01:46:35,544
I can't remember.

1196
01:46:36,791 --> 01:46:39,055
I was drunk most of the time.

1197
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,394
I shot that fucker three times!

1198
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:52,904
He went for his pistol
and I blazed away.

1199
01:46:53,807 --> 01:46:55,138
First shot...

1200
01:46:57,076 --> 01:46:58,805
...I got him right in the chest.

1201
01:47:08,487 --> 01:47:09,977
That was the first.

1202
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:12,822
First what?

1203
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,160
First one I ever killed.

1204
01:47:21,099 --> 01:47:23,589
I know I said I shot five men.

1205
01:47:24,936 --> 01:47:26,597
It weren't true.

1206
01:47:28,941 --> 01:47:31,170
That Mexican who had a knife...

1207
01:47:32,343 --> 01:47:34,436
...I busted his leg with a shovel.

1208
01:47:34,679 --> 01:47:36,670
I didn't kill him or nothing.

1209
01:47:40,116 --> 01:47:43,109
You killed the hell out
of that fellow today.

1210
01:47:45,356 --> 01:47:46,686
Hell, yeah!

1211
01:47:50,293 --> 01:47:52,454
I killed the hell out of him!

1212
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:56,192
Three shots while he took a shit...

1213
01:48:03,138 --> 01:48:04,537
Take a drink.

1214
01:48:29,664 --> 01:48:31,325
It don't seem real.

1215
01:48:33,167 --> 01:48:35,828
How he won't never breathe again, ever.

1216
01:48:37,237 --> 01:48:38,670
How he's dead.

1217
01:48:40,408 --> 01:48:42,000
And the other one too.

1218
01:48:44,845 --> 01:48:47,075
On account of pulling a trigger.

1219
01:48:50,017 --> 01:48:52,348
It's a hell of a thing, killing a man.

1220
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,421
You take away all he's got...

1221
01:48:57,524 --> 01:48:59,514
...and all he'll ever have.

1222
01:49:05,197 --> 01:49:07,027
I guess they had it coming.

1223
01:49:13,205 --> 01:49:15,195
We all have it coming, Kid.

1224
01:49:30,055 --> 01:49:33,046
I was watching you.
You weren't followed.

1225
01:49:34,391 --> 01:49:38,384
Silky and Faith rode off to the east
and two deputies followed them.

1226
01:49:45,302 --> 01:49:47,394
Want to help me count this?

1227
01:49:47,570 --> 01:49:50,903
- I trust you.
- Don't go trusting me too much.

1228
01:49:52,408 --> 01:49:55,741
In fact, we'll give
Ned his share together.

1229
01:49:55,912 --> 01:49:58,403
You'll know I ain't holding out on you.

1230
01:49:58,748 --> 01:50:00,147
Ned's share?

1231
01:50:03,151 --> 01:50:05,312
He went south. We'll catch up.

1232
01:50:05,921 --> 01:50:07,582
He's dead.

1233
01:50:11,093 --> 01:50:12,651
What do you mean?

1234
01:50:13,929 --> 01:50:16,659
He went south yesterday. He ain't dead.

1235
01:50:17,265 --> 01:50:19,926
They killed him. I thought you knew.

1236
01:50:20,101 --> 01:50:22,092
Nobody killed Ned!

1237
01:50:22,269 --> 01:50:24,830
He didn't kill anyone, he went south!

1238
01:50:25,007 --> 01:50:27,100
Why would anybody kill Ned?

1239
01:50:29,877 --> 01:50:31,139
Who killed him?

1240
01:50:31,846 --> 01:50:33,177
Little Bill.

1241
01:50:33,447 --> 01:50:36,006
The boys caught him. Little Bill...

1242
01:50:36,983 --> 01:50:38,315
...beat him up.

1243
01:50:38,486 --> 01:50:43,150
He was making him answer questions and
beating him up, then Ned just died.

1244
01:50:43,790 --> 01:50:46,520
They got a sign on him
says he was a killer.

1245
01:50:46,693 --> 01:50:48,024
A sign?

1246
01:50:48,695 --> 01:50:50,356
In front of Greely's.

1247
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:52,794
A sign on him in front of Greely's!

1248
01:50:57,303 --> 01:50:59,702
These questions he was asking...

1249
01:51:00,873 --> 01:51:02,204
...what were they?

1250
01:51:06,846 --> 01:51:09,245
About where you and him was.

1251
01:51:09,548 --> 01:51:10,879
Then what?

1252
01:51:11,884 --> 01:51:16,320
A cowboy come in saying you killed
Quick Mike in the shithouse at the Bar T.

1253
01:51:17,321 --> 01:51:20,313
So Little Bill killed
him for what we done?

1254
01:51:20,558 --> 01:51:22,220
Not on purpose.

1255
01:51:22,661 --> 01:51:24,719
But he started hurting him worse.

1256
01:51:24,896 --> 01:51:26,727
Making him tell stuff.

1257
01:51:26,998 --> 01:51:28,488
First, Ned wouldn't talk.

1258
01:51:29,333 --> 01:51:33,166
Then Little Bill hurt him so
bad, he said who you was.

1259
01:51:35,172 --> 01:51:38,665
He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri...

1260
01:51:39,409 --> 01:51:42,242
Little Bill said, "The
same William Munny...

1261
01:51:42,512 --> 01:51:46,004
...who dynamited the railroad in '69,
killing women and children?"

1262
01:51:46,249 --> 01:51:48,842
Ned said you done a lot worse and was...

1263
01:51:49,418 --> 01:51:51,853
...more cold-blooded
than William Bonney.

1264
01:51:52,022 --> 01:51:55,355
Said if he hurt Ned again,
you'd come kill him...

1265
01:51:55,524 --> 01:51:58,357
...like you killed the
U.S. Marshal in '70.

1266
01:52:03,365 --> 01:52:05,595
That didn't scare him, did it?

1267
01:52:07,536 --> 01:52:08,867
No, sir.

1268
01:52:16,778 --> 01:52:18,439
Give me your Schofield.

1269
01:52:18,947 --> 01:52:20,209
Why?

1270
01:52:20,381 --> 01:52:21,370
Give it.

1271
01:52:28,789 --> 01:52:30,279
You keep it.

1272
01:52:30,891 --> 01:52:32,290
I won't use it.

1273
01:52:34,796 --> 01:52:36,888
I won't kill nobody no more.

1274
01:52:40,467 --> 01:52:42,128
I ain't like you, Will.

1275
01:52:46,139 --> 01:52:48,130
You better ride on back, Miss.

1276
01:52:52,812 --> 01:52:55,246
Keep all of it. It's yours.

1277
01:52:56,249 --> 01:52:59,582
What about spectacles
and fancy clothes?

1278
01:53:00,418 --> 01:53:03,148
I'd rather be blind
and ragged than dead.

1279
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:06,490
You don't have to worry, Kid.

1280
01:53:06,659 --> 01:53:08,489
I ain't going to kill you.

1281
01:53:09,094 --> 01:53:11,255
You're the only friend I got.

1282
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:21,572
Take this money and give my share...

1283
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,671
...and Ned's share to my kids.

1284
01:53:24,175 --> 01:53:27,838
Tell them if I ain't back in a week,
to give half to Sally Two Trees.

1285
01:53:28,012 --> 01:53:30,776
You keep the rest. Get them spectacles.

1286
01:53:30,981 --> 01:53:32,812
You'll go kill Little Bill?

1287
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:35,516
Stay clear of folks you see.

1288
01:53:35,686 --> 01:53:37,347
A lot will want to hang you.

1289
01:53:37,688 --> 01:53:39,019
Get going.

1290
01:54:23,303 --> 01:54:27,296
I'll say this just one more
time, so don't ask me again!

1291
01:54:27,808 --> 01:54:32,212
Those on the posse today got one
drink coming from the county budget!

1292
01:54:34,382 --> 01:54:37,646
And those who rode
yesterday get another drink.

1293
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:40,480
Hold it!

1294
01:54:40,989 --> 01:54:42,388
That's two!

1295
01:54:42,657 --> 01:54:45,557
After that, it comes
out of your own pocket!

1296
01:54:45,827 --> 01:54:48,490
We'll pull out early in the morning.

1297
01:54:48,731 --> 01:54:53,064
We'll chase them clear to Texas,
so don't spend too much money.

1298
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:56,664
We'll divide up into four parties!

1299
01:54:56,906 --> 01:54:59,397
We'll hit all the farms and trails...

1300
01:54:59,575 --> 01:55:01,065
...in a big circle.

1301
01:55:01,344 --> 01:55:03,244
We're bound to find somebody...

1302
01:55:03,413 --> 01:55:05,574
...who seen these skunks.

1303
01:55:22,934 --> 01:55:25,198
Who owns this shithole?

1304
01:55:34,713 --> 01:55:36,112
Fat man.

1305
01:55:36,548 --> 01:55:37,879
Speak up.

1306
01:55:40,453 --> 01:55:42,443
I own this establishment.

1307
01:55:45,892 --> 01:55:49,225
I bought it from Greely
for a thousand dollars.

1308
01:55:50,897 --> 01:55:52,455
Clear out of there.

1309
01:55:55,402 --> 01:55:56,891
Hold it!

1310
01:56:07,648 --> 01:56:10,413
Sir, you are a cowardly son-of-a-bitch!

1311
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,648
You just shot an unarmed man.

1312
01:56:14,256 --> 01:56:19,092
He should've armed himself if he's going
to decorate his saloon with my friend.

1313
01:56:19,929 --> 01:56:22,488
You'd be William Munny
out of Missouri...

1314
01:56:22,998 --> 01:56:24,932
...killer of women and children.

1315
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:26,832
That's right.

1316
01:56:28,839 --> 01:56:30,669
I've killed women and children.

1317
01:56:32,341 --> 01:56:35,937
I killed just about everything
that walks or crawls.

1318
01:56:37,446 --> 01:56:39,846
And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill.

1319
01:56:40,951 --> 01:56:42,782
For what you did to Ned.

1320
01:56:47,457 --> 01:56:49,289
You boys better move away.

1321
01:56:59,638 --> 01:57:01,037
Gentlemen...

1322
01:57:01,639 --> 01:57:03,869
...he's got one barrel left.

1323
01:57:04,810 --> 01:57:07,142
When he fires that, use your pistols...

1324
01:57:07,313 --> 01:57:10,304
...and shoot him down like
the mangy scoundrel he is!

1325
01:57:24,664 --> 01:57:27,225
Misfire! Kill the son-of-a-bitch!

1326
01:58:03,706 --> 01:58:07,870
Any man don't want to get killed,
better clear on out the back.

1327
01:58:52,426 --> 01:58:54,325
I'm shot! I've been shot!

1328
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:56,151
You ain't shot.

1329
01:59:02,169 --> 01:59:04,933
I don't have a gun. I am not armed.

1330
01:59:06,673 --> 01:59:08,107
Pick up that rifle.

1331
01:59:10,178 --> 01:59:11,338
Pick it up.

1332
01:59:13,614 --> 01:59:14,775
Shells too.

1333
01:59:27,963 --> 01:59:29,453
You killed Little Bill.

1334
01:59:30,934 --> 01:59:32,492
You ain't armed?

1335
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:36,861
I'm not. I don't have a gun.

1336
01:59:37,039 --> 01:59:39,805
I've never had a gun. I'm a writer!

1337
01:59:41,212 --> 01:59:42,473
A writer?

1338
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,711
- Letters and such?
- Books.

1339
01:59:46,317 --> 01:59:47,477
Books.

1340
01:59:48,052 --> 01:59:52,044
I don't believe it, you killed
five men. Single-handed.

1341
02:00:00,565 --> 02:00:02,829
That's a Spencer rifle, right?

1342
02:00:11,677 --> 02:00:13,167
Who'd you kill first?

1343
02:00:17,016 --> 02:00:19,348
"When confronted by superior numbers...

1344
02:00:19,519 --> 02:00:22,750
...an experienced gunfighter will
fire on the best shot first."

1345
02:00:23,757 --> 02:00:26,749
Little Bill said that.
You probably killed him first.

1346
02:00:28,262 --> 02:00:30,354
I was lucky in the order.

1347
02:00:31,264 --> 02:00:34,200
I'm always lucky when it
comes to killing folks.

1348
02:00:37,872 --> 02:00:40,033
Who was next? Clyde, right?

1349
02:00:40,208 --> 02:00:42,938
You killed Clyde, or
was it Deputy Andy...

1350
02:00:43,211 --> 02:00:45,771
All I can tell you is who'll be last.

1351
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,311
I don't deserve this...

1352
02:01:26,424 --> 02:01:28,085
...to die like this.

1353
02:01:31,095 --> 02:01:32,927
I was building a house.

1354
02:01:33,832 --> 02:01:36,494
"Deserve's" got nothing to do with it.

1355
02:01:39,171 --> 02:01:41,504
I'll see you in hell, William Munny.

1356
02:02:21,884 --> 02:02:24,147
All right, I'm coming out!

1357
02:02:24,486 --> 02:02:27,217
Any man I see out there, I'll kill him!

1358
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:30,324
Anyone takes a shot at me...

1359
02:02:31,226 --> 02:02:33,990
...I'll not only kill
him, but his wife...

1360
02:02:34,163 --> 02:02:35,995
...and all his friends...

1361
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:38,731
...and burn his damn house down!

1362
02:02:45,842 --> 02:02:47,741
Nobody better shoot!

1363
02:03:03,193 --> 02:03:05,356
Charley, go ahead. Shoot him!

1364
02:03:21,214 --> 02:03:23,273
Hell, no! I ain't no deputy!

1365
02:03:43,904 --> 02:03:46,304
You better bury Ned right!

1366
02:03:47,141 --> 02:03:50,475
You better not cut up nor
otherwise harm no whores!

1367
02:03:54,750 --> 02:03:58,242
Or I'll come back and kill every
one of you sons-of-bitches.
