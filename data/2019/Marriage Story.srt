1
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,171
What I love about Nicole.

2
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,456
She makes people feel comfortable
about even embarrassing things.

3
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,746
- You look like you care about animals.
- Yes, I do.

4
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,713
She really listens
when someone is talking.

5
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,331
Do you wanna sign up here?

6
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,576
You know what?

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,666
It's funny, I actually signed up for this
but I never heard from you guys.

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,130
Sometimes she listens too much
for too long.

9
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,668
Okay, if you email me here...

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,130
- Thank you so much. Have a good day.
- Good luck.

11
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,288
She's a good citizen.

12
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,166
- Just call him.
- I'm not calling.

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,000
She always knows the right thing to do
when it comes to difficult family shit.

14
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:54,963
Call him.

15
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:02,076
I get stuck in my ways
and she knows when to push me

16
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,326
and when to leave me alone.

17
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,751
She cuts all our hair.

18
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,245
Yeah!

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,670
She's always inexplicably
brewing a cup of tea

20
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,880
that she doesn't drink.

21
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,498
And it's not easy for her
to put away a sock or close a cabinet

22
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,883
or do a dish, but she tries for me.

23
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,460
Nicole grew up in LA around actors

24
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,831
and directors and movies and TV,

25
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,416
and is very close to her mother, Sandra,

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,920
and Cassie, her sister.

27
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,705
Note the wrapping.

28
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,500
Nicole gives great presents.

29
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,918
She is a mother who plays, really plays.

30
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,788
She never steps off playing

31
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,035
or says it's too much.

32
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:15,996
Mom.

33
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,503
And it must be too much some of the time.

34
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,126
"Chopped down a Christmas tree..."

35
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:23,538
All right.

36
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,213
Nice. Two, three, four.

37
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,131
What?

38
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,248
Are you kidding me? I was just in jail!

39
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,753
Goddamn it!

40
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,293
Do not laugh at me. Stop it.

41
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,575
She's competitive.

42
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:38,171
She's amazing at opening jars
because of her strong arms,

43
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,880
which I've always found very sexy.

44
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,503
She keeps the fridge over-full.

45
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,383
No one is ever hungry in our house.

46
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,785
She can drive a stick.

47
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,170
How could you?

48
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,250
After that movie, All Over the Girl,

49
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,883
she could have stayed in LA
and been a movie star,

50
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,828
but she gave that up to do theater
with me in New York.

51
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,420
You might as well get what you paid for.

52
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,041
She's brave.

53
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,668
She's a great dancer.

54
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,880
Infectious.

55
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,248
She makes me wish I could dance.

56
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,921
She always says
when she doesn't know something

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,960
or hasn't read a book
or seen a film or a play,

58
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,251
whereas I fake it or say something
like, "I haven't seen that in awhile."

59
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:26,075
My crazy ideas are her favorite things
to figure out how to execute.

60
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:32,915
Let's try it...

61
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,075
crawling...

62
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,245
but also standing.

63
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,708
She's my favorite actress.

64
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,575
What I love about Charlie.

65
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,080
Charlie is undaunted.

66
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,915
He never lets other people's opinions
or any setbacks

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,460
keep him from what he wants to do.

68
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,416
Charlie eats like he's trying
to get it over with

69
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,000
and like there won't be enough food
for everyone.

70
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,833
A sandwich is to be strangled
while devoured.

71
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,630
Is your shirt on backwards?

72
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,630
But he's incredibly neat,

73
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,038
and I rely on him
to keep things in order.

74
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,171
So...

75
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,881
He's energy-conscious.

76
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,173
Hey.

77
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,173
Sorry.

78
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,826
He doesn't look in the mirror too often.

79
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,576
I cried four times.

80
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,496
Me too.

81
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,003
He cries easily in movies.

82
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,883
I wonder if it was the same four.

83
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,626
He's very self-sufficient.

84
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,328
He can darn a sock
and cook himself dinner and iron a shirt.

85
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,625
How are we doing over here?

86
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,326
The peppers are cut.

87
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,416
He rarely gets defeated, which...

88
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,376
I feel like I always do.

89
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,748
Cut some carrots.

90
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,746
Charlie takes all of my moods steadily.

91
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,503
He doesn't give in to them
or make me feel bad about them.

92
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,538
He's a great dresser.

93
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,040
He never looks embarrassing,
which is hard for a man.

94
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,668
Goddamn it, Charlie, get it together!

95
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,210
He's very competitive.

96
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,381
Oh, come on!

97
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,543
- What's this? Who owns Baltic Avenue?
- Me.

98
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,205
How much is it? I don't have enough.

99
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,631
Four hundred and fifty dollars.

100
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,328
Okay, so I'm done?
I'm done, right? That's it?

101
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,793
This is so frustrating!

102
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,455
This is so frustrating.
I always lose at this game.

103
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,535
- Dad?
- He loves being a dad.

104
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,785
He loves all the things you're supposed
to hate, like the tantrums,

105
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,165
the waking up at night.

106
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,291
I had a bad dream.

107
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,210
It's okay.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,170
It's almost annoying how much he likes it,

109
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,170
but then it's mostly nice.

110
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,960
Dad, stay.

111
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,036
He disappears into his own world.

112
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,671
Shit.

113
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,040
- What's shit?
- This is our stop.

114
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,916
He and Henry are alike in that way.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,080
He can tell people
when they have food in their teeth

116
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,916
or on their face in a way
that doesn't make them feel bad.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Did you get it? Perfect.

118
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,168
Charlie is self-made.

119
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,710
His parents...

120
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,915
I only met them once, but...

121
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:42,418
he told me there was a lot of alcohol
and some violence in his childhood.

122
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,293
As soon as she comes with a lookout,
they come in on the camcorder.

123
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,915
- Camcorder.
- Is that what they're called now?

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,920
He moved to New York from Indiana
with no safety net.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,630
And now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

126
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,208
Made sure they used the right almond milk.

127
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,131
Genius.

128
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,248
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

129
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,415
With the theater company, he cast a spell
that made everyone feel included.

130
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,331
No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant.

131
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,746
He could remember all the inside jokes.

132
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,173
Where do you go when it's windy?

133
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,631
Oh, yeah, that... that was funny.

134
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,575
He's extremely organized and thorough.

135
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,626
He's very clear about what he wants,

136
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,958
unlike me, who can't always tell.

137
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,745
Let's stop right there.

138
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Who wants to start?

139
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,791
I'm not gonna read this out loud.

140
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,328
Why is that?

141
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,538
Because I don't like what I wrote.

142
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,290
As we mediate your separation

143
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,788
and eventual divorce...

144
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,456
things can get quite contentious.

145
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,791
So I like to begin
with a note of positivity

146
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,208
for the people I work with to remember

147
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,418
why they got married in the first place.

148
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,460
And so that, as you come apart,

149
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,251
you're reminded that...

150
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,955
this is a person
you had great feeling for,

151
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,128
and maybe still do in many ways.

152
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,671
I'll read mine. I like what I wrote.

153
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,456
For it to really work,

154
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,286
you both have to read.

155
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,575
I'm not going to.

156
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,630
Okay, um...

157
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:55,038
I just think it's a shame
that you guys aren't gonna get to hear

158
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,575
the wonderful things
you wrote about each other.

159
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,246
She always says I can't write,
but I think mine's pretty good.

160
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,293
Nicole, maybe you'd change your mind
once you heard Charlie's.

161
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,785
I don't wanna hear Charlie's.

162
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,125
We promised to listen.

163
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,038
That's right.

164
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,581
That's the very first step
in this process.

165
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,423
Well, I think I'm gonna go
if you two are gonna just sit around

166
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,540
and suck each other's dicks.

167
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,288
How can this evil allow moderation?

168
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,535
How can this evil allow moderation?

169
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,293
How can it be right
to betray the departed?

170
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,751
How is it human to be so...

171
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,666
faithless?

172
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,916
I want no praise from impious men.

173
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,878
No home with them of quiet ease.

174
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,038
Noble blood still runs in my veins.

175
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,918
Shall I fail my father...

176
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,206
stifling my cries,

177
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,416
clipping the wings of grief?

178
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,786
Must his corpse in the ground

179
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,375
wretchedly waste away,
feebly count for nothing?

180
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,288
Must his killers gloat,

181
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,251
- never to pay with blood for blood?
- Must his killers gloat,

182
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,383
never to pay with blood for blood?

183
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,248
Charlie gave me the note,
but it's really for you.

184
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,960
- He told me to pick up my cues.
- How is that for me?

185
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,751
Acting is reacting.

186
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,383
- I'm responding to you.
- I got intimate.

187
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,168
- And you're slowing me down.
- Frank, it's closing night, you know.

188
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,878
You don't think Charlie and Nicole
will ever get back together?

189
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,538
No, I think this time it's really over.

190
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,245
It still feels weird.

191
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,633
I feel like my parents are splitting up.

192
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,496
It's always been Charlie and Nicole.

193
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,043
- Is Charlie still giving notes?
- Yep.

194
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,665
You're lucky. I wish I was going to LA.

195
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,040
You can actually have space in LA.
There's no space here.

196
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,455
But there's no winter.

197
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,583
Ladies and gentlemen,

198
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,500
I wanna make a toast

199
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,128
to Charlie

200
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,575
and to our beloved Nicole,

201
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:51,826
who is going to be going out
on a new adventure

202
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,876
all the way to sunny California.

203
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,790
And we are also going to try
something new.

204
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,915
We are going to take our play
to Broadway.

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,920
Yeah!

206
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,631
It reminds me of when I was a young person

207
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,998
and went to Broadway for the first time.

208
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,083
And I'm telling you,

209
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,921
winning your first Tony at 27,

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,130
it can mess with your head.

211
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,918
I mean, I was just a baby.

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,460
- Elia Kazan was backstage...
- I'm gonna go over there now.

213
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,881
- Don't do it. Mary Ann?
- elbowing Mike Nichols.

214
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,828
And Mike was jabbing with Dietrich,

215
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,326
and Marlene, you know,

216
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,916
she usually was a barrel of monkeys,

217
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,580
but tonight she was very,
very serious. And of course...

218
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,416
- Could you give me a second?
- later I realized, "My, but that..."

219
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,245
Well, I'd have to study it,
but I'd say you got...

220
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,963
- Hi.
- Oh.

221
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,665
Hey, I didn't expect you guys home
until late.

222
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,381
- How's he doing?
- Good. He went to bed on time.

223
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,208
No fuss. Read him some
of Cricket in Time Square.

224
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,420
God, you guys are so attractive.

225
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,706
Shit. Sorry, I didn't stop that
from being said.

226
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,745
No, it's okay.

227
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,581
I'll pay for the whole time.
We decided to come home early.

228
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,456
Hey, thanks. And also...

229
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,245
conversation as well as anybody,
but I've gotta run.

230
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,040
Hasta pronto, if you know what I mean.

231
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,825
- You're leaving?
- Well, I ain't movin' in.

232
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,456
Oh, we'll be back when you get your...

233
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,630
If you don't like that mediator,
we'll find another one.

234
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,880
- Yeah.
- We might not need a mediator.

235
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,748
We'll split everything anyway,
I don't care.

236
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,753
- Me neither.
- You can have most of it.

237
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,001
We'll get apartments near each other,
make it easier for Henry.

238
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,463
We'll figure it out.
We want the same things.

239
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,126
- Right.
- Meantime, the pilot will be fun for you.

240
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,876
You don't think it's bad, do you?

241
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,128
I don't ever watch TV,

242
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,248
so, you know, I can't tell.

243
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,793
I told Henry I'd come out to LA
in two weeks to see him.

244
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,288
Yes?

245
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,286
Nothing.

246
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,328
I can tell you wanna give me a note.

247
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,286
No, I don't.

248
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,290
Yeah, I mean... yes, I do, but I guess...

249
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,293
I guess it doesn't matter now.

250
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,955
You won't be with the show anymore.
It's stupid.

251
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,381
You're not gonna be able to sleep
until you tell me.

252
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,748
Maybe not.

253
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:05,916
Okay, then.

254
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,876
So there are two things.

255
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,246
I thought your posture at the top
of scene seven is still too dignified.

256
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,423
Okay.

257
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
And then...

258
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,630
at the end, I could tell
you were pushing for the emotion.

259
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,793
Well, you know I can't cry on stage

260
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,165
and I know you don't like it
when I fake it, but...

261
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,710
I thought maybe tonight
it would come, but...

262
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:29,876
it didn't.

263
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,125
That's all I had.

264
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,708
Thanks for indulging me.

265
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:41,876
Good night, Charlie.

266
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:21,325
This is the day, this is the day
That the Lord has made

267
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,496
That the Lord has made

268
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,463
Let us rejoice

269
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,173
Let us rejoice and be glad in it

270
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,750
And be glad in it

271
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:31,785
Mom.

272
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,495
G-ma, summer is for relaxing.

273
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,753
This is the day...

274
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,043
What do you wanna do today?

275
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,708
Hang out and relax with you.

276
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,881
- Me too.
- No relaxing.

277
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,665
Nicole has a hair and makeup test today,

278
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,000
and Henry, we got you into Fairy Camp
with the cousins.

279
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,043
I hate Fairy Camp.

280
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,375
Cassie says everyone likes Fairy Camp,

281
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,168
and I think this is true.

282
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,245
Henry, go make your mom some coffee
like I taught you.

283
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,881
Mom, wait till you taste my coffee.

284
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,380
Oop-a-doodle.

285
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,793
Do you always sleep together?

286
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,075
Even in New York?

287
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,206
No, it's just for right now
while we go through this transition.

288
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,961
Oh, shit.

289
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,001
Don't tell Charlie when he gets here.
He hates co-sleeping.

290
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,673
Well, I have to say, I agree with Charlie.

291
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,670
Oh, surprise surprise.

292
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,168
- It's as if you have exploded...
- Jesus, it's early.

293
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,038
Into this room.

294
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,456
I can do this part alone.

295
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,001
Fine. I won't look.

296
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,748
As long as you're in my house,
wake up is at 6:30 a.m.,

297
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,633
and until you know what you wanna do,

298
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,498
we're gonna do what I like to do.

299
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,463
I can't just go from what Charlie
wanted to do to what you want to do.

300
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,168
Even though I am 64

301
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,000
and have a dead gay husband,

302
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,883
I manage to get up every day,

303
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,578
live my life, and feel pretty good
about myself.

304
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,790
So maybe your mom knows a thing or two.

305
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,633
You know what I would do?

306
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,208
About what?

307
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,541
When Charlie gets here,

308
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,745
I'd whisk him off to Palm Springs.

309
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,833
That's what your father and I did
whenever we hit a speed bump.

310
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,383
Didn't you walk in on Dad
blowing the porter in Palm Springs?

311
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:21,248
And I always regretted
getting so upset about it.

312
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:25,213
Charlie and I are getting a divorce, Mom.
There's nothing for us in Palm Springs.

313
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,791
You need to wash your face
before you go to sleep.

314
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,206
When Daddy gets here,
maybe we could all go on the Jaws ride.

315
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,131
Yeah.

316
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,328
Or I could go once with Daddy
and once with you

317
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,246
because I wouldn't mind
going twice anyway.

318
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,583
We'll all go together, sweetheart.

319
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,496
Did you know that Universal Studios

320
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,543
is where I did my first screen test?

321
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,625
On the plane, I re-read the pilot
as if I were Charlie reading it

322
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,458
and I started to think it was just bad.

323
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,168
My agent says it's one to watch.

324
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,333
This coffee is good. Thank you.

325
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,286
You're welcome.

326
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,665
What if Charlie is on Broadway

327
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,880
with a play I brought him,
which I originated,

328
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,418
and I'm just doing bad TV?

329
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,540
Everyone is only impressed
when they see someone on TV.

330
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,325
She's beautiful.

331
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,786
- Her wig looks great.
- Where's she been for the past ten years?

332
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,625
Doing weird theater in New York,
downtown shit.

333
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,828
- I saw one. It rained onstage.
- Can I say something?

334
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,376
It was good. It was edgy.

335
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,328
Directed by her husband.
Supposedly very controlling.

336
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,786
- We're lucky to have her.
- I'm surprised she said yes.

337
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,125
We can thank her divorce.

338
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,418
Can she move her hand?

339
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,250
It'll be hard to roto in the hair
on the baby around her fingers.

340
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,043
Can you move your hand
further down the baby?

341
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,080
Where? Like here?

342
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,286
Off the head entirely.

343
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,538
I have to support his head.

344
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,625
No, support the head, of course.
Just try and do it from the shoulders.

345
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,830
- It's perfect.
- Yes, good.

346
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,286
- I can't hold a baby like this.
- She's right, that's gonna look weird.

347
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,375
We can totally do it.
It'll just take time and money.

348
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,288
It's very important
to have this show based on hard science.

349
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,375
So we can see your pretty face
and not ours.

350
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,628
You should've seen me
before the plants invaded.

351
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,958
I say that with respect.

352
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,421
I was raised by two mothers.

353
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,880
Can you lower the board please, Pablo?

354
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,166
Here? How about here?

355
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,463
- How about now?
- Why is there always a flirty grip?

356
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,751
I can do anything you want.
I need her here two hours before...

357
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:11,713
Can I say something?

358
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,670
Hold on. What, honey?

359
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,956
She has to know how to hold a baby.

360
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,711
Later on, after she kills Donny...

361
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,131
- She kills Donny?
- That's a secret.

362
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,168
She becomes a sort of a Earth mother...

363
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,420
to the plant community.

364
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:26,543
That's not gonna make any sense if we feel
like she's a bad mother to her own kid.

365
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,205
- She's right.
- Does Donny know?

366
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,791
- Must be nice to get out of New York.
- Well, I'm from out here.

367
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,375
Our daughter, Mia, is at NYU,
living in a shoebox.

368
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,418
She says it went up to 104 the other day.

369
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,830
- We are just so excited to have you.
- I'm excited to be here.

370
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,536
We're going for an early aughts aesthetic,
so having your presence just nails that.

371
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,825
What signifies early aughts?

372
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,286
- Into the Girl was on TV...
- All Over the Girl.

373
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,575
Or streaming or something.

374
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,536
You are fucking hot in that movie.

375
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,285
- Carol.
- Fuck it, I speak my mind.

376
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,915
- We're not allowing our son to see it.
- Because you show your tits.

377
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,380
- Carol!
- Dennis.

378
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:59,168
This is Carter Mitchum.
He's a futurist at UCLA.

379
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,710
He's consulting on all the environmental
stuff for the show so it's accurate.

380
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,331
- Nice to meet you.
- Is it?

381
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,376
- What?
- Accurate?

382
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,418
So far, none of it.

383
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,420
This pilot will go.
So just get ready to move back to LA.

384
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Everything you were saying back there
was absolutely right.

385
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,633
- If she's a bad mom, we lose the audience.
- Nobody knows we're killing Donny,

386
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,708
including Donny.

387
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:17,631
I thought...

388
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,288
Let us know if you'd like to be part
of our writer's room.

389
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,495
I bet you'd be really helpful, actually.

390
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,043
Or I could direct.

391
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,455
- No, yeah.
- Sorry, what? Maybe that sounds crazy.

392
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,711
No, do you have a reel?

393
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,133
No, because I've never done it.
I watched my husband do it for years.

394
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,168
Almost ex-husband.

395
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,290
Oh, what's the opposite of fiancé?

396
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,126
Dennis and I'll talk
to your agent about it.

397
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,998
At our theater I always wanted to direct,
and then Charlie would say something

398
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,423
like, "The next one,"
but he was always the director,

399
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,960
so there never was a next one.

400
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,825
I don't know. Maybe if we'd stayed married
there would've been.

401
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,326
We're gonna kill him off.
It seems unlikely...

402
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,916
I'm gonna give you a number.

403
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,041
Okay, is it a therapist?
'Cause I have a therapist.

404
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,705
Well, it's my mom's therapist.
We share her.

405
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,541
She's a lawyer. She represented me
when I left Dennis.

406
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,670
Oh. You and Dennis are divorced?

407
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:09,791
Since 2013.

408
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,075
You still work together.

409
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,578
That's nice.

410
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,036
Oh, no, he's a fucking cocksucker.

411
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,205
Nora got me half of this project
in the settlement.

412
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:17,671
Oh.

413
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,920
Well, we talked about doing it
without lawyers.

414
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,383
My sister had me meet
a bunch of them already

415
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,958
and I just hated them.

416
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,455
Call Nora.

417
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,581
She saved my life.

418
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,330
Sorry, I...

419
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,786
look so schleppy.

420
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,325
I had an event at my kid's school.

421
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,831
Let me get this out of the way.

422
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,206
I think you're a wonderful actress.

423
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:40,788
Thank you.

424
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,705
I loved All Over the Girl,

425
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,131
but the theater stuff too...

426
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,418
You saw the theater stuff?

427
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,000
I was in New York last year for my book,

428
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,713
which, remind me to give you a copy,

429
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,711
and my publisher took me.

430
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:53,631
Great.

431
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,040
- Thank you.
- You're awesome.

432
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,710
- Well, Charlie directed it.
- I know.

433
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,501
He's very talented.

434
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,673
He is.

435
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,210
They're moving it to Broadway.

436
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,333
Well, without me, of course.

437
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,170
He was lucky to have you.

438
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:13,923
How are you doing?

439
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,628
- Oh.
- Sorry.

440
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,080
Honey...

441
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:36,875
You take some breaths.

442
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,133
And while you do,
I'm gonna tell you about myself.

443
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,211
If you should choose to hire me,

444
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,331
I will work tirelessly for you,

445
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,956
and I'm always available by phone or text,

446
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,713
except when I'm with my kids.

447
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,631
I insist on doing drop off and pick up
every day at school.

448
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,708
- I understand.
- I've been through this myself.

449
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,576
Thank you, Annie. So...

450
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,920
I know how it feels.

451
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,830
- You do?
- Yes.

452
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:06,576
I have a kid from my ex,
and he's a narcissistic artist...

453
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,921
and verbally abusive.

454
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,916
I'm now with a great boyfriend
who lives in Malibu.

455
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:13,496
Good.

456
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,253
Well, Charlie's not terrible.

457
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,673
No, of course not.

458
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,786
But they ravish you with attention
in the beginning,

459
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,166
and then once we have babies,
we become the mom

460
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,210
and they get sick of us.

461
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,043
Where do you wanna live now, doll?

462
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,830
Well...

463
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,415
I'm here now, obviously.

464
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,501
I don't know
if the show'll get picked up, but...

465
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,041
feels like home.

466
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,375
It is home.

467
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,375
It's the only home I've ever known
without Charlie.

468
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,326
You wanna stay here?

469
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,956
Charlie's not gonna want that. He...

470
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,288
He hates LA.

471
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,495
We're interested in what you wanna do.

472
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,333
Sounds to me
like you did your time in New York.

473
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,458
He can do some time here, no?

474
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,251
He always said we would, but he never...

475
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,288
did.

476
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,043
How old is your son?

477
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,575
Henry's eight.

478
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,125
He likes LA.

479
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,666
I don't know if it's fair to him.

480
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,793
I want you to listen to me.

481
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,286
What you're doing is an act of hope.

482
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,495
Do you understand that?

483
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:29,881
Yeah.

484
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:34,133
You're saying,
"I want something better for myself."

485
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:35,916
I do.

486
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,205
And this, right now, is the worst time.

487
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,666
It will only get better.

488
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:47,078
Wasn't it Tom Petty who said
"The waiting is the hardest part"?

489
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,036
Oh.

490
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,328
I don't know.

491
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,250
I represented his wife
in their divorce.

492
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,286
I got her half of that song.

493
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,080
Oh, I don't want any money or anything.

494
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,786
I just worried 'cause we weren't
gonna use lawyers, so...

495
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,628
I don't wanna be too aggressive.

496
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,631
I wanna stay friends.

497
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,383
We'll do it as gently as possible.

498
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:12,496
Now...

499
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,080
can you tell me a little more
about what's going on?

500
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:22,463
Because part of what we're gonna
do together is tell your story.

501
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,580
It's difficult to articulate.

502
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:27,706
It's...

503
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:30,171
not as simple
as not being in love anymore.

504
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,830
I understand.

505
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:36,003
Why don't you start at the beginning?
Wherever that is for you.

506
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,498
Well...

507
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:42,633
I was engaged to Ben

508
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,498
and living in LA, you know?

509
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:49,328
And I felt like yes, I wanted
to make movies and marry Ben.

510
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,423
Oh, Jesus,
I was only 19 or 20 at the time.

511
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,210
I never felt older in my whole life.

512
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,916
Anyway, if I was honest with myself,

513
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,170
it was like a small part of me
felt dead...

514
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,080
or dead-ish.

515
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,381
You know, you tell yourself,

516
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,328
"No one's perfect,
no relationship's perfect."

517
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,963
Oh, this tea is delicious.

518
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,831
Isn't it? It's the Manuka honey.

519
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,876
Anyway, you were asking about Charlie.

520
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,666
So, um...

521
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,126
So, yes. So I was...

522
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,325
happy with Ben and aware of the deadness,

523
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,996
and I went to New York

524
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,075
to meet with this director
for this space movie.

525
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,458
But one where they take space seriously,

526
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:32,131
like sex trafficking in space.

527
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,633
You know, it was political.

528
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:36,331
Or at least they wanted us
to think it was. Anyway.

529
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:37,418
It just...

530
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:41,131
it was really fulfilling the same need
that certain fucked up porn does.

531
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,081
But anyway, so...

532
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:44,875
while I was there...

533
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:46,921
the producer...

534
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:48,876
invited me to see a play.

535
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,580
It took place in someone's apartment
with all the lights on.

536
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:56,131
It was like nothing I'd ever seen before.

537
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:58,168
This strange...

538
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,421
surreal, dystopian story,

539
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:03,326
and it was so well-acted.

540
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:07,376
And one of the actors
was this big shaggy bear

541
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:10,248
who played all his lines
looking directly at me,

542
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:13,633
which I knew couldn't be the case,
but it felt like it.

543
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,173
And then later,
of course, I learned that it was.

544
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:22,166
- These cookies are really great too.
- I'll send you home with some.

545
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,500
Afterwards, I was introduced to the cast,

546
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:28,133
and the bear turned out
to also be the director.

547
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,455
He talked to me and...

548
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:34,248
I talked back.

549
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,711
The dead part wasn't dead,
it was just in a coma.

550
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,288
And...

551
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:43,325
it was better than the sex, the talking.

552
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:44,753
Although the...

553
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,293
the sex was also like the talking.

554
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,745
You know, everything's like everything
in a relationship.

555
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:50,793
Don't you find that?

556
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:52,538
And...

557
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,290
So we spent...

558
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,578
the whole night
and the next day together and...

559
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,628
I just never left.

560
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:04,825
Yes, to be honest, all the problems
were there in the beginning too.

561
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:08,711
But I just went along with him
and his life because it felt so damn good

562
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,081
to feel myself alive.

563
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:14,828
In the beginning,
I was the actress, the star and...

564
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:18,825
that felt like something, you know,
people came to see me at first, but...

565
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,333
the farther away I got from that and...

566
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:26,245
the more acclaim the theater company got,
and I had less and less weight.

567
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,633
I just became...

568
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:29,288
"Who?

569
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,165
Well, you know, the actress
that was in that thing that time."

570
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:33,875
And he was the draw.

571
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,130
And that...

572
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:38,878
would've been fine, but...

573
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:41,876
I got smaller.

574
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,955
I realized I...

575
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:55,133
I didn't ever come alive for myself.
I was just feeding his aliveness.

576
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,131
And...

577
00:28:58,583 --> 00:28:59,673
you know...

578
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,995
he was so smart and creative, it...

579
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:03,665
it was fine.

580
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:07,666
You know, I would tell him things
at home in private

581
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,830
and they would work their way into public
conversation into his work, and...

582
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,460
for a while, that felt like enough,
I mean, I was just so...

583
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:17,921
so flattered that someone like him

584
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,670
would find an idea I had worth trying

585
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,210
or a comment I made worth repeating and...

586
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:24,918
and then I got pregnant.

587
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:28,998
And I thought that having a baby
could be ours, could really be ours,

588
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,543
but also really mine.

589
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,668
And, you know, he was so excited.

590
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,460
So it was nice.

591
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,133
For a while.

592
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,130
I mean, kids, they...

593
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,673
they belong to themselves, it's like...

594
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,381
the instant
they leave your body, it's just...

595
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,626
the process of them going away...

596
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,378
And I didn't belong to myself.

597
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:54,003
And it was small stuff,
stupid stuff, and big stuff.

598
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,213
All the furniture in our house,

599
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:57,671
that was his taste.

600
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,831
I didn't even know
what my taste was anymore

601
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:02,166
because I'd never been asked to use it.

602
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:05,421
I didn't even pick our apartment.
I just moved into his.

603
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,920
And I made noises
about wanting to move back to LA,

604
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,750
but they came to nothing.

605
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,333
And we'd come here on holidays
because he liked my family.

606
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:15,076
But if I suggested
we do a year or something,

607
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,035
he'd just put me off.

608
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,576
It would be...

609
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:22,246
strange if he turned to me and said,

610
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,581
"And what do you wanna do today?"

611
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:29,205
You know, I just watched that documentary
on George Harrison,

612
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,786
and I thought, "Own it."

613
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,130
Just own it.
Be like George Harrison's wife.

614
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,291
"Being a wife and a mother, that's enough."

615
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,881
Yeah, then I realized I couldn't
remember her name, so...

616
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:43,206
This pilot came along.

617
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:47,211
It shot in LA and it paid so much,

618
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:50,583
and it was like there was
this little lifeline thrown to me.

619
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:53,785
Here's this bit of earth
that's yours, and...

620
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:58,003
I was embarrassed about it
in front of him, but it was also like...

621
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,286
yeah, this is who I am

622
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,078
and this is what I'm worth.

623
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,746
And maybe it's stupid,

624
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,213
but at least it's mine.

625
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:11,291
And if he had just taken me
into a big hug and said,

626
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:14,076
"Baby, I'm so excited for your adventure.

627
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,786
Of course I want you to have
a piece of earth that's yours,"

628
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:18,463
then...

629
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,628
well, then,
we might not be getting divorced.

630
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:21,955
But...

631
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
he made fun of it and...

632
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,710
was jealous like he is, and...

633
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,746
then he realized about the money.

634
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:34,285
And he told me I could funnel it
back into the theater company.

635
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:38,166
And that's when I realized...

636
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:40,131
he...

637
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:42,825
truly didn't see me.

638
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,668
He didn't see me as something
separate from himself.

639
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,003
And I asked him to say my phone number.

640
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,293
He didn't know it.

641
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,040
So I left.

642
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:03,578
Also, I think he slept
with the stage manager, Mary Ann.

643
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,041
That fucking asshole.

644
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,825
Seventy-five... just 70,

645
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:11,036
those two zeroes,

646
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,785
- seventy-five point zero zero...
- "If railroad is unowned..."

647
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:16,075
- that's zero cents.
- "...you may buy it from the bank."

648
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,956
"Advance to Illios...

649
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,171
- Illinois.
- "...Illinois Avenue."

650
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,670
"Advance," what does that mean?

651
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,921
It means you've gotta go
to Illinois Avenue.

652
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:28,211
So where is Illinois Avenue?

653
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,421
That one.

654
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,920
So, Cassie, when Charlie gets here,
you're gonna hand him the envelope.

655
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,670
Why do I have to do it?

656
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,000
Because Nicole is very good

657
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,333
at getting people to do things for her.

658
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,746
- That's not what this is.
- I wiped her butt till she was nine.

659
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,793
- She's very seductive that way.
- No.

660
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,665
Mom, legally,
I can't be the one who serves him.

661
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,960
But still, what I'm saying is true.

662
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:51,961
Do I have to actually hand him
the envelope?

663
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,671
Yes, but I'm gonna tell him in advance
that they're divorce papers.

664
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,880
Nora says it doesn't
have to be so formal. Where is Henry?

665
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:01,038
He's playing in the living room
with Sam, Jules, and Molly.

666
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,285
Let's get them upstairs.

667
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,375
- Charlie's gonna be here soon.
- Sam, go upstairs.

668
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:06,708
So I'll tell Charlie what's happening,

669
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,711
and, Cassie,
you then hand him the envelope.

670
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:10,631
Okay...

671
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:12,171
I just get nervous.

672
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,460
Well, can you un-serve?

673
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:17,076
- What do you mean? Like take it back?
- Yeah.

674
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:19,923
- I think so.
- You should check.

675
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,500
In case we change our minds...

676
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,713
I'm not gonna change my mind.

677
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,461
- Or we feel too bad for him.
- Maybe in case I do something wrong.

678
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:27,461
Now you're both just
making me feel bad, okay?

679
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:28,961
I'm sorry, I'm nervous!

680
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,881
Well, we all are.

681
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:32,668
And we love Charlie.

682
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,750
You have to stop loving him, Mom.

683
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,543
You can't be friends with him anymore.

684
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:39,375
Charlie and I have our own relationship,

685
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:41,538
independent of your marriage.

686
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:45,035
Just like I'm still friends
with Cassie's ex, Jeff.

687
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,495
Are you still seeing Jeff?

688
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,705
An occasional lunch.

689
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:50,041
I can't believe you!

690
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:51,995
And he still wants his camera back,
by the way.

691
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:55,423
Listen, nothing can be independent
of our marriage right now.

692
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,500
I can't believe I even have to explain
this to you. Just be on my side, okay?

693
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:01,423
- Okay.
- And stop seeing Jeff!

694
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:05,961
Cassie, you're the server.

695
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,671
Just let me practice a few times.

696
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,380
I was never a good auditioner.

697
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:13,288
- That's because you wanted it too bad.
- It's not an audition.

698
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:14,955
I'll play Charlie.

699
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:17,211
It's just my palms are so perspired.

700
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,631
Sweetie, you're blotting the envelope.

701
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,668
Maybe Nicole should play you.

702
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,960
Did you really just say that?

703
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,331
We don't need to practice.
This is not a performance.

704
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:26,825
Did we finish the other wine already?

705
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:27,746
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

706
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:29,541
Oh!

707
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,330
Okay, let me get him.
You both go in the other room.

708
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:35,246
Cassie, you make sure that Henry
goes upstairs with Molly and Jules.

709
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,423
Happening now.

710
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,878
- Mom!
- I'm getting my wine.

711
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,080
What?

712
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,746
Henry's pooping
in the bathroom downstairs.

713
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,293
Can we transfer him to the one upstairs?

714
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,745
- I think it's mid-poop.
- Just grab him when he comes out.

715
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,133
- Cassie?
- What?

716
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:52,458
I'm putting the envelope
over here by the toaster.

717
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:53,631
Copy you.

718
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:00,998
- Hi.
- Hi.

719
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,213
Where's Henry?

720
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:03,171
He's pooping.

721
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,133
Hi, Henry!

722
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:07,633
Does this couch still open?

723
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:08,828
Yeah.

724
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:12,706
I got off the plane to a text, but don't
tell anyone yet. It's still a secret.

725
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:13,751
Okay.

726
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:17,996
I won a MacArthur grant.

727
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:21,708
Charlie! Oh, my God, that's great!

728
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:23,041
Congratulations.

729
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:26,165
I'll say it 'cause you can't,
it's the Genius Grant. You're a genius.

730
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,290
Oh, I'm really happy for you.
You deserve it.

731
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:31,035
It's yours too.
We did all of this together.

732
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:34,325
Thank you,
but it's yours, Charlie, you enjoy it.

733
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,205
I'm starving.

734
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:38,881
It's good money
and they parse it out over five years.

735
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:41,128
It means I can keep everyone
in the theater company employed,

736
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,288
- pay my credit card debt.
- So great.

737
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,125
Of course I went instantly to,
"It's all downhill from here.

738
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:47,788
Now my first Broadway play has to fail."

739
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:48,705
No.

740
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:50,631
We just started rehearsals again,
I don't know.

741
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:53,128
You always don't know at this point
and then it gets there.

742
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,918
Do I? 'Cause I don't remember.

743
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,040
I know, it's true, it'll be great.

744
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,665
Okay, I hope you're right.

745
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,673
- Everyone says hi.
- Oh.

746
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,583
Tell them hi. I miss everyone.

747
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,536
You'll see them again when you come back.

748
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,955
Gosh, a MacArthur, Broadway...

749
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,291
it's so exciting.

750
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,500
Congratulations, Charlie.

751
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,330
Which bathroom?

752
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,633
- What?
- Is he pooping?

753
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:26,205
Oh, downstairs.

754
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:27,291
Is your mom home?

755
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,075
Yeah, she's upstairs.

756
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,920
- Hey, how's it going?
- Nothing yet.

757
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,250
- It's me.
- I know.

758
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,253
- I just got here.
- Hi.

759
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:39,036
- I brought you something.
- Yay.

760
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,875
Mom's getting me a present too.

761
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,793
- Why?
- For pooping.

762
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:45,038
Oh.

763
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,578
- I love you.
- I love you.

764
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,665
I don't think we should reward him
for pooping anymore.

765
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,000
I know, but he holds it in
and it's going on a week.

766
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,753
- It's its own reward. G-ma!
- Charlie-bird!

767
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,581
Stop it! Oh, God, I'm huge!

768
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:02,916
- You're as light as a feather.
- Mom?

769
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,173
Why didn't you respond to my last email?

770
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,790
Well, your emails are so articulate.
I get intimidated.

771
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,415
- Mom, can you...
- Now I'll lift you!

772
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:12,705
Mom?

773
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,750
Mom?

774
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,285
- Mom?
- What?

775
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,455
Upstairs.

776
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:19,381
Oh.

777
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,710
I'm gonna write ya back now.

778
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:26,751
Cassie?

779
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:28,458
Hey, Charlie.

780
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:29,791
I like your haircut.

781
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,286
Oh, thanks.

782
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,421
- Mom?
- I'll go.

783
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,918
Henry's calling you, Nicole!

784
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,880
I hear him.

785
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:39,958
What's going on, Henry?

786
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:42,036
Can you ask Mom to come?

787
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,251
He wants you.

788
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,500
What kind of pie is that?

789
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:53,128
It's...

790
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:58,671
pecan.

791
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,751
- Did you make it?
- I don't know.

792
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:03,628
No, it's store-bought.

793
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,500
You know Joan's on Third?

794
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,923
Oh, yeah, it's good, right?

795
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,920
What?

796
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,170
The store, yeah.

797
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,540
Jules and Molly love it.

798
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,915
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

799
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,125
I'm just hot!

800
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:17,883
I'll pour you some water.

801
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:21,166
Nicole says you're doing a play?

802
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,710
I think you'd like it.

803
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:26,291
It's a great unproduced play
by this really interesting British writer.

804
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,665
- So you do an English accent?
- Yeah.

805
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,790
- It's more northern England.
- Oh.

806
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,995
What does that sound like?

807
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,881
You want a cup of tea, do ya?

808
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,036
Right. Good.

809
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,246
Oh, thank you, missus.

810
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:44,713
What is...

811
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:49,208
- What's this?
- Oh, it's a manila envelope, love.

812
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:50,251
Ooh, can I start over?

813
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:51,423
Has my name on it.

814
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:57,286
Oh.

815
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,745
Jesus. Sorry.

816
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,250
You're served.

817
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,125
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

818
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,248
I can't lie.

819
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,923
You're being served.

820
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,710
You guys are getting a di...
I don't know, I'm sorry.

821
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:20,705
I was gonna warn you
so it didn't become a thing. I'm sorry.

822
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,540
Feel like I'm in a dream.

823
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,038
We don't have a marriage anymore.

824
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,745
I know you don't want the disruption,

825
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,383
but you don't wanna be married.

826
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,631
Not really.

827
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,133
But I don't want this.

828
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:53,166
What did you expect was gonna happen?

829
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:59,328
I don't know,
I guess I didn't think it through,

830
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:02,916
but I thought we agreed
we weren't going to use lawyers.

831
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:04,246
I want...

832
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:08,828
I don't know, I'm trying to say this
as undramatically as possible.

833
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,126
I want...

834
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,748
an entirely different kind of life.

835
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:17,206
Let's wait until you finish this pilot
and come back to New York.

836
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,211
Let's figure it out there,
at home, together.

837
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,631
- Nora's known for being very fair.
- We don't need to do it with envelopes.

838
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:22,828
- This is Nora?
- Yeah.

839
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,251
She's great. I feel like
we could be friends with her.

840
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,043
Why do I feel like that won't happen?

841
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,375
It's just a formality.

842
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:30,501
- Why...
- You don't respond right away.

843
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,293
Why did Cassie have a pie?

844
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,875
The pie was hers.
The pie wasn't part of it.

845
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:36,078
Are you sure?

846
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,826
What would the pie have to do
with anything?

847
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,210
I don't know. It somehow makes it worse.

848
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,788
I'm sorry, but the pie was just a pie.

849
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:45,916
So what...

850
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:49,958
what do I do?

851
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,041
You get a lawyer too.

852
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,325
"'Well, I guess I better be going.'"

853
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,210
Stuart rose from the ditch,
climbed into his car...

854
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,293
and started up the road
that led toward the north.

855
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:10,166
The sun was just coming up
over the hills on his right.

856
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:14,536
As he peered ahead into the great land
that stretched before him,

857
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,576
the way seemed long...

858
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,831
but the sky was bright.

859
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:22,376
"And he somehow felt
he was headed in the right direction."

860
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:26,998
I forgot it ended that way.

861
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:31,673
Yeah, wow, Stuart really overreacted,
didn't you think?

862
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,290
He was upset about his boat.

863
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:40,041
Dad, you go away.

864
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,035
Mom, you stay.

865
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:46,461
- Hey, Daddy just got here.
- It's okay.

866
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,710
Love you.

867
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:56,748
You can come back and wake me up
and read to me later, Daddy, okay?

868
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:58,173
Okay.

869
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:03,786
- Will you come sleep in my bed later?
- Yeah.

870
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:14,503
Oh.

871
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,633
Hang in there, Charlie-bird.

872
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:17,668
Thanks, G-ma.

873
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:48,923
He's in a mommy phase right now.

874
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,830
It's okay.

875
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,880
I'm sorry. I drank too much wine.

876
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:04,166
- I can imagine.
- Didn't eat dinner.

877
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,500
Stressful time.

878
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:07,751
I hope Henry didn't notice.

879
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:08,833
I'm sure he didn't.

880
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:10,626
Now that I'm a parent,
I realize my parents

881
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:12,328
were probably drunk all the time with me.

882
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:13,246
Yeah.

883
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,791
I'm sorry again.

884
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:17,166
Thanks.

885
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:19,463
Where are you staying?

886
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,785
Oh, well, I...

887
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,420
hadn't...

888
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:32,956
I guess I'll...

889
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:37,248
There's a new hotel on Highland that's...

890
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,500
supposedly not too expensive
and pretty nice.

891
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,673
Oh, okay, I'll check it out.

892
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,131
Again, that's great about the MacArthur.

893
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:47,746
Thanks.

894
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,880
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

895
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:01,580
Thanks.

896
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,415
- Fuck.
- What?

897
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,130
She's being represented by Nora.

898
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,578
She's supposedly very fair?

899
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,456
All right, here's the fact, Jack.

900
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:20,003
I charge $950 an hour.

901
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,540
Ted is $400.

902
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:24,753
If you have a stupid question,
you call Ted.

903
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:29,246
To start, we'll need a $25,000 retainer.

904
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,333
- That's more than I can...
- And all your financials.

905
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,876
We need to do a forensic accounting.

906
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:36,248
Which runs anywhere from ten to $20,000.

907
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:39,753
But if we can all agree right away,
it shouldn't get too bad,

908
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:42,383
- right?
- You were married here in LA?

909
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:44,578
Yes, because her mom and sister
are out here

910
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:47,376
- and I'm not close with my family.
- Your son was born out here?

911
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:50,958
Yes, because, again, her mom
and sister are out here and I'm not...

912
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:52,421
So you got married here,

913
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,210
your kid was born here...

914
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,125
and she served you here?

915
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,038
Yeah, but we lived in New York.

916
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,830
Why?

917
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:04,955
- There a problem?
- We'll have to reshape the narrative.

918
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:08,581
If you're serious
about having your child in New York,

919
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,535
this is what I suggest.

920
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:13,415
You take your kid...
Did you say his name was Fred?

921
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:15,833
- Henry.
- Henry?

922
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,293
Why did I say Fred?

923
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,875
Well, I have a kid named Fred.

924
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:22,538
You take Henry to New York
with you right now.

925
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,745
Then we file an action in New York.

926
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,745
We make this a New York case.

927
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,833
We need to make an argument
you're a New York-based family.

928
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:29,746
Well, we are.

929
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:32,833
Otherwise, you'll probably never
see your kid outside of LA again.

930
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:34,496
Really? No.

931
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:37,705
It's very hard to convince the courts
to move a kid.

932
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:41,576
As soon as you let your wife
and child leave New York,

933
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:43,996
you made life very difficult for yourself.

934
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:47,883
Yes, but as I said, we're
a New York family, that's just a fact.

935
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,745
She's here temporarily.

936
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,626
Then why do you think
she served you out here?

937
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:56,583
I don't... know,

938
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,415
but Henry wants to
go back to New York.

939
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,290
No, don't quote your kid.

940
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:03,458
He's just telling you
what you wanna hear.

941
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:07,173
And trust me,
he's telling her the opposite.

942
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,750
Let me have the Barbara file!

943
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:17,583
What's...

944
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:21,003
"Exit Goat"?

945
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:24,213
Exit Ghost. It's the name
of my theater company.

946
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,541
You're a director?

947
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:26,705
Theater director, yeah.

948
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,455
Anything I've seen?

949
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:29,881
I don't know. What have you seen?

950
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,540
Our production of Electra
is moving to Broadway...

951
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:36,785
which is exciting.

952
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:39,125
We have to make sure
that money is protected.

953
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:41,628
I mean, it's theater,
so it's not a lot of money.

954
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:44,828
I basically put whatever money I make
back in the theater.

955
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:45,876
I wonder.

956
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:47,748
Do we ask for support?

957
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:49,923
- Interesting.
- From Nicole?

958
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,330
I'm not going to do that.

959
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,495
Does your wife's family have money?

960
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,750
Her mother has some from her TV career.

961
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,253
And her father died.

962
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:03,673
Well, we could say that we don't want
her mother to see the kid,

963
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,381
draw her into the case.

964
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:08,498
In that instance,
her mother could pay your legal fees.

965
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:09,746
No.

966
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,075
I'm very close to her mom.

967
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:15,421
- Nicole's family has been my family...
- Yeah, but that's gonna change.

968
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,210
And I suggest you get used to it.

969
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:19,745
We need to hire a private investigator.

970
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:21,753
Really? I mean...

971
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:25,875
- Really?
- Does your wife do drugs or anything?

972
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:26,788
Coke?

973
00:47:27,416 --> 00:47:28,496
Not in any real way.

974
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:31,208
Well, we're not gonna win
if she's the perfect mother.

975
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,418
She was addicted to Tums for a while.

976
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:38,206
Hey, it wasn't nothing.
She was up to a tube a day.

977
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:40,081
Have you noticed anyone following you?

978
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:40,996
No.

979
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:43,878
Well, keep an eye out.

980
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:46,038
Look, you need to be prepared for the fact

981
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:50,165
that Nora is gonna portray you
as a neglectful, absent father.

982
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:51,745
But I'm not.

983
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:52,883
You live in New York.

984
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,538
You're consumed with your work.

985
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:58,416
She and your kid are out here, struggling.

986
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,705
Nora's gonna use that strategy.

987
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,001
I'm sure of it.

988
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:03,333
But Nicole's not going to lie.

989
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:06,286
Listen, if we start from a place
of reasonable,

990
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,665
and they start from a place of crazy,

991
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,710
when we settle, we'll be somewhere
between reasonable and crazy.

992
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:13,671
Which is still crazy.

993
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,330
Half of crazy is crazy.

994
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:18,376
You know what people say, "Criminal
lawyers see bad people at their best",

995
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:20,708
divorce lawyers see good people
at their worst."

996
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:23,501
Before this is all over,
you're gonna hate me and Ted

997
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:26,213
just because of what we represent
in your life.

998
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,381
I'm sure you're right.

999
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:28,828
So tell me the story again.

1000
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:31,326
- You came out here to see your kid.
- Maybe I'm not explaining this...

1001
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:33,076
- She serves you.
- We're friendly, we're fine...

1002
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:34,666
- What a bitch.
- We're figuring this out.

1003
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,880
She's not a bitch.

1004
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:38,708
Thanks, but this isn't...
We're doing it a different way.

1005
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,673
And I can't even close to afford this.

1006
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:46,126
I gotta get back to New York.
I have a Broadway play and rehearsals.

1007
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:53,746
I was the hot shit at that time.

1008
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:56,383
Young, very sexy,

1009
00:48:56,458 --> 00:48:58,788
with a great head of hair.

1010
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:01,495
I so appreciate that Charlie
gave me this opportunity.

1011
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,043
Or maybe I should thank Nicole.

1012
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:05,705
I heard Nicole's pilot went to series,
so she's moving to LA.

1013
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,421
And they put Henry in school out there.

1014
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,830
Is Charlie moving too?

1015
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:09,996
Not Charlie.

1016
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,173
He won't abandon us.

1017
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,790
And you can't do theater in LA.

1018
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,330
Charlie said she and Henry
are coming back to New York

1019
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:17,076
when she finishes filming her show.

1020
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,536
I wouldn't be so sure.

1021
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,535
Nicole was never gonna stay in New York,
that was obvious.

1022
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,625
She was probably
planning this move all along.

1023
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:25,578
When she sees an opportunity,

1024
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:27,036
believe me, she takes it.

1025
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:30,575
Well, LA is nice. The space.

1026
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:33,996
Four-time Oscar winner, sucking my...

1027
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:36,133
- Okay, how is everyone today?
- Hey!

1028
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:38,458
Nobody get too close.
I think I caught Donna's cold.

1029
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:41,211
- Sorry, Charlie.
- I'm expecting a Skype call from Henry,

1030
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:42,921
so I might have to step out.

1031
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:46,461
So, Charlie, what you're going through now

1032
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:49,831
is going to be horrible,
but it will be over.

1033
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:51,036
Thanks, Frank.

1034
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,670
- Another thing.
- Yeah?

1035
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:57,288
Fuck as many people
as you can right now.

1036
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:59,495
Women, men.

1037
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,880
- Take what I said seriously.
- You might need help wrapping the gauze.

1038
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,038
It needs to stay tight.

1039
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:05,825
Okay, I'm confused.

1040
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,956
What scene
is the Invisible Man outfit for?

1041
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,831
No, that's my Halloween costume,

1042
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:12,286
and the Frankenstein is for Henry.

1043
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:14,245
Oh, it's Frankenstein.

1044
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:17,383
He's coming here this weekend.
We're gonna trick or treat in the Slope.

1045
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,708
I made it more James Whale
than Kenneth Branagh.

1046
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:20,631
Perfect.

1047
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:21,748
Can I talk to you?

1048
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:23,955
Yeah, over...

1049
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:27,076
I've typed up the blocking
from the last two rehearsals,

1050
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:30,876
and here are the director notes
from that Danish production from the '70s.

1051
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Where'd you find it?

1052
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:34,633
The library, duh.

1053
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:37,245
Can I come over tonight?

1054
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,460
Mary Ann, it's too hard now.

1055
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,501
I just can't be with anyone right now.

1056
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:45,543
But we did it when you were married
and we shouldn't have done it.

1057
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,825
And now that you're not married,
shouldn't we be doing it?

1058
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:50,956
I'm not not married yet.

1059
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,705
You're torturing yourself.

1060
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,333
Just make sure
everything doesn't go to hell.

1061
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:58,538
- I'm relying on you, okay?
- Fine.

1062
00:50:58,625 --> 00:50:59,455
Thanks.

1063
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:01,461
I wish you'd accept generosity better.

1064
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:02,541
Hold on. Let me...

1065
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:05,001
- Hello?
- Is this Charlie Barber?

1066
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:06,455
Yes.

1067
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:08,291
Hi, this is Nora Fanshaw.

1068
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:10,125
I represent your wife, Nicole Barber.

1069
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:11,038
Hi.

1070
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:12,415
Do you have an attorney yet?

1071
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,330
No.

1072
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:15,786
Okay, then it's okay for me
to talk to you directly, okay?

1073
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:16,705
Okay.

1074
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:20,331
I'm calling because we haven't
received your response to our filing.

1075
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:23,746
Yeah, I've been rehearsing this play
and flying back and forth to LA.

1076
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:26,043
You're going to need
to file your response.

1077
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,330
Nicole said there was no rush.

1078
00:51:29,416 --> 00:51:31,956
It's been more than 30 days
since you were served.

1079
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:33,671
By law, you're meant to respond within...

1080
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,290
I didn't like the first lawyer I met.

1081
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,705
It says that very clearly
on the document you were given.

1082
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:38,791
Did you read it?

1083
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:40,705
Yeah, but I thought
that's just what it says.

1084
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:42,461
We weren't even gonna do it
with lawyers.

1085
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:45,826
Charlie, I think I shouldn't
tuck in my shirt.

1086
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:48,666
- Nicole said I could take my time.
- And we've let you take your time.

1087
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,750
- It comes out during the love scene.
- Could you hold?

1088
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:51,883
What love scene?

1089
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,288
When I hug Beth.

1090
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:54,375
You don't hug Beth.

1091
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,788
I think it's something
we should explore.

1092
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:59,785
Can't you just tuck it in tighter
or get Donna to safety pin it?

1093
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,915
I also have a kind of a thing

1094
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,460
- about tucking things in.
- Charlie?

1095
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,001
If you don't file your response,

1096
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:08,883
we'll file a request
for default judgment against you.

1097
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:11,208
Insecurities about my figure.

1098
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:12,581
- Charlie?
- Yes, sorry.

1099
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:14,746
Default judgment, what does that mean?
Don't hug Beth.

1100
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:17,213
We'll be able to lay claim
to whatever we want.

1101
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:19,001
What do you mean,
whatever you want of what?

1102
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:21,383
Your apartment, your things,
everything you own.

1103
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:22,328
We?

1104
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:25,416
She and I already discussed this.
We don't own that much stuff.

1105
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,750
She can have whatever she wants.

1106
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:29,633
And it means we'll set the number
of child support at its highest level

1107
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:31,828
and claim full custody of your child.

1108
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,041
Full custody?

1109
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,960
I mean, that's not even...

1110
00:52:38,041 --> 00:52:39,461
This is what the law says.

1111
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:43,126
Nicole's not going to do that.
I mean, she won't.

1112
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:47,248
Charlie, I represent Nicole, and she's
aware of everything I'm saying to you.

1113
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,040
I just spoke to her this morning.

1114
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,288
Well, I spoke to her five minutes
before I got on the call.

1115
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:56,883
Okay, so what do I do?

1116
00:52:56,958 --> 00:52:59,248
You need to get a lawyer
and respond immediately.

1117
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:02,673
Nicole wants to do this amicably,
but you're leaving us no other option.

1118
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,420
I'll get a lawyer.
Can I get a lawyer here?

1119
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,580
- I don't know where "here" is.
- New York.

1120
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:09,166
Ah! That's what all that honking is?

1121
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:11,666
No, you'll have to come to LA
and meet people in LA.

1122
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:12,710
I'm rehearsing a...

1123
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:15,631
If you don't respond in Los Angeles
by Friday, you'll leave us no choice.

1124
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:17,828
What? Which line?

1125
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:20,956
I have to take this.
Can you hold on a second, Charlie?

1126
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,080
Me and Mommy are in the middle
of a super secret treasure hunt.

1127
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:53,831
I thought the plane landed at 9:00.

1128
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:54,786
What are you wearing?

1129
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:55,875
Sock pants.

1130
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:57,418
It did. What are sock pants?

1131
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,420
He doesn't like to feel the breeze
on his legs.

1132
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,880
He dressed himself.

1133
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:02,668
There are long pants. Can I talk to you?

1134
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,670
- It's almost noon.
- There was traffic. We gotta get going.

1135
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:07,420
- Why don't we ever do a treasure hunt?
- Henry, can you wait a minute?

1136
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,710
No talking alone.

1137
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:11,001
Just one bit of talking alone,
then I'll be right there.

1138
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,830
I got a call from your lawyer.

1139
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,416
She said you'd take everything and...

1140
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:18,498
custody and everything
if I didn't respond.

1141
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:20,333
It's better if we let the lawyers do this.

1142
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:21,996
But she's saying things
I don't think you mean.

1143
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,420
Henry, we need to get going.

1144
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,040
I don't wanna go now.

1145
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:28,245
- Have you gotten a lawyer yet?
- That's what I'm here to do.

1146
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,883
Come on, Henry. I'm in a rush.

1147
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,128
I've three more clues.

1148
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:33,748
Why'd you start a treasure hunt
or whatever so close to my arrival?

1149
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:35,915
You were late. We were killing time.

1150
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,380
Honey, come. We're gonna finish
the treasure hunt later.

1151
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:39,458
- I'm gonna be rich.
- Okay.

1152
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,293
You're gonna go with your daddy,
it's gonna be fun.

1153
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,625
And I've got a present for you
when you get back as a reward.

1154
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:47,711
He's not going to the dentist.

1155
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:49,711
- I'm trying to help.
- I'm staying here.

1156
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:50,671
Come on.

1157
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,455
Henry?

1158
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:02,326
Got the booster?

1159
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:03,576
I have a booster.

1160
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:07,075
Oh, wait, no, it's not in.

1161
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,380
What's not in?

1162
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:10,751
The seat's not connected.

1163
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,673
I asked the rental company to install it.

1164
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,460
I think they can't
for liability reasons.

1165
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:20,916
- Do you know how these things...
- Let me just... Here, if you...

1166
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,540
- There should be a clip to clip onto.
- You have to.dig...

1167
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:29,831
Fuck!

1168
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:31,826
- Why fuck?
- Something sharp.

1169
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:33,166
Can't I stay with Mom?

1170
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,290
- No.
- Why not?

1171
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:36,375
It's my time with you.
I just flew 3,000 miles.

1172
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,328
I don't want to.

1173
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:38,826
Henry, get in the fuckin' car!

1174
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:43,286
I'm sorry, but, Jesus,
get in the fuckin' car.

1175
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:50,666
How do you spell Lego Bionicles?

1176
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,630
That's two words.
What does Lego start with?

1177
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,173
Just tell me.

1178
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,420
- Don't you wanna learn it?
- No.

1179
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,960
- It's on the box, anyway.
- I...

1180
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:58,251
Then what?

1181
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:01,083
E. You know,
everyone at the theater says hi.

1182
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,956
Hi. Then what?

1183
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,581
A "G" sound.

1184
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,630
- Are you excited for Halloween?
- J?

1185
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:07,578
G.

1186
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:09,286
- Then what?
- And an "O" sound.

1187
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:11,495
- O?
- Are you excited for Halloween?

1188
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:12,583
Yeah.

1189
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:14,166
Brought both our costumes.

1190
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,460
I'm going as a store-bought ninja.

1191
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,671
But we agreed.
I had Donna make you a Frankenstein.

1192
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,920
- I don't wanna be a Frankenstein anymore.
- Are you sure?

1193
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,710
Maybe just look at it.

1194
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:27,955
It's awesome. We'll be Frankenstein
and the Invisible Man.

1195
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:30,131
Mom bought me a ninja costume

1196
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:32,828
which is better because it costs more.

1197
00:56:32,916 --> 00:56:34,576
Technically, the Frankenstein cost more

1198
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:36,626
when you factor in Donna's time
and the materials.

1199
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:38,958
The cousins are also gonna be ninjas.

1200
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,751
But Henry,
we went through all this trouble.

1201
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:45,536
Okay.

1202
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:46,625
Whatever you want.

1203
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,503
Please take the ticket.

1204
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,790
- Dad, you're too far.
- I know.

1205
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,383
Please take the ticket.

1206
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:11,711
So I'm not comfortable
leaving the bags in the car

1207
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:13,961
where I've given the key to someone
I don't really know.

1208
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:15,131
I've been here.

1209
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:18,458
It's an office building,
so you've been to places like this before.

1210
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:20,633
I remember those fish.

1211
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:23,171
A lot of fish look the same.

1212
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:24,788
Can I help you?

1213
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:27,415
I'm Charlie Barber.
I have a 1:30 with Dan Cohen.

1214
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,080
Oh, hi. Where's your little man?

1215
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:32,626
I don't have it this time.
I keep my skeletons at my mom's.

1216
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:33,538
Okay.

1217
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,040
Oh, okay.

1218
00:57:36,291 --> 00:57:38,291
I'm sorry. We tried to reach you.

1219
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:40,075
Mr. Cohen wanted me to apologize.

1220
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:43,286
He can't see you because apparently
your wife already met with him

1221
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,625
on the 7th of August about representation.

1222
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:47,918
But she hired somebody else.

1223
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,290
- Nora...
- Fanshaw?

1224
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,130
But unfortunately, because she consulted
with Mr. Cohen already,

1225
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:55,078
he's legally barred from representing you.

1226
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:56,631
Oh.

1227
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,248
- Should we feed the fish?
- Yeah.

1228
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:01,461
- It happens all the time.
- Really?

1229
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:03,541
If you have a ticket,
I can validate your parking.

1230
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:05,251
Oh.

1231
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:08,325
It's common that people meet
with as many lawyers as possible

1232
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:10,416
so that their spouse has limited options.

1233
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,540
Oh, I don't think
she would've done it deliberately.

1234
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:13,875
You'd be surprised.

1235
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:16,745
Can all of them, like,
breathe out of the water?

1236
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:20,325
Do you go to a lot of offices
with your mom?

1237
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:21,745
Not so many.

1238
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,633
Like 11.

1239
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:27,328
I don't think anyone
would have stealed the bags, Daddy.

1240
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:28,626
I need somebody today.

1241
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:31,208
If I don't respond by tomorrow,
she said I could lose custody.

1242
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,210
I didn't know who else to call.
There's gotta be someone she didn't meet.

1243
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:35,331
I have a name for you.

1244
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:38,291
Bert Spitz.

1245
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:42,173
He was the entertainment lawyer
at Roberto's agency.

1246
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:43,495
Great.

1247
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:47,246
But then he kind of got pushed
into retirement a few years ago,

1248
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,083
and he went into family law.

1249
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:50,996
- I called him.
- Thank you, G-ma.

1250
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:53,753
- And he can see you today at three.
- Aw, shit.

1251
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:56,998
We never had this conversation,
Charlie-bird.

1252
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:59,383
- You got it. I love you.
- Dad!

1253
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,958
- I need a new burger.
- Why?

1254
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:06,415
Because you made us carry your bags
into the restaurant, I dropped it.

1255
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:09,995
That's fine. I'll give you mine.
Get in the car.

1256
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:13,418
Why did you bring me today
if you couldn't hang out with me?

1257
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,170
Because I've been away and wanna see you.

1258
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:19,423
Jamie Tuber has a little sister

1259
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,040
named Lily Tuber.

1260
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,665
- Yeah.
- And Lily Tuber is really bossy.

1261
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,130
Getting divorced with a kid can be
one of the hardest things you'll ever do.

1262
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,883
It's like a death without a body.

1263
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:39,331
I know personally.
I've been there four different times.

1264
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:40,706
You've been divorced four times?

1265
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,248
Married four times.

1266
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:43,666
Three divorces.

1267
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:46,503
This last one will stick, God willing.

1268
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,710
That's why I graduated into family law,

1269
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:52,211
to help people survive this painful time.

1270
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,208
Here's how I see it.

1271
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:59,581
If we get bogged down in "who did this"
and "who did that,"

1272
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:01,376
and "I don't want to pay the two dollars,"

1273
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:03,998
it'll just cost you more
in money and time and...

1274
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:06,125
emotional stress,

1275
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:08,708
and you'll probably end up
with the same result anyway.

1276
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:09,961
Right.

1277
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:13,331
I mean, I agree with that philosophy.
She does too, I'm sure.

1278
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:15,916
And I always go with the truth,
no matter where that takes us.

1279
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:18,416
Most people in my business
make up the truth

1280
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,000
so they can get where they need to go.

1281
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,670
You're just transactions to them.

1282
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,630
I like to think of you as people.

1283
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:25,828
Oh, okay, good.

1284
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:28,043
And not just you, her too.

1285
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:28,995
Yes.

1286
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,173
You know, this can be
a really ugly process.

1287
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,880
But I also believe
it doesn't have to be terrible.

1288
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:35,575
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1289
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:40,083
I'd love to keep expenses down
as much as possible.

1290
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,076
Of course you do.

1291
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:45,750
I charge 450 an hour
and I need a $10,000 retainer to start.

1292
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:49,501
I'll see if I can get an advance
on the Broadway transfer.

1293
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:52,383
And keep in mind
you'll have to pay for her lawyer.

1294
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:53,918
Oh. I didn't...

1295
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:58,293
- What?
- Well, at least part of her.

1296
01:00:58,375 --> 01:00:59,825
It doesn't make sense, does it?

1297
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:03,423
I mean, you're doing this
because you love your kid.

1298
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,330
And in doing so, you're draining money
from your kid's education.

1299
01:01:07,416 --> 01:01:09,376
- It seems ridiculous.
- Oh, it is.

1300
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,786
It is, boy.

1301
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:14,171
We'll have to respond right away.

1302
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,540
Your son goes to school out here?

1303
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,785
Yeah, temporarily, we agreed.

1304
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:22,826
Her pilot went to series
and I wanted to accommodate her.

1305
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:25,126
She's often felt we do things on my terms.

1306
01:01:25,208 --> 01:01:27,328
Be a better husband in divorce, huh?

1307
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,168
I guess something like that,
but we live in New York.

1308
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:33,463
Well, with your kid
going to school out here,

1309
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:34,921
the court may see it differently.

1310
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,040
Will we go to court?

1311
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:37,955
No, we don't wanna go to court.

1312
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:41,998
Courts in California are a disaster.
That's just how we have to think about it.

1313
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:45,078
I'm not sure these are my glasses.

1314
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:46,706
Where are you living while you're here?

1315
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,130
In a hotel right now.

1316
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,418
No, a hotel doesn't look good.

1317
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,960
- To who?
- The court.

1318
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,076
- You said we weren't going to go to court.
- No, of course.

1319
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:56,876
We have to prepare to go to court,
hoping we don't go to court.

1320
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:57,788
Okay.

1321
01:01:58,291 --> 01:01:59,711
You should get a place in LA.

1322
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:03,081
And get a place near her.
It looks better for custody reasons.

1323
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:05,286
She's in West Hollywood.
That'll be expensive.

1324
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:07,125
I guess I could rent
our New York apartment.

1325
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:08,128
Don't rent it.

1326
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:11,038
You have to continue to prove
New York residence.

1327
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:13,375
And, of course, you have a place in LA.

1328
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:15,748
It's hard to show you all live
in New York, isn't it?

1329
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:16,713
So...

1330
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:18,381
what do I do?

1331
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:22,245
I recommend you spend as much time
as you can with your son.

1332
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:25,081
Many people fight for that time,

1333
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:26,376
then they don't even use it.

1334
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:28,535
They just wanna win.

1335
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,535
This shouldn't be that complicated, right?

1336
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:32,498
I mean, we're a New York family.

1337
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,578
I think it's all
pretty straightforward. Right?

1338
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,456
I hope so, yes.

1339
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,170
I see no reason...

1340
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:43,000
you both love your child,

1341
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:45,461
you respect each other,

1342
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:47,581
why this shouldn't be
relatively pain-free.

1343
01:02:47,666 --> 01:02:50,786
- Right.
- I think you have my glasses.

1344
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,380
That makes sense.

1345
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:56,628
What have you been doing?

1346
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:58,168
Reading this magazine.

1347
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,210
You were reading California Lawyer?

1348
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:01,131
Yeah.

1349
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:02,668
Okay, I'm almost done.

1350
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:06,291
I wouldn't expect too much from that cat.

1351
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:10,381
What kind of pet do you want?

1352
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:11,288
I don't know...

1353
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,995
I want you to know
that eventually this will all be over,

1354
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:15,883
and whatever we win or lose...

1355
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:19,416
it'll be the two of you
having to figure this out together.

1356
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:21,246
Thank you.

1357
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:24,543
Your the first person in this process
who's spoken to me like a human.

1358
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:32,626
You remind me of myself
on my second marriage.

1359
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:38,286
Come! Oh!

1360
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,290
You have fun with Daddy?

1361
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:41,665
We drove around to offices.

1362
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:44,170
Oh. Do you wanna see your ninja costume?

1363
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,540
It's on G-ma's bed.

1364
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:46,745
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

1365
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:51,708
You know, I had Donna build him
this whole Frankenstein thing

1366
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:53,251
with plugs and...

1367
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:55,713
Yeah, well, the cousins are ninjas,
so he wanted to do that...

1368
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:57,541
He and I had decided together.

1369
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,535
Oh, well, I can't make him
be Frankenstein.

1370
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,625
I'm not asking you to,
but maybe you can help me out a little.

1371
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:04,668
I'll leave the Frankenstein here, maybe
you can nudge him in that direction.

1372
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:06,131
I'll try.

1373
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:08,711
What's the...

1374
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:11,751
Did you dye your hair again?
Is that for your show?

1375
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:14,921
No, this is me. It was this way
when I saw you before.

1376
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,790
I know, but I didn't say anything then.

1377
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:19,128
You don't like it?

1378
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:22,498
No, I guess it's fine.
Is it shorter? I prefer longer but...

1379
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:27,543
Sorry, it's just absurd.

1380
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:29,246
Is everything okay?

1381
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:30,963
Yeah. Why?

1382
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:34,038
You seem, I don't know,
like something is...

1383
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:35,245
Everything's fine.

1384
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,000
Okay, I'm gonna check in at the hotel,

1385
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:42,173
but I should be able
to get to you guys by 5:00, 5:30...

1386
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:44,500
We're going to Cassie's
in Pasadena,

1387
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:46,293
and trick-or-treating with the cousins.

1388
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:48,285
- Cassie lives in Pasadena now?
- Yes.

1389
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:51,325
- She and Sam moved there a couple months...
- I don't really know Pasadena.

1390
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:54,246
- I'll figure it out. What's the address?
- My mom is looking forward to it.

1391
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:55,833
- I'll text Sam.
- Cassie and Sam are mad.

1392
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:57,831
- Mad at who?
- You.

1393
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:00,076
- Cassie and Sam?
- You can understand that.

1394
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:02,376
So I think we should probably
do separate Halloweens.

1395
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,955
But if you're okay with it,
then shouldn't they be okay with it?

1396
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:07,291
- Let's do it this way this time.
- Do you not want me there?

1397
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:08,245
I'm fine with it.

1398
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,293
- Okay.
- It'll be nice for him.

1399
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:11,705
He'll have two Halloweens.

1400
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:15,995
What am I gonna do with him for second
Halloween? Walk around Sunset Boulevard?

1401
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,753
Maybe the hotel has something.

1402
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,790
Or you can drive
to a different neighborhood.

1403
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:26,421
Sun sets forever.

1404
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:31,543
There shall never be another dawn.

1405
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:32,455
No!

1406
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,463
Lady...

1407
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:39,503
I require the solace of the shadows

1408
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:41,883
and the dark...

1409
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:04,461
Okay, ready for Halloween?

1410
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:06,916
- Hi.
- Wow, elaborate.

1411
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:09,955
Don't forget to wear your jacket.
It's getting colder.

1412
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:11,751
- This is a nice house.
- Ready to go back out?

1413
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:13,333
- He has to pee.
- No, I don't.

1414
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:14,286
He does.

1415
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:17,125
Some of his men are in here
and also Bear-Bear.

1416
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:19,038
You can keep that Bear-Bear.
I got another one.

1417
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,825
Does he know
that there are two Bear-Bears?

1418
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:23,416
- It was his idea.
- David Bowie, right? Station to Station?

1419
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,081
Let's Dance.

1420
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:28,495
Henry, have a great Halloween
with Daddy, okay?

1421
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:31,288
Have fun.

1422
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,250
Go pee and then we're going back out.

1423
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:38,421
I'm too tired.

1424
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,920
Go pee and then we're gonna go drive
to Halloween.

1425
01:06:41,541 --> 01:06:43,171
This block looks promising.

1426
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,418
I wish Halloween was over.

1427
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,040
Well, it isn't.

1428
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:49,625
If we were in New York,
we could be walking.

1429
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:51,748
But I like how we're sitting right now.

1430
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:52,883
I like to sit.

1431
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:56,541
That's true, Los Angeles
does have sitting going for it.

1432
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:59,543
I think that's why
I like Los Angeles better.

1433
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:00,705
Because you get to sit?

1434
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:02,921
And because I like my friends here better.

1435
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,250
That's not true.

1436
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:07,253
What about Horatio and Poppy?

1437
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:09,383
Horatio doesn't like me anymore.

1438
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:11,495
And I don't like Poppy.

1439
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:13,043
Here I have Axel.

1440
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:15,955
Axel's hilarious.
I think you'd like him, Dad.

1441
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:18,251
And my family's here.

1442
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:20,418
Besides you.

1443
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:49,713
Everyone's asleep.

1444
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:42,211
I need to pee!

1445
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,251
Who gave you a lighter?

1446
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:54,286
Lift the seat.

1447
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,746
Gonna have to go back to New York
on Monday.

1448
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:04,211
Did you flush?

1449
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,043
Wash your hands.

1450
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:14,963
Will you play with me?

1451
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:17,793
I'm tired, honey.

1452
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,326
Did you hear me?
I have to go back to New York.

1453
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:34,456
Ah, watch out! I'm falling!

1454
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:40,041
You didn't catch me.

1455
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:43,666
Okay?

1456
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:45,791
Why aren't you here more?

1457
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:48,955
I have to work.

1458
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:51,333
You know my play is opening on Broadway.

1459
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:54,378
Is it because you don't wanna
be around Mom?

1460
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,288
No.

1461
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,580
You know, like we talked about,

1462
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:59,206
we both decided not to be together
no matter where we are,

1463
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:00,881
but we both wanna be with you.

1464
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:04,036
But you're not near me
if you're in New York.

1465
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,383
Well, we also live in New York.

1466
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,043
Yeah, but I go to school here.

1467
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:10,713
Just for right now.

1468
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,915
Like that time we were in Copenhagen
for my play.

1469
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,790
Remember all those kids in buckets?

1470
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:20,211
I like my school here, and Mom says
we could stay here if we want.

1471
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:23,208
What do you mean?

1472
01:10:25,291 --> 01:10:26,291
She said that?

1473
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:27,288
Yeah.

1474
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,130
- Hello?
- Are you moving out here?

1475
01:10:58,666 --> 01:10:59,916
- Did you find a lawyer?
- Yes.

1476
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,330
Henry says you're moving here.

1477
01:11:01,416 --> 01:11:02,666
Have your lawyer call Nora.

1478
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,080
I wanna talk about it as us.

1479
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:05,206
Who the fuck is us?

1480
01:11:05,291 --> 01:11:07,331
Let's just get in a room, you and me.

1481
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:08,826
That's what we always said we'd do.

1482
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:11,376
- My lawyers wouldn't let me sign anything.
- It's not up to them. It's our divorce.

1483
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:13,668
They say I could later sue them
for malpractice.

1484
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:16,003
What am I walking into?

1485
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,463
What are you walking into?

1486
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:19,171
Yes, what the fuck is going on?

1487
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:22,880
I read your fucking emails, Charlie!
I read them all.

1488
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:25,208
- When?
- I don't know, recently.

1489
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:26,631
- Shit.
- You're a fucking liar.

1490
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:29,328
- You fucked Mary Ann!
- It was after I was sleeping on the couch.

1491
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:31,376
It was bullshit about working on us.

1492
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:33,128
You know what? I have been working.

1493
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:34,828
I've been doing the work alone.

1494
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,246
How did you read my emails?

1495
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,713
I hacked into your account, you dumb fuck!

1496
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:39,921
I think that's illegal!

1497
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,750
Don't give me this shit
about being surprised about LA.

1498
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,333
Surprise! I have my own opinions.

1499
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:46,576
How do you even know
how to do something like that?

1500
01:11:46,666 --> 01:11:48,246
I want things that aren't what you want,

1501
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:50,543
because, surprise,
you were fucking another lady.

1502
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:53,745
It was one time! I think you're conflating
two different things.

1503
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,503
Mary Ann has nothing to do with LA.

1504
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:57,133
I am conflating, motherfucker!

1505
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,708
You watch me conflate!

1506
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:04,878
Did you just stamp your foot?

1507
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:07,748
I don't think I've ever done that before.
I'm just so angry.

1508
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:11,500
You look like you needed one.

1509
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:12,793
Yes, I do, thanks.

1510
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:17,038
You know, the Japanese are making
really interesting tequila right now.

1511
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:18,961
That's exciting, I guess.

1512
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,543
What are you so angry about?

1513
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:22,995
Fucking ex-husband.

1514
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:26,828
I spent all this time feeling guilty,
and he's so self-absorbed.

1515
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:27,786
It's pointless.

1516
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,173
It's a game I'm playing with myself.

1517
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:34,375
Oh, hey, Pablo. We met at...

1518
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:36,498
- Oh, you held the bounce board.
- The flirty grip.

1519
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:42,666
- Here's what I want you to only do, okay?
- What?

1520
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,001
I want you to finger me.

1521
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,960
- What?
- Just finger me.

1522
01:12:46,416 --> 01:12:48,666
- Okay.
- That's all we'll do, just fingering.

1523
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:49,996
Okay?

1524
01:12:50,416 --> 01:12:52,126
I'm changing my whole fucking life.

1525
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:01,881
Nicole and Charlie's son, Henry,
was born here in Los Angeles.

1526
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:05,538
He currently attends Laurel Elementary
in Laurel Canyon,

1527
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:07,075
and Nicole works in Hollywood

1528
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:10,036
while also maintaining a full schedule
as a mother

1529
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:12,825
with classes of swim, art,

1530
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:15,746
gym, and music, as well as play groups.

1531
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:19,825
Nicole is Henry's
primary custodial parent,

1532
01:13:19,916 --> 01:13:24,286
and to the extent that Charlie would like
to exercise his custodial time,

1533
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:27,575
he should be making efforts
to visit Henry here in California.

1534
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:29,536
Nora, you seem to be ignoring the fact

1535
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:32,875
that they lived in New York for ten years.

1536
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:36,248
My client worked in New York
for several years, that's true.

1537
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,633
But Nicole was born and bred
right here in LA.

1538
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:42,500
She and Charlie would come here
most holidays and summers

1539
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:43,753
to spend time with her family,

1540
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:45,333
who all live in LA.

1541
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:47,916
She and Charlie were married in LA.

1542
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:49,961
Would you like to see the photos?

1543
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:51,831
No, I don't need to see the photos.

1544
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:54,251
Although I'm sure
they both look beautiful.

1545
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:57,918
It's my client's expectation

1546
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,500
that after this TV show is completed,

1547
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:02,463
the parties will move back to New York

1548
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,421
where they currently keep an apartment.

1549
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,670
And it's my understanding
that Charlie promised Nicole

1550
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,670
that they would spend more time
in Los Angeles

1551
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:10,920
during the marriage.

1552
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,920
But because of his insistence
that his work keep them in New York,

1553
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,960
Nicole ended up staying there much longer
than she ever anticipated.

1554
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:21,461
In fact, a few years ago,

1555
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:24,331
Charlie was offered a residency
at the Geffen Playhouse

1556
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
that would have taken his work
and his family

1557
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:30,125
to Los Angeles for a year.

1558
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:32,206
And he...

1559
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:33,665
turned it down.

1560
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,208
Even though that was Nicole's desire.

1561
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:40,421
He wanted to maintain consistency
for his family and his child.

1562
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,790
Was this the same consistency
he wanted to maintain

1563
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:46,285
when they went to Copenhagen
for six months so he could direct a play?

1564
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:49,415
Now, while I understand that Charlie
lives in New York...

1565
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:52,326
and when it's convenient
to his work schedule,

1566
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:54,206
he flies out to see his son...

1567
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:56,381
He flies out here every chance he gets
at great expense.

1568
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,708
I don't see any reason you can't
be out here full-time.

1569
01:14:58,791 --> 01:15:00,131
He makes his living in New York.

1570
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:02,828
- Sorry, do we want to contemplate lunch?
- Good idea.

1571
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:04,826
I'll order now so it'll comes
when we're hungry.

1572
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:05,876
Yeah.

1573
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,078
Everyone good with Manny's?

1574
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:07,996
I'd love Manny's.

1575
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:10,498
Have you had Manny's?

1576
01:15:11,166 --> 01:15:12,036
You'll love it.

1577
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:14,745
Just really yummy sandwiches and salads.

1578
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:16,423
I'll have the BLT.

1579
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,380
Dad?

1580
01:15:18,083 --> 01:15:19,173
Turkey.

1581
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,500
I'll have the BLT.

1582
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:22,423
- You'll have the kale?
- Kale salad.

1583
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,710
I don't know, sorry.

1584
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:45,253
Charlie will have...

1585
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:48,168
the Greek salad,

1586
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:51,670
but with lemon and olive oil
instead of the Greek dressing.

1587
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:52,790
Okay.

1588
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:54,875
- I'll have the Chinese chicken salad.
- Okay, sure.

1589
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:55,998
- Thank you.
- Yep.

1590
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,420
Congratulations, Charlie, on your grant.
Nicole told me.

1591
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,630
Oh, thank you.

1592
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:05,078
He's a genius.

1593
01:16:06,416 --> 01:16:07,456
Well, I told Nicole,

1594
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,171
I loved your play.

1595
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,210
- Oh, thanks.
- Really.

1596
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,213
You are one smart cookie.

1597
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,500
Oh, thanks.

1598
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:17,173
I would just love to...

1599
01:16:17,916 --> 01:16:20,126
crawl inside that brain.

1600
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:24,833
There was that one moment
when you smell the toast. Smell!

1601
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:28,711
It was literally my favorite thing
that I saw that year.

1602
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:31,251
- Thanks.
- Truly genius.

1603
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:32,173
Thank you.

1604
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:35,380
I was sorry to hear it closed on Broadway.

1605
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:36,958
They couldn't smell the toast.

1606
01:16:38,416 --> 01:16:40,206
It was so emotional.

1607
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,540
It's very competitive, I imagine.

1608
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:48,578
Now, when Charlie is in Los Angeles,

1609
01:16:48,666 --> 01:16:51,786
Nicole, of course,
agrees that it will be best for Henry

1610
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:54,918
that he see each parent equally.

1611
01:16:57,166 --> 01:17:00,166
It's very nice out here, Charlie.
You should give it a chance.

1612
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:02,710
Yeah, and the space... can't beat it.

1613
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:04,001
I love it too.

1614
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:07,996
But all of our personal feelings
about the two cities aside,

1615
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:12,253
we don't share your assertion
that the couple is an LA-based family.

1616
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:14,793
It was very clearly their deal

1617
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:18,075
that they would go back to New York
after Nicole finished her show.

1618
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:19,626
I'm not aware of any deal.

1619
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:22,496
I didn't get it in writing.

1620
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:28,171
Charlie, is this like the deal
that you made

1621
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:31,580
that you Nicole would spend more time
in LA during your marriage?

1622
01:17:31,666 --> 01:17:34,496
We didn't have a deal.
It was something we discussed.

1623
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:35,828
But...

1624
01:17:35,916 --> 01:17:38,666
So it's a deal
when it's something you want

1625
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,830
and a discussion when Nicole wants it?

1626
01:17:44,166 --> 01:17:45,076
Sidebar...

1627
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:49,168
Nora, do you have a spare office
where Charlie and I can sidebar?

1628
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,420
Sure.

1629
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,920
- Can you...
- I can show you.

1630
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:53,421
Come on.

1631
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:02,208
- Nora is a very good lawyer.
- Uh-huh.

1632
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:04,713
- Tough, right?
- Yeah.

1633
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:08,285
And you're in a bind because you've shown
you're willing to fly out here

1634
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:10,075
and rent an apartment to see your son.

1635
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:12,166
- You told me to do that.
- I know that.

1636
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,250
And I'm doing that because I want
to see my kid, not to set a precedent.

1637
01:18:15,333 --> 01:18:17,833
Yes, but unfortunately,
you are setting a precedent.

1638
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:20,376
And a judge might look at it that way.

1639
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:23,668
What's the alternative? I stay in New York
and never come out here?

1640
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,710
No, because then it would look
to the court

1641
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,671
like you don't care about seeing your son.

1642
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:28,880
Court or no court?

1643
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:30,828
Stop saying "court"
and then "never court."

1644
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:33,536
Well, the way this is going,
we may have to go to court.

1645
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:36,293
Are you aware of how maddening you sound?

1646
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:37,285
I am.

1647
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:40,133
And I know it seems unfair.

1648
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:45,213
But imagine if you were...

1649
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:49,125
a poor mother whose husband abandons her

1650
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:50,918
and then refuses to pay anything.

1651
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:55,380
That's what the system
is trying to protect people from.

1652
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:58,455
Listen...

1653
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:00,786
if I were representing you...

1654
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:02,035
You are representing me.

1655
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,575
Right, no, of course. No.

1656
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:08,325
I don't see a judge
moving this child from California.

1657
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:10,206
I think we try and settle today.

1658
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,580
"Settle" meaning... what?

1659
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:15,788
- She gets LA.
- No, Bert, just...

1660
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:17,916
No.

1661
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,705
I mean, we have to win this.

1662
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:22,786
Remember,
the win is what's best for Henry.

1663
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:25,285
And if you guys go to court,
he's gonna get pulled into it.

1664
01:19:25,375 --> 01:19:28,535
But if he stays here
and I stay in New York, that's just...

1665
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:29,875
then I won't...

1666
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:32,535
I'll never get
to really be his parent again.

1667
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:33,455
It'll be different.

1668
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:34,581
It won't exist.

1669
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:36,463
So maybe you move here.

1670
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:38,746
You heard what Amir said
about the space?

1671
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:41,463
Fuck the space, Bert! Fuck the space!

1672
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:44,921
I'll do whatever you want me to do,
but this is my advice.

1673
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,210
I've seen these things go on and on,

1674
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:50,165
and the burden of these battles
is immeasurable.

1675
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:54,290
I had a client get colon cancer and die
before he and his wife came to agreement.

1676
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:55,955
What about filing in New York?

1677
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:56,963
It's too late.

1678
01:19:57,333 --> 01:19:59,293
And even if you did,
I don't think it would matter.

1679
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:01,375
They're being reasonable financially,
you know?

1680
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:04,038
You're lucky they didn't ask
for half your grant money.

1681
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:06,745
She wouldn't do that. She knows
I put all that money back in my theater.

1682
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:08,423
If this continues, she might.

1683
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:11,125
The actors and crew
all rely on that money.

1684
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:13,248
A court would never agree
with this, right?

1685
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:16,253
Whether they do or not,
it'll cost you half your grant money

1686
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:17,673
to go to court and prove it.

1687
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:21,955
I feel like a criminal.

1688
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:24,423
But you didn't commit any crime.

1689
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,830
It doesn't feel that way.

1690
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:28,286
If we give on LA right now,

1691
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:30,245
and then try to make
the best deal possible,

1692
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,293
I think we can get her
to give on other fronts.

1693
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:34,285
There are no other fronts!

1694
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:36,500
This is the thing!

1695
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,206
He needs to know that I fought for him!

1696
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,131
He'll know.

1697
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:57,378
I should never have let her
come out here with Henry.

1698
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:59,963
If it wasn't LA or New York,
it'd be something else.

1699
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:03,501
You'd be fighting about a house
or a school district or...

1700
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:05,963
You know what this is like?

1701
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:10,081
This is like that joke about the woman
at the hairdresser, she's going to Rome.

1702
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:11,576
- You know this?
- I don't.

1703
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:14,083
This woman is at her hairdresser
and she says,

1704
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:15,576
"I'm going to Rome on holiday."

1705
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:18,206
And he says, "Oh, really?
What airline are you taking?"

1706
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,881
She says, "Alitalia."

1707
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,878
He says, "Alitalia? Are you crazy?"

1708
01:21:21,958 --> 01:21:24,328
That's the worst...
That's terrible. Don't take that."

1709
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:25,916
He says, "Where are you gonna stay?"

1710
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,630
She says, "I'm gonna stay at the Hassler."

1711
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:29,878
"The Hassler? What, are you kidding?"

1712
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:32,958
They're renovating the Hassler.
You'll hear hammering all night long.

1713
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:34,921
"You won't sleep. What are you gonna see?"

1714
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,420
She says, "I think I'm gonna try
to go to the Vatican."

1715
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,880
"The Vatican?
You'll be standing in line all day long.

1716
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:41,078
You'll never see anything..."

1717
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:43,166
I'm sorry, Bert,
am I paying for this joke?

1718
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:48,075
Whatever happens here, it's temporary.

1719
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:51,958
He's growing up.
He's gonna have opinions on the subject.

1720
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:54,245
Time is on your side, Charlie.

1721
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:58,208
Maybe he'll do college on the East Coast.

1722
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:11,173
I have most of my coins,
like my quarters and dimes at Daddy's,

1723
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:15,250
but I'm keeping my dollars
and my one twenty at yours, okay?

1724
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:18,575
So that is one twenty

1725
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:21,496
plus 50, what is that? Goddamn it.

1726
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:23,133
What's "Goddamn it"?

1727
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:25,038
Did you guys lose power where you are?

1728
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:26,075
Dad?

1729
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:27,166
Did we lose power?

1730
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,580
No.

1731
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:31,625
There's rolling blackouts
in the hills and now...

1732
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:35,083
Oh, damn it. Now the gate won't close.

1733
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:36,626
Her gate won't close.

1734
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:43,038
Mom!

1735
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:49,245
- Can we go see my room?
- Yeah, of course.

1736
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:50,963
- Tried all the...
- I tried everything.

1737
01:22:51,041 --> 01:22:52,791
Sorry I made you come out.

1738
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:53,785
It's fine.

1739
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:55,495
- I just...
- You don't want your gate open.

1740
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:56,788
Right.

1741
01:22:57,291 --> 01:22:58,831
Should be a panel or something
on the side...

1742
01:22:58,916 --> 01:23:00,456
Maybe this is something here.

1743
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:04,253
- It's a cute house.
- Oh, yeah.

1744
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:06,083
I mean, from what I can see.

1745
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:06,996
Thanks.

1746
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:11,996
Getting shaggy.

1747
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:14,793
Yeah, I have to find a hair cutter.

1748
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:17,380
You want me to cut it?

1749
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:19,131
Okay.

1750
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:31,208
Close your eyes.

1751
01:23:36,291 --> 01:23:37,171
He's out.

1752
01:23:37,791 --> 01:23:39,291
Maybe he should stay here tonight.

1753
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:41,581
It's my night.

1754
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,460
Hey, come on. We're going.
Come on. Let's take a walk. Right?

1755
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:15,751
Yeah, we're gonna take a walk. Let...
We're taking a walk.

1756
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:18,003
We're mostly finished.

1757
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:21,503
Bert and I hammered out 90 percent
of the details,

1758
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:24,583
and there's a couple minor things hanging,

1759
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:25,916
but it should be easy.

1760
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,995
And then the judge
makes your divorce official.

1761
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:31,078
Oh. That's good.

1762
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:35,666
- Fuck me.
- What?

1763
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:37,833
Who's that?

1764
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:41,711
- Charlie, you shouldn't have done this.
- What do you mean? Where's Bert?

1765
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:46,333
This means that everything
we've agreed upon now is off the table.

1766
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:47,576
We've got LA, right?

1767
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,626
Not with Jay Marotta representing him.

1768
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:51,666
This is a street fight now.

1769
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:55,290
And I'm gonna have to ask for things
that we wouldn't normally ask for.

1770
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:58,330
This system rewards bad behavior.

1771
01:24:59,833 --> 01:25:01,173
- Jay.
- Hey.

1772
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,170
Hi.

1773
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:04,540
I saw Miriam at Madeo the other night.

1774
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:06,625
- Yeah?
- Looking very handsome.

1775
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:09,248
You know, you should come
to our Stand Up To Cancer event.

1776
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:11,583
- John Legend's gonna play.
- Oh, I love him.

1777
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:13,536
Okay. It's gonna be
at the Beverly Hilton, I think.

1778
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:14,455
- Great.
- Okay?

1779
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:17,001
- She said you're spending time in Malibu.
- Oh, really?

1780
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:20,213
Me too. Haven't seen her
since that building was ICM.

1781
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:22,381
A little history.

1782
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:26,133
Ten years ago, Charlie takes a risk

1783
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:28,788
when he first hires Nicole as an actress

1784
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,745
in his play in New York City.

1785
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:34,168
He's a well-regarded
up-and-coming director

1786
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:35,460
of the avant-garde.

1787
01:25:35,958 --> 01:25:37,168
And she's known

1788
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:41,210
as the girl in that college sex movie
who takes her top off.

1789
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:43,456
- My client will not be slut-shamed...
- Ten years on...

1790
01:25:43,541 --> 01:25:45,631
- for an artistic choice.
- and many prestigious

1791
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:47,128
theater roles later...

1792
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:50,673
She becomes an actress
of great credibility.

1793
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,790
And it's because of that credibility,

1794
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:56,625
that she's offered the lead role
in a major television show.

1795
01:25:56,708 --> 01:26:00,128
This new opportunity is thanks to Charlie.

1796
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:04,078
Your Honor, we shouldn't have
to pay support money at this point.

1797
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:08,793
In fact, Charlie is entitled
to half her TV money,

1798
01:26:09,416 --> 01:26:11,876
present and future earnings of the show.

1799
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:18,540
Charlie's just received
the enormous sum of $650,000

1800
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,165
in the form of a MacArthur grant.

1801
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,170
- Of which he gets...
- This is for the theater work...

1802
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:25,000
- in $125,000 installments...
- he conducted during the marriage.

1803
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:26,253
Over five years.

1804
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:28,173
- So by Jay's same logic...
- He uses the money...

1805
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:31,040
- that Nicole contributed to.
- to employ actors and crew members...

1806
01:26:31,125 --> 01:26:34,035
- One at a time, please.
- and to pay debts that he's accumulated

1807
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:36,875
with his theater company
that stars his wife.

1808
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:42,078
- Bless you.
- Not only did she turn down a lucrative

1809
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:44,206
and successful career in movies

1810
01:26:44,291 --> 01:26:46,501
to perform in his little theater,

1811
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:49,293
but she actually supplied Charlie

1812
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:51,075
with a loan early on to help out.

1813
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:53,666
- Which he paid back.
- She lent her name to the marquee,

1814
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,000
which was the principle reason
people came to the theater.

1815
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:57,793
That may have been true ten years ago.

1816
01:26:58,458 --> 01:27:01,958
And in turn, she helped establish
Charlie's reputation.

1817
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:04,083
Now, over the next ten years,

1818
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:07,246
she was subsequently offered parts
in movies, TV shows,

1819
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,833
most of which she turned down
at Charlie's behest

1820
01:27:09,916 --> 01:27:12,456
to be a mom and act in his plays.

1821
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:17,081
So while we are willing
to be flexible on support,

1822
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:20,826
we contend that half of Charlie's
grant money be split between the parties.

1823
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:23,456
I don't see how you can claim
that she gets half a grant

1824
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:25,421
dedicated to his genius.

1825
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,000
He became a genius
during the course of the marriage.

1826
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:28,173
Oh, come on, Nora.

1827
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:31,000
Charlie himself, upon hearing
that he received the prize,

1828
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:33,213
told Nicole that it belonged to her too.

1829
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,706
That's what people say
when they win awards.

1830
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,750
No, he was implying what was true.

1831
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:42,918
His genius was an intangible asset
built during the marriage.

1832
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,170
Nora, I like how you refer
to Charlie's theater

1833
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:48,830
as a ramshackle downtown dump

1834
01:27:48,916 --> 01:27:50,416
when you're arguing custody,

1835
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,580
but when you want more money,

1836
01:27:52,666 --> 01:27:55,246
he's a big, rich, genius
Broadway director.

1837
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:56,463
You can't have it both ways.

1838
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:57,881
Oh, really? Why not?

1839
01:27:58,083 --> 01:28:00,333
And whether you think
it's fair or not, Jay,

1840
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,580
the first monetary installment
from the MacArthur grant

1841
01:28:03,666 --> 01:28:06,206
was put into a joint
marital accountant, and thus...

1842
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:09,081
Fuck. You shouldn't have put
that money in a joint account.

1843
01:28:09,166 --> 01:28:12,126
There's not gonna be anything left,
anyway. I'm using it all to divorce her.

1844
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:14,788
Nora, I have to say
that your account of this marriage

1845
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:17,325
takes place in an alternate reality.

1846
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,170
By suddenly moving to LA

1847
01:28:20,583 --> 01:28:23,503
and insisting on an LA residence,

1848
01:28:23,583 --> 01:28:25,713
Nicole is withholding Henry...

1849
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:28,501
- Counsel, please be seated.
- alienating him from his father,

1850
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,463
which has turned Charlie's world
upside down.

1851
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:33,001
- Counselor?
- It amounts to an ambush.

1852
01:28:33,083 --> 01:28:35,503
"Witholding," Jay? Really? "Alienating"?

1853
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:37,383
Well, those are fighting words,

1854
01:28:37,458 --> 01:28:40,328
and it's simply false and does nothing
to further this settlement.

1855
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:44,375
Your recap of the situation is outrageous.

1856
01:28:44,458 --> 01:28:47,538
And although California is,
without doubt, a no-fault state,

1857
01:28:47,625 --> 01:28:50,825
it bears mentioning
in the accurate recap of the situation

1858
01:28:50,916 --> 01:28:52,706
that Charlie had had extramarital affairs.

1859
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:55,461
- An extramarital affair.
- Do you really want me to go there?

1860
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:57,461
- Yeah, let's go there.
- Okay.

1861
01:28:57,541 --> 01:29:00,751
Nicole has admitted
to hacking Charlie's computer

1862
01:29:00,833 --> 01:29:02,133
and reading his emails,

1863
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,578
which, if proven, is a felony.

1864
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:06,788
And, Nora,
I don't think you'll be too happy

1865
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:10,205
if I ask Nicole about her alcohol
consumption in the evenings.

1866
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:11,131
What?

1867
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:16,128
She confided in Charlie recently,
having just carried Henry to bed,

1868
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:20,578
that she was having trouble standing
while walking down the staircase.

1869
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:24,251
And from what I understand,
this is not an isolated event.

1870
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:26,633
So you let me know, Nora,

1871
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,918
- and will go there as needed.
- Charlie?

1872
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:31,128
Can I ask you,

1873
01:29:31,208 --> 01:29:33,128
how do you expect
to have more time with Henry

1874
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:35,578
when you don't exercise the time
you already have?

1875
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:37,876
And exercise it responsibly?

1876
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,290
On a recent visit to Los Angeles,

1877
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,995
after failing to call, text,

1878
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:46,503
communicate in any way, shape, or form,

1879
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:48,963
Charlie finally arrived two hours late
to pick up Henry

1880
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:50,131
at Nicole's mother's house.

1881
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:52,078
At that point, the car seat,

1882
01:29:52,166 --> 01:29:55,916
which he had assured Nicole
had been professionally installed,

1883
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,460
was clearly not even belted in.

1884
01:29:57,541 --> 01:30:00,291
- It was sitting in the back seat.
- You have to buckle in the car seat.

1885
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:01,375
- It's the law.
- I know that.

1886
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:03,628
- I thought the rental place did it.
- No, they can't do it. It's a liability.

1887
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:05,958
I know that now.
Once we discovered that, we fixed it.

1888
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:06,961
Counsel?

1889
01:30:07,958 --> 01:30:09,578
You can see my courtroom is full

1890
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:13,206
and there are people who don't have
the resources your clients have,

1891
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:16,793
and I'm fairly certain
you haven't exhausted, in good faith,

1892
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:19,205
the arguments in the case of this child.

1893
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:21,791
In the meantime,
we'll keep the status quo.

1894
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:25,325
This remains an LA family
for the time being.

1895
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,000
I took over this department recently,

1896
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:31,333
and I'm still becoming acquainted
with the cases.

1897
01:30:31,416 --> 01:30:35,286
So I'm going to appoint
an expert evaluator

1898
01:30:35,791 --> 01:30:38,711
who knows much more
about young children than I do.

1899
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:41,745
Once the evaluation is done,

1900
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:44,463
we'll modify the orders where necessary.

1901
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:50,576
Hey.

1902
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:52,380
Hey, where's Henry?

1903
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:55,128
He's with Cassie and her kids
at laser tag.

1904
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:57,325
You want something to drink?

1905
01:30:57,416 --> 01:31:01,076
I have unfiltered tap water,
beer, and some juice boxes.

1906
01:31:01,541 --> 01:31:02,541
I'll take a juice box.

1907
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:10,288
You don't have anything on the walls?

1908
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:12,671
I don't have anything
except Henry's art,

1909
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:13,920
which is being framed.

1910
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,670
I can give you some stuff,

1911
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,630
you know, till you get some things.

1912
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:21,211
How about that great picture
of Henry on the Staten Island ferry?

1913
01:31:21,666 --> 01:31:22,626
Aren't you in that one?

1914
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:25,995
I guess I... I guess you can cut me out.

1915
01:31:26,083 --> 01:31:28,463
I'm gonna have to leave a day early
to go to New York on the 22nd.

1916
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:30,711
So I was wondering
if I could take Henry that Friday.

1917
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:33,750
The 22nd, so that's the 21st?

1918
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:36,503
We have plans, actually.

1919
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:39,463
We're going to something at LACMA
with the cousins.

1920
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:41,915
But could you change it
so I could take him?

1921
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:44,576
It's just one night.
He's looking forward to it.

1922
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:48,036
- Really?
- It's my night, Charlie, we negotiated it.

1923
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:49,535
Okay, fine.

1924
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:51,793
But what?

1925
01:31:51,875 --> 01:31:53,785
No, I'm just asking you to be flexible.

1926
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:56,705
I am flexible. You come in and out
and I adjust based on your schedule.

1927
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:59,751
- This one night we have tickets to...
- It's not only this one night, but fine.

1928
01:32:00,125 --> 01:32:01,825
Henry's teacher wants to meet with us.

1929
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:03,376
You mean his LA teacher?

1930
01:32:03,541 --> 01:32:06,381
Can you answer the email
so we could set a time?

1931
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:08,250
Yeah, I've been distracted.

1932
01:32:09,333 --> 01:32:10,333
I understand.

1933
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:13,415
They just wanna rule out everything,
you know, with his reading.

1934
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:16,630
I just think he's a little over-anxious.
I think he wants it too much.

1935
01:32:17,166 --> 01:32:19,166
They said he's off the charts in math.

1936
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:21,420
He quits too easily
when things aren't easy for him.

1937
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,170
You know, he's like us, he's stubborn.

1938
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,250
He's still a lousy Monopoly player
'cause he tries to save all his money.

1939
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:33,745
So...

1940
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:36,333
I thought we should talk.

1941
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:39,543
I feel like maybe things
have gone too far.

1942
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:43,878
I mean, my mom's taking out a loan
against the house to help me pay Nora.

1943
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:45,208
I thought I paid Nora.

1944
01:32:45,291 --> 01:32:47,001
You pay 30 percent of Nora.

1945
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:49,625
Well, I'm going broke too,
if that's any help.

1946
01:32:49,791 --> 01:32:51,791
I've just agreed
to direct two shitty plays,

1947
01:32:51,875 --> 01:32:54,165
and we can forget putting anything away
for Henry's college.

1948
01:32:54,666 --> 01:32:58,126
It's just that up until now, we've been
able to keep Henry somewhat removed,

1949
01:32:58,208 --> 01:32:59,418
and this will change that.

1950
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:01,918
We have to protect him.

1951
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:02,920
I agree.

1952
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,290
Nora says that the evaluator
will come into our homes,

1953
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,995
they're gonna interview Henry
in addition to us,

1954
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:12,133
our friends, family, enemies,

1955
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:15,498
and then they'll observe us with him,
how we are as parents.

1956
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:17,173
- Sounds awful.
- I know.

1957
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:21,076
I feel like if anybody observed me on any
given day as a mom, I'd never get custody.

1958
01:33:23,541 --> 01:33:24,461
That was a joke.

1959
01:33:25,125 --> 01:33:27,285
- I know. I feel the same way.
- Right.

1960
01:33:27,375 --> 01:33:28,285
So...

1961
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:31,880
Maybe we can figure
something out between us.

1962
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:34,535
You remember I said this to you
at the beginning?

1963
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:36,825
I know you did,
but these are different circumstances.

1964
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:38,746
I was anticipating these circumstances.

1965
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:41,535
Anyway, shall we try this?

1966
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:42,455
Okay.

1967
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:58,125
I don't know how to start.

1968
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:03,126
Do you understand why I wanna stay in LA?

1969
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:04,038
No.

1970
01:34:04,166 --> 01:34:05,496
Well... that's not...

1971
01:34:05,583 --> 01:34:08,133
Charlie, that's not a useful way
for us to start.

1972
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:09,288
I don't understand it.

1973
01:34:11,208 --> 01:34:13,998
You don't remember promising
that we could do time here?

1974
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:15,133
We discussed things.

1975
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,040
We were married, we said things.

1976
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:18,745
We talked about moving to Europe.

1977
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:20,043
About getting a...

1978
01:34:21,166 --> 01:34:23,326
sideboard or what do you call it?

1979
01:34:23,416 --> 01:34:25,956
A credenza, to fill the empty space
behind the couch.

1980
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,171
We never did any of it.

1981
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:29,040
You turned down
the residency at the Geffen

1982
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:31,205
that would've brought us here for a year.

1983
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:32,631
It wasn't something I wanted.

1984
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:35,458
We had a great theater company
and a great life where we were.

1985
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:37,001
You call that a great life?

1986
01:34:37,083 --> 01:34:38,083
You know what I mean.

1987
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:40,876
I don't mean we had a great marriage.
I mean life in Brooklyn.

1988
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:42,670
Professionally.

1989
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:45,793
I don't know. Honestly,
I never considered anything different.

1990
01:34:45,875 --> 01:34:47,535
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

1991
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:50,575
I mean, I was your wife.
You should've considered my happiness too.

1992
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:54,326
Come on, you were happy.
You've just decided you weren't now.

1993
01:34:55,708 --> 01:34:56,708
Okay.

1994
01:34:58,041 --> 01:34:59,001
Let's...

1995
01:34:59,666 --> 01:35:02,496
My work is here now, my family is here.

1996
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:05,463
And I agreed to put Henry in school here
because your show went to series.

1997
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:08,751
I did that knowing that when you were done
shooting, he would come back to New York.

1998
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:09,673
Honey, we never said that.

1999
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:12,080
That may have been your assumption,
but we never said that.

2000
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:13,206
We did say it.

2001
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:14,881
When did we say it?

2002
01:35:14,958 --> 01:35:17,288
I don't know when we said it,
but we said it.

2003
01:35:17,375 --> 01:35:20,245
- We said it that time on the phone!
- Honey, let me finish. Sorry.

2004
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:21,633
I keeps saying that.

2005
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:24,668
I thought that if Henry was happy here,

2006
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:27,500
and my show continued,
that we might do LA for a while.

2007
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:29,793
I was not privy to that thought process.

2008
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:33,293
The only reason we didn't live here
is because you can't imagine desires

2009
01:35:33,375 --> 01:35:35,825
other than your own,
unless they're forced on you.

2010
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:38,876
Okay, you wish you hadn't married me,
you wish you'd had a different life,

2011
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:40,208
but this is what happened.

2012
01:35:41,416 --> 01:35:42,876
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

2013
01:35:45,083 --> 01:35:46,963
Nora says
there's no coming back from this.

2014
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:47,921
Fuck Nora!

2015
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,580
I hate fucking Nora telling me
I always lived in LA

2016
01:35:50,666 --> 01:35:52,416
even though I never lived in LA.

2017
01:35:53,333 --> 01:35:55,253
How could you have her
say those things about me?

2018
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,003
Jay said them about me too.

2019
01:35:57,666 --> 01:35:59,036
You shouldn't have fired Bert.

2020
01:35:59,125 --> 01:36:00,375
I needed my own asshole.

2021
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,040
Let's just both agree both of our lawyers
said shitty stuff about both of us.

2022
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:07,125
Nora was worse.

2023
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:08,915
Jay called me an alcoholic.

2024
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,630
You pulled the rug out from under me
and you're putting me through hell.

2025
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:13,418
You put me through hell
during our marriage.

2026
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,750
Oh, is that what that was, hell?

2027
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:16,713
Now you'll put Henry
through this horrible thing

2028
01:36:16,791 --> 01:36:18,381
so you can yet again get what you want!

2029
01:36:18,458 --> 01:36:21,828
It's not what I want. I mean,
it's what I want, but it's what was...

2030
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:23,670
was...

2031
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:24,880
what's best for him.

2032
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:27,168
Oh, well, I was wondering when you'd
get around to Henry

2033
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:28,500
and what he actually wants.

2034
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:29,543
Fuck off!

2035
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:30,955
No, you fuck off!

2036
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:33,001
If you'd listen to your son, or anyone,

2037
01:36:33,083 --> 01:36:34,753
then he'd tell you
that he'd rather live here!

2038
01:36:34,833 --> 01:36:36,633
Stop putting your feelings about me
onto Henry.

2039
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:38,248
He tells me he likes it better here.

2040
01:36:38,333 --> 01:36:40,423
He tells you because he knows
it's what you wanna hear!

2041
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,250
He tells me you're on the phone all
the time. You don't even play with him.

2042
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:46,463
Because I'm going through a divorce in LA
and trying to direct a play in New York!

2043
01:36:46,541 --> 01:36:49,791
Which closed because I wasn't there.
It was a huge opportunity...

2044
01:36:49,875 --> 01:36:51,535
Fighting for something
you don't even want!

2045
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:54,713
You're being so much like your father.

2046
01:36:55,708 --> 01:36:57,038
Do not compare me to my father!

2047
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:59,535
I didn't compare you to him.
I said you were acting like him.

2048
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:00,875
You're exactly like your mother.

2049
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:02,628
Everything you were complaining about her,
you're doing.

2050
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:04,078
You're suffocating Henry.

2051
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:06,376
First of all, I love my mother.
She was wonderful mother.

2052
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:07,708
I'm just repeating what you told me.

2053
01:37:07,791 --> 01:37:11,251
Secondly, how dare you
compare my mothering to my mother!

2054
01:37:11,333 --> 01:37:14,253
I may be like my father,
but I am not like my mother!

2055
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:17,043
You are! And you're like my father!

2056
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:18,535
You're also like my mother!

2057
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:20,745
You're all the bad things
about all of these people!

2058
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:22,458
But mostly your mother.

2059
01:37:22,541 --> 01:37:24,881
When we'd lie in bed together,
sometimes I would look at you

2060
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:26,668
and see her and just feel so gross!

2061
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:29,460
- I felt repulsed when you touched me!
- You're a slob.

2062
01:37:29,541 --> 01:37:32,381
- I made the beds, closed cabinets...
- The thought of having sex with you...

2063
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,540
makes me wanna peel my skin off.

2064
01:37:34,625 --> 01:37:36,995
You'll never be happy, in LA or anywhere.

2065
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:39,633
You'll think you found
some better opposite guy than me,

2066
01:37:39,708 --> 01:37:42,078
and in a few years,
you'll rebel against him

2067
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:45,206
because you need to have your voice,
but you don't want a voice.

2068
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:47,581
You just wanna fucking complain
about not having a voice!

2069
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:50,916
I think about being married to you,
and that woman is a stranger to me.

2070
01:37:51,458 --> 01:37:53,918
- I mean, we had a child's marriage.
- You've regressed.

2071
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,630
You've gone back to your life
before you met me, it's pathetic.

2072
01:37:56,708 --> 01:38:00,668
People used to tell me that you were
too selfish to be a great artist.

2073
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,380
And I used to defend you.

2074
01:38:02,458 --> 01:38:03,828
They were absolutely right.

2075
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:06,626
All your best acting is behind you.
You're back to being a hack!

2076
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:09,878
You gaslighted me!
You're a fucking villain!

2077
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:13,418
You want to present yourself as a victim
because it's a good legal strategy?

2078
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,130
Fine, but you and I both know

2079
01:38:15,208 --> 01:38:16,578
you chose this life!

2080
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:19,128
You wanted it until you didn't!

2081
01:38:20,166 --> 01:38:22,286
You used me so you could get out of LA.

2082
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:23,415
I didn't use you.

2083
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,790
You did and then you blamed me for it!

2084
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:28,423
You always made me aware
of what I was doing wrong,

2085
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,790
how I was falling short!

2086
01:38:29,875 --> 01:38:31,575
Life with you was joyless!

2087
01:38:31,666 --> 01:38:34,206
What, so then you had to go
and fuck someone else?

2088
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:35,881
You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her!

2089
01:38:35,958 --> 01:38:37,828
You should be upset
that I had a laugh with her!

2090
01:38:37,916 --> 01:38:38,746
Do you love her?

2091
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:40,173
No.

2092
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,460
But she didn't hate me.

2093
01:38:41,541 --> 01:38:42,631
You hated me.

2094
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:43,918
You hated me.

2095
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,630
You fucked somebody we worked with.

2096
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:48,168
You stopped having sex with me
in the last year.

2097
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,750
I never cheated on you.

2098
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:50,923
That was cheating on me!

2099
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,040
But there was so much I could have done.

2100
01:38:53,125 --> 01:38:55,825
I was a director in my 20s
who came from nothing

2101
01:38:55,916 --> 01:38:58,996
and was suddenly on the cover
of fucking Time Out New York!

2102
01:38:59,083 --> 01:39:01,963
I was hot shit and I wanted
to fuck everybody and I didn't.

2103
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:04,381
And I loved you
and I didn't wanna lose you.

2104
01:39:04,458 --> 01:39:07,288
But I'm in my 20s
and I didn't wanna lose that too,

2105
01:39:07,375 --> 01:39:08,825
and I kinda did!

2106
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:11,748
And you wanted so much so fast.

2107
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:13,543
I didn't even wanna get married.

2108
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:15,075
I mean, fuck it!

2109
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,290
There's so much I didn't do.

2110
01:39:18,041 --> 01:39:19,921
- Thanks for that!
- You're welcome!

2111
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,250
I can't believe
I have to know you forever!

2112
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:25,333
Oh, you're fucking insane!

2113
01:39:26,083 --> 01:39:28,333
And you're fucking winning!

2114
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,540
Are you kidding me?

2115
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:32,748
I wanted to be married.

2116
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:34,625
I'd already lost!

2117
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:37,415
You didn't love me as much as I loved you!

2118
01:39:39,416 --> 01:39:40,956
What does that have to do with LA?

2119
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:44,131
What?

2120
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:47,708
You're so merged
with your own selfishness,

2121
01:39:47,791 --> 01:39:50,921
you don't even identify it
as selfishness anymore!

2122
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:53,460
You're such a dick!

2123
01:39:53,541 --> 01:39:56,331
Every day I wake up
and I hope you're dead!

2124
01:39:56,416 --> 01:39:59,376
Dead like... if I could guarantee
Henry would be okay,

2125
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:00,998
I'd hope you'd get an illness

2126
01:40:01,083 --> 01:40:03,213
and then get hit by a car and die!

2127
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:25,043
Oh, God!

2128
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:35,793
I'm sorry.

2129
01:40:37,708 --> 01:40:38,668
Me too.

2130
01:41:05,083 --> 01:41:06,883
Okay, no, we can make this nice.

2131
01:41:08,041 --> 01:41:10,751
I would take the smaller plants
and put them by the window.

2132
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:13,325
And do you have things
we can put on the walls?

2133
01:41:33,916 --> 01:41:35,746
All right, that's it. Thank you very much.

2134
01:41:35,833 --> 01:41:39,423
We miss you and it looks great, really.
Let us know how it goes, okay?

2135
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,920
All right. I'll see you guys on Monday.

2136
01:41:42,333 --> 01:41:44,423
- Love you.
- All right, love you too. Bye.

2137
01:42:09,458 --> 01:42:11,708
Why do we have so many plants
all of a sudden?

2138
01:42:11,791 --> 01:42:14,001
We'll have to return some of that stuff,
so don't get used to it.

2139
01:42:14,083 --> 01:42:16,293
I find plants kind of scary.

2140
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:17,495
These plants are good guys.

2141
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:20,330
Hey, come here.

2142
01:42:22,916 --> 01:42:23,786
Yeah?

2143
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:27,290
Tomorrow, this woman is going to come

2144
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:28,705
and visit us...

2145
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,960
and be with us while we eat dinner.

2146
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:34,625
- Is it your girlfriend?
- No.

2147
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:37,418
- Is it Mommy's boyfriend?
- No. Why? Does Mommy have a boyfriend?

2148
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,580
I don't know. Does she?

2149
01:42:39,666 --> 01:42:40,626
I don't know.

2150
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:42,080
I don't know.

2151
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,130
Why is someone watching us eat dinner?

2152
01:42:45,208 --> 01:42:46,578
I know, it's weird.

2153
01:42:47,375 --> 01:42:48,955
It's just something we have to do.

2154
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,000
Which has to do with...

2155
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:53,753
Mommy and me figuring out everything...

2156
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:55,960
and how we're gonna be.

2157
01:42:58,791 --> 01:42:59,631
You know?

2158
01:43:00,916 --> 01:43:02,126
Will you read to me?

2159
01:43:03,291 --> 01:43:04,501
Sure. Grab your book.

2160
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:07,075
Do you use drugs or alcohol?

2161
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:08,875
I drink alcohol.

2162
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,920
How much alcohol do you drink?

2163
01:43:13,833 --> 01:43:15,793
I don't know, glass of wine with dinner.

2164
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:17,210
Sometimes more.

2165
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:18,251
How much more?

2166
01:43:20,083 --> 01:43:21,793
It's... Sometimes a...

2167
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:23,288
few...

2168
01:43:23,958 --> 01:43:27,378
I... sometimes split a bottle of wine
with someone.

2169
01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:29,328
- Okay, who do you split it with?
- I mean...

2170
01:43:29,416 --> 01:43:33,076
if I'm having dinner with someone
and we order a bottle of wine.

2171
01:43:33,166 --> 01:43:34,996
- Okay.
- You know, like at a restaurant.

2172
01:43:35,416 --> 01:43:39,246
When you say, "Do you wanna go
by the glass or do we get a bottle?"

2173
01:43:40,166 --> 01:43:41,126
You get a bottle?

2174
01:43:41,708 --> 01:43:42,918
Well, sometimes.

2175
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:46,540
But... I mean,
sometimes I go by the glass.

2176
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:48,420
You know, it depends.

2177
01:43:52,916 --> 01:43:55,996
Did you mean drugs ever?
I have done drugs.

2178
01:43:57,458 --> 01:43:58,458
In college.

2179
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:01,825
- Anything since you've been...
- I don't do it regularly.

2180
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:03,791
Anything since you've been a mother?

2181
01:44:06,375 --> 01:44:07,665
Pot a few times.

2182
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:11,670
Coke once at a party.
Henry wasn't with me.

2183
01:44:14,208 --> 01:44:17,168
What would you say
are your strengths as a parent?

2184
01:44:25,333 --> 01:44:26,293
I listen.

2185
01:44:27,708 --> 01:44:28,578
I play.

2186
01:44:31,041 --> 01:44:33,581
I put in the time. I...

2187
01:44:34,291 --> 01:44:35,131
love...

2188
01:44:36,166 --> 01:44:37,746
taking care of him...

2189
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:40,040
watching him grow.

2190
01:44:42,166 --> 01:44:43,206
And sometimes...

2191
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:47,461
what they say about "it goes so fast"
is true, but...

2192
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:50,131
sometimes it's not.

2193
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:53,211
Sometimes it goes too slow, honestly.

2194
01:44:54,541 --> 01:44:55,921
What are your weaknesses?

2195
01:44:59,083 --> 01:45:00,583
I'm too precise.

2196
01:45:00,666 --> 01:45:01,746
I care too much.

2197
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:03,753
Are those weaknesses?

2198
01:45:06,458 --> 01:45:07,418
Maybe not.

2199
01:45:10,583 --> 01:45:13,133
You know, he can be an asshole and...

2200
01:45:14,041 --> 01:45:16,671
I can get really pissed off
and I'll call him on being an asshole...

2201
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:18,000
I'm gonna stop you there.

2202
01:45:18,458 --> 01:45:20,578
When you do this for real,
don't ever say that.

2203
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:22,826
People don't accept mothers
who drink too much wine

2204
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:24,996
and yell at their child
and call him an asshole.

2205
01:45:25,083 --> 01:45:26,503
I get it. I do it too.

2206
01:45:27,208 --> 01:45:29,328
We can accept an imperfect dad.

2207
01:45:29,416 --> 01:45:33,666
Let's face it, the idea of a good father
was only invented like 30 years ago.

2208
01:45:34,333 --> 01:45:37,213
Before that,
fathers were expected to be silent

2209
01:45:37,291 --> 01:45:41,211
and absent and unreliable and selfish,

2210
01:45:41,291 --> 01:45:43,381
and can all say
we want them to be different.

2211
01:45:44,125 --> 01:45:47,125
But on some basic level, we accept them.

2212
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:49,208
We love them for their fallibilities,

2213
01:45:49,291 --> 01:45:53,171
but people absolutely don't accept
those same failings in mothers.

2214
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:56,290
We don't accept it structurally
and we don't accept it spiritually.

2215
01:45:56,375 --> 01:45:59,995
Because the basis
of our Judeo-Christian whatever

2216
01:46:00,083 --> 01:46:02,173
is Mary, Mother of Jesus,

2217
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:03,750
and she's perfect.

2218
01:46:03,833 --> 01:46:06,383
She's a virgin who gives birth,

2219
01:46:06,916 --> 01:46:09,166
unwaveringly supports her child

2220
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:11,460
and holds his dead body when he's gone.

2221
01:46:12,041 --> 01:46:15,081
And the dad isn't there.
He didn't even do the fucking.

2222
01:46:15,166 --> 01:46:16,206
God is in Heaven.

2223
01:46:17,375 --> 01:46:19,285
God is the father

2224
01:46:19,375 --> 01:46:21,245
and God didn't show up.

2225
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:25,583
So you have to be perfect and Charlie
can be a fuck up and it doesn't matter.

2226
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:29,960
You will always be held
to a different higher standard.

2227
01:46:30,375 --> 01:46:33,495
And it's fucked up,
but that is the way it is.

2228
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:04,083
I think I rang the wrong bell. Nancy Katz.

2229
01:47:04,166 --> 01:47:05,326
Hi. I'm Charlie Barber.

2230
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,540
Henry's just playing in his room.

2231
01:47:09,208 --> 01:47:10,378
Nancy, can I get you anything?

2232
01:47:11,166 --> 01:47:13,626
I'm easy. A glass of water?

2233
01:47:22,875 --> 01:47:24,075
It's a new apartment.

2234
01:47:31,041 --> 01:47:32,331
Shall we go in here?

2235
01:47:32,416 --> 01:47:33,246
Sure.

2236
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:53,328
What's a day like for the two of you here?

2237
01:47:53,958 --> 01:47:56,378
Well, if he has school,
I take him there, of course,

2238
01:47:56,458 --> 01:47:58,328
and pick him up, assuming I can do both.

2239
01:47:58,666 --> 01:48:00,626
What prevents you from picking him up?

2240
01:48:02,458 --> 01:48:03,628
You know, work.

2241
01:48:03,708 --> 01:48:05,668
I'm preparing a play
I'm directing in a few months.

2242
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:07,495
Oh, what is that?

2243
01:48:07,708 --> 01:48:10,628
Kasimir and Karoline by Ödön von Horváth.

2244
01:48:10,708 --> 01:48:12,538
We're doing it at the Barrow in New York.

2245
01:48:12,625 --> 01:48:14,125
So you have to be away?

2246
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:17,418
Yes, recently, since Nicole's
been working on the show in LA,

2247
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:18,920
I come back and forth a lot.

2248
01:48:19,375 --> 01:48:21,035
- That sounds difficult.
- It is.

2249
01:48:22,083 --> 01:48:23,083
And expensive.

2250
01:48:23,166 --> 01:48:24,996
I'll try to take him
with me some of the time,

2251
01:48:25,083 --> 01:48:27,043
but Nicole doesn't like for him
to fly so much.

2252
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:30,455
Well, that can be hard on the child,
all that recycled air.

2253
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:33,920
Well, he's sturdy.

2254
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:38,710
Some parents won't take their kids to
a restaurant because of these superbugs.

2255
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:45,326
I noticed on one visit to Los Angeles,

2256
01:48:45,416 --> 01:48:46,496
you came on a Sunday

2257
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:48,043
and left on a Thursday.

2258
01:48:48,125 --> 01:48:49,875
Why not stay for a weekend?

2259
01:48:50,375 --> 01:48:51,325
Oh...

2260
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:55,380
that time I had tech
for Electra in New York.

2261
01:48:55,833 --> 01:48:56,963
What's that?

2262
01:48:57,875 --> 01:48:59,915
It was my Broadway debut.

2263
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,040
Oh, I don't know what "tech" is.

2264
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:05,575
It's the technical part of the production.
You figure out the lights.

2265
01:49:05,666 --> 01:49:07,876
- And Monday's our day off in the theater.
- What's a weekend day like?

2266
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:10,628
Well, out here, he has basketball
on Saturday at 12:00.

2267
01:49:10,708 --> 01:49:11,828
Eleven, I'm sorry.

2268
01:49:11,916 --> 01:49:14,206
So we go there, and then afterwards...

2269
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:18,540
maybe we'll get lunch somewhere
and then if there's a movie to see...

2270
01:49:19,041 --> 01:49:20,541
Does he like basketball?

2271
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:21,880
He does.

2272
01:49:21,958 --> 01:49:25,248
His coach, Rick, says
he's a good dribbler, and I've seen that.

2273
01:49:25,708 --> 01:49:26,918
- Uh-huh.
- Ron.

2274
01:49:27,791 --> 01:49:29,671
Sorry, his coach's name is Ron.

2275
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:31,330
Rick's his dentist in New York.

2276
01:49:31,416 --> 01:49:34,536
Well, you know our home home was...
is in New York.

2277
01:49:34,625 --> 01:49:35,915
That's where we live.

2278
01:49:36,041 --> 01:49:38,171
New York is a long way from here.

2279
01:49:38,666 --> 01:49:40,456
Well, we like it because we can walk.

2280
01:49:40,541 --> 01:49:42,081
You can walk here.

2281
01:49:42,458 --> 01:49:43,418
Not really.

2282
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,830
And the space...

2283
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:52,670
Do you like your school?

2284
01:49:53,666 --> 01:49:54,496
I love it.

2285
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:56,708
What's your favorite part about it?

2286
01:49:57,541 --> 01:49:58,631
I don't know.

2287
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:00,881
Maybe gym.

2288
01:50:01,291 --> 01:50:02,421
You like math.

2289
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:04,830
Not anymore.

2290
01:50:06,666 --> 01:50:07,956
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

2291
01:50:08,041 --> 01:50:09,541
But you're getting really good at it.

2292
01:50:09,625 --> 01:50:10,455
No.

2293
01:50:11,541 --> 01:50:13,131
Well, you are, but...

2294
01:50:15,666 --> 01:50:18,036
What do you
and your dad like to do together?

2295
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:21,415
When I'm at my dad's,
we sometimes watch a movie

2296
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:23,000
or build a Lego or something.

2297
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:25,671
My dad's a great Lego builder.

2298
01:50:26,083 --> 01:50:27,383
And at your mom's?

2299
01:50:28,166 --> 01:50:30,536
At home, I have most of my toys,

2300
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:34,125
and there's a pool
and I have a tree house and jungle gym.

2301
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:37,785
We have super secret treasure hunt,

2302
01:50:37,875 --> 01:50:39,285
which is really fun.

2303
01:50:40,833 --> 01:50:44,333
- Sweetheart?
- Army men ride in here and...

2304
01:50:44,416 --> 01:50:45,916
Wanna help me set the table?

2305
01:50:46,375 --> 01:50:47,535
Do I have to?

2306
01:50:47,625 --> 01:50:50,075
- Just come in here and grab a plate.
- I'm playing.

2307
01:50:50,166 --> 01:50:50,996
Henry?

2308
01:50:52,041 --> 01:50:53,631
Okay.

2309
01:50:54,416 --> 01:50:55,376
Fine.

2310
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:01,288
- Why are you being like this?
- What?

2311
01:51:01,625 --> 01:51:03,245
If I ask you to help out, help out.

2312
01:51:03,333 --> 01:51:05,753
- What is this?
- A special meal.

2313
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:07,955
What are the green things?

2314
01:51:08,333 --> 01:51:10,463
There aren't green things
in a special meal.

2315
01:51:10,541 --> 01:51:11,671
It's just the garnish.

2316
01:51:12,833 --> 01:51:13,753
I'll take it off.

2317
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:16,880
I don't wanna eat anything it touched.

2318
01:51:16,958 --> 01:51:20,538
- Doesn't change the taste of anything.
- I might wanna be a vegetarian.

2319
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:22,460
Mom's a vegetarian.

2320
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:23,921
Is she a vegetarian now?

2321
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,290
- Yeah.
- Well, then you should like garnish.

2322
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:28,245
It's all garnish, vegetarianism.

2323
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:31,673
I'm done with my water.

2324
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:43,130
Sure I can't get you anything?

2325
01:51:43,208 --> 01:51:44,918
No, I'm fine, thank you.

2326
01:51:47,458 --> 01:51:48,918
Do the thing with the knife.

2327
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,750
No, I'm not...

2328
01:51:51,708 --> 01:51:52,538
No.

2329
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,540
Come on.

2330
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:55,923
It's not a dinner thing.

2331
01:51:59,041 --> 01:52:00,461
It's not an any time thing.

2332
01:52:00,958 --> 01:52:02,578
What's the thing with the knife?

2333
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:04,708
It's hilarious.

2334
01:52:04,791 --> 01:52:07,251
No, it's dumb.
I have a small knife on my keychain.

2335
01:52:07,333 --> 01:52:08,633
Which is only for adults.

2336
01:52:10,291 --> 01:52:11,751
I do a thing with it sometimes.

2337
01:52:13,541 --> 01:52:15,131
You said I could get a knife.

2338
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:17,375
A jackknife, yeah, when you're older.

2339
01:52:18,166 --> 01:52:19,076
Like ten.

2340
01:52:19,625 --> 01:52:21,035
No, like 20.

2341
01:52:21,666 --> 01:52:22,496
Yeah.

2342
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,380
Dime, rime, lime, pime, sime...

2343
01:52:32,458 --> 01:52:34,458
Honey, stop guessing.
You're so close. Stay with it.

2344
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:36,711
Well, I don't wanna do it.

2345
01:52:36,791 --> 01:52:38,041
What's the first letter?

2346
01:52:38,125 --> 01:52:40,205
I don't wanna do it.
Can I do the iPad?

2347
01:52:40,291 --> 01:52:41,751
No, look. What's the first letter?

2348
01:52:42,208 --> 01:52:44,378
- I don't want to.
- It's a T. What sound does T make?

2349
01:52:44,458 --> 01:52:46,668
- Tuh.
- Right. Then just do the rest of it.

2350
01:52:47,333 --> 01:52:48,293
Dime.

2351
01:52:49,208 --> 01:52:50,038
No.

2352
01:52:50,125 --> 01:52:52,415
You have "tuh" and "ime." What is that?

2353
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:56,583
Time.

2354
01:52:57,083 --> 01:52:57,923
It's "time."

2355
01:52:59,291 --> 01:53:00,251
It's "time."

2356
01:53:05,375 --> 01:53:07,535
You'll see, honey.
One day it's just gonna click

2357
01:53:07,625 --> 01:53:08,915
and you'll be able to read everything.

2358
01:53:10,375 --> 01:53:11,575
I need a break.

2359
01:53:11,958 --> 01:53:13,748
Can I go play in my room?

2360
01:53:13,833 --> 01:53:14,673
Sure.

2361
01:53:17,041 --> 01:53:17,921
Hey.

2362
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:21,038
Yeah?

2363
01:53:38,708 --> 01:53:40,418
Do you ever observe married people?

2364
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:41,710
No. Why would I?

2365
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,040
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

2366
01:53:55,750 --> 01:53:57,000
The knife thing is...

2367
01:53:57,250 --> 01:53:59,170
I carry this knife on my keychain,

2368
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:00,790
which his mother got me actually.

2369
01:54:02,541 --> 01:54:05,081
And I do this thing for his mom
where I pretend to cut myself,

2370
01:54:05,166 --> 01:54:07,576
but I retract the blade,
but I don't do it with him.

2371
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:11,881
Oh.

2372
01:54:13,333 --> 01:54:14,793
- That's fine.
- Are you okay?

2373
01:54:14,875 --> 01:54:17,285
Yeah, I must not have retracted
the blade all the way.

2374
01:54:17,375 --> 01:54:18,205
- Do you need...
- Yeah.

2375
01:54:20,208 --> 01:54:22,378
Yeah, no, it's fine.

2376
01:54:22,833 --> 01:54:24,083
What else can I tell you?

2377
01:54:25,333 --> 01:54:26,673
I think I have enough.

2378
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:27,790
You have enough?

2379
01:54:28,375 --> 01:54:30,995
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Totally. I'm fine.

2380
01:54:32,125 --> 01:54:34,625
Well, I'll leave you guys for tonight.

2381
01:54:35,125 --> 01:54:36,075
Oh, okay.

2382
01:54:37,041 --> 01:54:40,041
I'll be in touch
if I have further questions.

2383
01:54:41,791 --> 01:54:43,041
Oh, thanks.

2384
01:54:44,833 --> 01:54:46,003
Oh, thanks.

2385
01:54:49,083 --> 01:54:51,213
Thanks. Thank you for the water.

2386
01:54:51,291 --> 01:54:53,831
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Are you sure you're okay?

2387
01:54:53,916 --> 01:54:55,286
- Yeah.
- Okay.

2388
01:54:56,208 --> 01:54:57,458
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

2389
01:55:02,416 --> 01:55:03,826
Oh. Sorry.

2390
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:06,420
All right, let...

2391
01:55:09,208 --> 01:55:10,578
I think you turn the...

2392
01:55:14,916 --> 01:55:16,036
Sorry.

2393
01:55:16,125 --> 01:55:16,955
Okay.

2394
01:56:20,541 --> 01:56:21,751
Dad, are you okay?

2395
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:23,830
Yeah, I'm just tired.

2396
01:56:41,041 --> 01:56:42,581
Dad, did she like us?

2397
01:56:44,708 --> 01:56:47,168
Yeah, she thought we were great.

2398
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:21,538
- Come on.
- Guys, slow down.

2399
01:58:23,208 --> 01:58:24,418
So...

2400
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:26,880
because Charlie dropped his claim
to New York,

2401
01:58:26,958 --> 01:58:28,208
we're mostly done.

2402
01:58:28,291 --> 01:58:32,001
Jay's lost interest,
Ted, his associate's, doing the paperwork.

2403
01:58:32,083 --> 01:58:33,923
And we're not taking any money, right?

2404
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,080
We withdrew our claim for the MacArthur,

2405
01:58:36,166 --> 01:58:37,996
which I think
we could have gotten, by the way,

2406
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:40,666
and they're not asking
for any of the show.

2407
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:43,210
Thank you for everything, Nora.

2408
01:58:43,708 --> 01:58:44,918
You're welcome, doll.

2409
01:58:45,916 --> 01:58:47,626
To your new home in LA.

2410
01:58:52,916 --> 01:58:55,376
And whenever Charlie is in LA,

2411
01:58:55,458 --> 01:58:58,418
I got the custody breakdown to be 55/45.

2412
01:58:58,833 --> 01:59:01,673
So you'll have Henry an extra day
every two weeks.

2413
01:59:02,208 --> 01:59:03,538
I thought we made an equal.

2414
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:05,540
I tweaked it at the last minute.

2415
01:59:05,625 --> 01:59:08,375
I just didn't want him
to be able to say he got 50/50,

2416
01:59:08,458 --> 01:59:09,878
bragging to his friends.

2417
01:59:10,375 --> 01:59:12,415
- But I don't wanna do that.
- Take it.

2418
01:59:12,833 --> 01:59:14,253
You won.

2419
01:59:40,291 --> 01:59:42,581
Hi. You look like a guy
who really cares about animals.

2420
01:59:42,666 --> 01:59:43,496
Nope.

2421
02:00:03,541 --> 02:00:04,881
Oh, my God!

2422
02:00:05,375 --> 02:00:06,205
- Hey.
- Hi.

2423
02:00:16,041 --> 02:00:17,381
You hear some guy screaming?

2424
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:24,210
The couch was technically hers,
pre-marriage.

2425
02:00:24,291 --> 02:00:26,421
But, I mean, it was our couch.

2426
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:27,960
It's not like
I was gonna buy another couch.

2427
02:00:28,041 --> 02:00:30,331
But then when it comes time to split,
it's suddenly her couch.

2428
02:00:30,416 --> 02:00:31,826
And I have no couch and...

2429
02:00:34,875 --> 02:00:36,995
I'm sitting on the floor
is the short version.

2430
02:00:39,666 --> 02:00:42,496
I'm sorry.
This is all so self-pitying and boring.

2431
02:00:42,583 --> 02:00:43,503
No, come on.

2432
02:00:43,583 --> 02:00:45,463
No, I'm so stupid. I'm sorry.

2433
02:00:45,541 --> 02:00:47,881
- Sounds really tough.
- No, it is sad.

2434
02:04:08,833 --> 02:04:09,673
Hello?

2435
02:04:19,958 --> 02:04:20,788
Hello?

2436
02:04:22,916 --> 02:04:24,956
Hi, sorry, the door was open.

2437
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:27,211
Oh. Okay.

2438
02:04:29,291 --> 02:04:30,501
Whoa! Gotcha!

2439
02:04:32,583 --> 02:04:35,043
Charlie, oh!

2440
02:04:35,125 --> 02:04:36,665
Was your flight okay?

2441
02:04:36,750 --> 02:04:38,130
- Yeah.
- Carter.

2442
02:04:38,208 --> 02:04:39,288
Charlie.

2443
02:04:39,375 --> 02:04:40,415
Nicole's still at work.

2444
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,330
- Hi.
- Hi.

2445
02:04:49,416 --> 02:04:50,326
Can I I get a hug?

2446
02:04:55,583 --> 02:04:57,083
Hey, how'd it go?

2447
02:04:57,166 --> 02:04:57,996
Good, yeah.

2448
02:04:58,083 --> 02:05:00,383
And Donny's dead now.
I shot the scene where...

2449
02:05:00,458 --> 02:05:02,378
- Henry's upstairs.
- She got an Emmy nomination.

2450
02:05:02,916 --> 02:05:05,206
- She's a great actress.
- No, for directing.

2451
02:05:06,875 --> 02:05:08,705
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

2452
02:05:08,791 --> 02:05:11,211
Now I know what you were
so obsessed with all the time.

2453
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,580
- We should get ready.
- Yeah.

2454
02:05:13,666 --> 02:05:14,956
Oh, we're the Beatles.

2455
02:05:15,041 --> 02:05:17,081
- Come on, Charlie.
- I didn't get a costume together.

2456
02:05:17,166 --> 02:05:19,286
- You could be George Martin.
- I don't need to be anyone.

2457
02:05:19,375 --> 02:05:21,455
- You've gotta be something.
- A ghost. I'll get you a sheet.

2458
02:05:21,541 --> 02:05:23,671
I have the album cover
if anyone needs to reference it.

2459
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:25,250
And we should leave soon.

2460
02:05:25,333 --> 02:05:27,463
I'm saying that as much for me
as anyone else.

2461
02:05:27,541 --> 02:05:29,331
- Am I John or George?
- Trick-or-treating starts at 5:00.

2462
02:05:29,416 --> 02:05:30,996
You're George. Nicole is John.

2463
02:05:37,916 --> 02:05:40,876
I wanted to tell you
I took a residency at UCLA.

2464
02:05:42,416 --> 02:05:44,876
I'm gonna direct two plays
and rep at REDCAT.

2465
02:05:46,958 --> 02:05:47,788
Oh.

2466
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:49,921
So I'll be here for a while.

2467
02:05:53,583 --> 02:05:54,463
That's great.

2468
02:05:57,708 --> 02:05:58,628
Are you okay?

2469
02:06:01,250 --> 02:06:02,080
Yeah.

2470
02:06:04,666 --> 02:06:05,746
It's only good.

2471
02:06:06,541 --> 02:06:07,581
Nicole?

2472
02:06:07,666 --> 02:06:09,706
Can you help me with my zipper?

2473
02:06:30,166 --> 02:06:33,876
"Charlie is incr..." something.

2474
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:35,580
"Neat"

2475
02:06:35,666 --> 02:06:39,076
and I rely on him

2476
02:06:39,541 --> 02:06:43,921
to keep things in order.

2477
02:06:44,916 --> 02:06:46,916
"He is energy con..."

2478
02:06:48,041 --> 02:06:51,041
- I don't know what this word is.
- You're getting so good at reading.

2479
02:06:51,875 --> 02:06:52,995
What is that?

2480
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,500
"He doesn't look in the mirror too often."

2481
02:06:59,958 --> 02:07:02,168
He cries easily

2482
02:07:02,583 --> 02:07:04,543
in movies.

2483
02:07:05,791 --> 02:07:08,251
"He is very self-suf..."

2484
02:07:09,166 --> 02:07:10,206
Self-sufficient.

2485
02:07:11,791 --> 02:07:14,921
"He can darn a sock..."

2486
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,420
That means sew, like a hole.

2487
02:07:18,083 --> 02:07:21,253
"And cook himself dinner

2488
02:07:21,666 --> 02:07:24,456
and ur..."

2489
02:07:24,541 --> 02:07:25,671
Break it into two parts.

2490
02:07:26,083 --> 02:07:27,883
"Ur on."

2491
02:07:27,958 --> 02:07:29,828
Not "ur" but "ire."

2492
02:07:29,916 --> 02:07:30,996
Ire. on.

2493
02:07:31,083 --> 02:07:32,003
Iron.

2494
02:07:33,833 --> 02:07:35,083
"A shirt."

2495
02:07:36,958 --> 02:07:40,288
He rarely gets defeated

2496
02:07:40,583 --> 02:07:43,003
which I fell...

2497
02:07:44,291 --> 02:07:47,631
feel like I always do.

2498
02:07:48,833 --> 02:07:52,133
Charlie takes all of my moods steadily.

2499
02:07:52,708 --> 02:07:54,958
He doesn't give in to them

2500
02:07:55,208 --> 02:07:57,628
or make me feel bad about them.

2501
02:07:58,458 --> 02:08:00,788
"He's a great dresser
and never looks em..."

2502
02:08:01,291 --> 02:08:03,381
- I don't know this one.
- Embarrassing.

2503
02:08:04,208 --> 02:08:05,248
"Embarrassing,

2504
02:08:05,666 --> 02:08:08,996
which is hard for a man."

2505
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,040
You read it now.

2506
02:08:13,333 --> 02:08:14,753
"He's very competitive."

2507
02:08:15,916 --> 02:08:17,626
He loves being a dad.

2508
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:20,960
He loves all the things
you're supposed to hate,

2509
02:08:21,416 --> 02:08:22,786
like the tantrums,

2510
02:08:23,416 --> 02:08:24,786
the waking up at night.

2511
02:08:25,375 --> 02:08:28,035
It's almost annoying
how much he likes it,

2512
02:08:28,375 --> 02:08:29,785
but then it's mostly nice.

2513
02:08:30,958 --> 02:08:32,878
He disappears into his own world.

2514
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
He and Henry are alike that way.

2515
02:08:36,666 --> 02:08:37,826
He can tell

2516
02:08:38,208 --> 02:08:40,998
people they have food in their teeth

2517
02:08:41,708 --> 02:08:44,538
or on their face in a way
that doesn't make them feel bad.

2518
02:08:45,583 --> 02:08:46,923
Charlie is self-made.

2519
02:08:47,291 --> 02:08:49,751
His parents, I only met them once,

2520
02:08:49,833 --> 02:08:52,583
but he told me
there was a lot of alcohol...

2521
02:08:56,250 --> 02:08:58,710
He moved to New York from Indiana

2522
02:08:59,291 --> 02:09:00,501
with no safety net,

2523
02:09:00,583 --> 02:09:03,213
and now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

2524
02:09:04,083 --> 02:09:07,043
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

2525
02:09:07,458 --> 02:09:08,788
With the theater company...

2526
02:09:09,666 --> 02:09:11,166
he casts a spell...

2527
02:09:11,791 --> 02:09:14,251
that made everyone feel included.

2528
02:09:14,791 --> 02:09:17,631
"No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant."

2529
02:09:18,958 --> 02:09:19,998
What's an intern?

2530
02:09:20,833 --> 02:09:21,923
It's like a...

2531
02:09:22,583 --> 02:09:24,333
helper, but who isn't paid.

2532
02:09:24,416 --> 02:09:25,666
Why aren't they paid?

2533
02:09:26,875 --> 02:09:28,575
They're young, they're learning.

2534
02:09:30,125 --> 02:09:32,665
I don't know, maybe if they do a good job,
they get paid later.

2535
02:09:33,208 --> 02:09:34,458
Okay, keep going.

2536
02:09:35,791 --> 02:09:39,671
"He could remember all the inside jokes,
he's extremely organized and thorough,"

2537
02:09:39,916 --> 02:09:43,286
he's very clear about what he wants,
unlike me who can't always tell.

2538
02:09:43,875 --> 02:09:46,915
I fell in love with him
two seconds after I saw him.

2539
02:10:10,625 --> 02:10:12,075
And I'll never stop loving him,

2540
02:10:12,541 --> 02:10:14,461
"even though
it doesn't make sense anymore."

2541
02:10:28,875 --> 02:10:30,455
See you. Good to see you again.

2542
02:10:30,541 --> 02:10:31,541
Good seeing you too.

2543
02:10:31,625 --> 02:10:33,205
- Oh, Charlie!
- G-ma.

2544
02:10:33,291 --> 02:10:34,791
I'm so happy you came.

2545
02:10:35,416 --> 02:10:36,956
I'll email you that article.

2546
02:10:37,041 --> 02:10:39,041
- Yes, please do. Thank you.
- Yeah.

2547
02:10:39,125 --> 02:10:40,075
Take care.

2548
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:47,040
We were gonna bring him to dinner,
but he's so wiped out.

2549
02:10:47,583 --> 02:10:48,673
You wanna take him?

2550
02:10:50,125 --> 02:10:52,125
- It's your night.
- I know.

2551
02:10:52,208 --> 02:10:53,288
- Yeah.
- Good.

2552
02:10:53,375 --> 02:10:54,575
- I'll drop him back in the morning.
- Yeah.

2553
02:10:54,666 --> 02:10:56,246
Text me when you're up.
We'll figure something out.

2554
02:10:56,333 --> 02:10:57,883
You're gonna go with your dad, okay?

2555
02:10:58,250 --> 02:10:59,500
- Okay.
- Yeah?

2556
02:11:11,416 --> 02:11:12,326
I love you.

2557
02:11:12,916 --> 02:11:14,036
I love you too.

2558
02:11:19,916 --> 02:11:20,746
Oh, hey.

2559
02:11:32,833 --> 02:11:33,883
Thanks.
