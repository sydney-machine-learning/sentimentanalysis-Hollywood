you find yourself,

Carl! Where you headed?

877
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:09,213
Combat Carl just heard
there's a birthday party...

878
00:38:09,313 --> 00:38:10,614
at the playground
on Main Street.

879
00:38:10,714 --> 00:38:12,480
Rumor has it
they got two pinatas.

880
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,968
- That could be 20 to 30 kids.
- Nice!

Uh, no,
I can't, sir.

885
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:26,080
Bo, I need to get
back to my kid.

886
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,878
- ALL: What?
- You got a kid?

887
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:28,675
Yeah.

00:38:28,745 --> 00:38:31,179
COMBAT CARL: Way to beat
the odds, soldier.

889
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,730
Meet you at the
playground, Peep.

890
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:35,314
Combat Carl's got
a pinata party to crash.

891
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:38,736
All right, move out.
Hut! Hut! Hut!

892
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:41,279
So, you're, uh,
with a kid?

893
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:42,514
It's not Andy, is it?

894
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:44,446
No, no, no.
He went off to college.

895
00:38:44,546 --> 00:38:46,414
But he gave us to Bonnie.

896
00:38:46,513 --> 00:38:48,413
- You have a little girl?
- No way!

897
00:38:48,513 --> 00:38:50,147
Yeah, yeah.
It's why I'm out here.

898
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:51,380
Her other toy is trapped

899
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,714
in this antique store,
and I have to...

900
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:54,647
Second Chance Antiques?

901
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:56,112
We know that store.

902

That's great.
That is great!

903

If you know the store,
you could really

904
00:38:59,346 --> 00:39:00,470
- help me find him...
- No way.

905
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:01,488
We wasted years there,

906
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:03,543
just sitting on the shelf,
collecting dust.

907
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:05,080
Oh, Bo, that's awful.

908
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,488
But I don't have a choice.

909
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,113
I have to get that toy
from Gabby.

910
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,887
Whoa. Steer clear
of that weirdo.

911
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:12,164
If I were you, I'd cut
my losses and go home.

912
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,347
But Bonnie needs him
to get through kindergarten.

913
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:16,752
Kids lose toys every day.
Bonnie will get over it.

914
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:17,908
No, no...

915
00:39:17,963 --> 00:39:21,905

just like Molly needed you.

I didn't know you had a kid.

920
00:39:28,668 --> 00:39:30,227
That was a long time ago.

921
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,981
Oh, Bo's kid was
something special.

922
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,647
She was the cutest thing...

923
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,681
but so afraid
of the dark.

924
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,213
It was just a phase.

925
00:39:38,313 --> 00:39:39,808
Oh, you weren't there
in the beginning.

926
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,547
Hearing Molly cry
each night...

927
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:44,260
it broke every
toy's heart.

928
00:39:44,513 --> 00:39:47,380
And then,
Bo came into the room.

929
00:39:47,604 --> 00:39:51,472
Her lamp was the only thing
that made Molly feel safe.

930
00:39:51,571 --> 00:39:53,434
Mom would let her
keep Bo on all night.

931
00:39:53,488 --> 00:39:55,571
Ha! Who knew you were
such a softy?

932
00:39:55,671 --> 00:39:56,806
And Molly would
fall asleep

933
00:39:56,905 --> 00:39:59,155
with her hand
resting on Bo's feet.

934
00:39:59,234 --> 00:40:01,605

I don't know.
Couple years.

1439
00:59:59,246 --> 01:00:02,246
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf
waiting for my life to happen.

1440

Aw, Sheriff.

You're selling
yourself short.

I think you'd make
a great lost toy.

You really don't think

you'll ever be in

You'd be surprised.

1457
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:40,724
So, how'd you end up in this
store in the first place?

1458
01:00:40,794 --> 01:00:43,141
Well, I saw your lamp
in the window...

1459
01:00:43,195 --> 01:00:47,014
and I thought maybe
you were inside...

1460
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:48,878

1461
01:00:52,655 --> 01:00:53,755
Wow.

This is the only part
of the store I ever liked.

01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:07,155
Forky's still in there.

1556
01:05:07,191 --> 01:05:08,904
If we hurry, we can get him
before they lock him up.

1557

You want us
to go back in there?

got out alive.

1559

Woody, it's better
if we wait.

1560
01:05:12,848 --> 01:05:15,003
No, no, no. There's no time.
We can easily get back inside.

1561
01:05:15,074 --> 01:05:15,759
But I saw Bonnie's...

1562
01:05:15,837 --> 01:05:17,061
By my count, there were
only four dummies.

1563
01:05:17,097 --> 01:05:17,837
But the backpack...

1564
01:05:17,936 --> 01:05:19,103
We outnumber them.
So we have the advantage.

1565
01:05:19,202 --> 01:05:20,890

Because it's all
I have left to do!

1576
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:44,103
I don't have anything else.

1577

So, the rest of us
don't count?

That's not what I meant.

1579

No. You need Bonnie!

1581
01:05:54,529 --> 01:05:55,778
Open your eyes, Woody.

1582
01:05:55,879 --> 01:05:57,884
There's plenty of kids
out there.

1583
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:01,946
It can't be just about the
one you're still clinging to.

1584
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:03,945

But I do.

1622
01:07:40,511 --> 01:07:44,178
You were left in the
closet, feeling useless...

ever get played with.

Can we agree
on just one thing?

What?

1627
01:07:52,038 --> 01:07:54,145
That being there for a child

1628
01:07:54,246 --> 01:07:57,544
is the most noble thing
a toy can do.

must have been like for you.

All that time you
spent with Andy...

1633
01:08:14,112 --> 01:08:18,145
riding a bike with him
for the first time...

1634

when he skinned his knee...

proudly watching him
grow up.

1636
01:08:25,045 --> 01:08:28,179
And then you got a second
chance with Bonnie...

she's scared at school...

just one of those moments.
