<i>If he keeps this pace up
he could have a chance at the...</i>

8
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,796
He's coming in. He's coming in.

9
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,958
Let's go!

10
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,338
I know you're tired.
Come on! Let's make this fast!

11
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:35,273
Move! Move! Move!

12
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,997
She's running a little hot, but we're good.

13
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,156
Fire!

14
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,729
Get him the blanket.

15
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:47,281
Get it off me! Off!

16
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:50,400
You okay?

17
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:54,539
Fill the tank!

18
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,024
- Shelby, you just...
- Am I on fire?

19
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,648
- Am I on goddamn fire?
- No, you're not...

20
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,892
Fill the tank!

21
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,231
- Where am I, Eddie?
- Two laps up my friend.

22
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:10,423
We're good. Go get 'em.

00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:37,168
<i>Aston Martin #5 driven by Carroll Shelby

25

- Takes the title.</i>

<i>-An American wins Le Mans!
-Shelby!</i>

30
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,376
- Carroll Shelby.
- What?

31
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,767
This is something
you can't ignore anymore.

32
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,342
Oh, I take the pills. The pills work.

33
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:01,949
An elevated heart rate, say 130 BPM

34
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,095
sustained even for a short period,
you run a critical risk of cardiac arrest.

35
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:08,665
- I'll race shorter format then.
- That's not gonna work.

36
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,435
I could race NASCAR, Formula 1.

37
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:15,312
The valve is shot, Shelby.
This is as serious as it gets.

38
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:18,292
In my opinion you're lucky
to be sitting here today.

39
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,546
Well, I feel real lucky.

40
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,804
Luckiest guy on Earth.

41
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:49,248
<i>There's a point at 7000 RPM
where everything fades.</i>

42
00:03:57,256 --> 00:04:02,437
<i>The machine becomes
weightless, just disappears.</i>

43
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:03,647
<i>Hey!</i>

44
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:15,673
<i>And all that's left is a body
moving through space and time.</i>

45
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:23,873
<i>7000 RPM.</i>

46
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:26,979
<i>That's where you need it.</i>

47
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:32,510
<i>It asks you a question.</i>

48
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,406
<i>The only question that matters,</i>

49
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,715
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

50
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,319
Now it's Von Trips in the Ferrari
coming into the corkscrew.

51
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,566
He's braking late,

52
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:55,273
He's set a new lap record!

53
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,770
<i>- Yes I do.
- No, you don't!</i>

54
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,079
A month ago this car was fun.

55
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,748
Now, it won't even start.
And when it does it's...

56
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:05,249
Boom, boom, boom!

57
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:09,226
<i>When I pull out of the driveway,
the dog has a heart attack.</i>

58
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:12,461
<i>All I'm asking is for you
to make it like it was.</i>

59
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:15,984
Yeah, you've cocked up the
inlet valves and the plugs.

60
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:18,452
Nothing wrong with the car.
It's the way it's being driven.

61
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,596
<i>The way it's being driven?</i>

62
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:21,937
<i>Too much fuel and not enough spark.
That's what's making her misfire.</i>

63
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:24,091
You wanna run that
by me in English?

64
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,623
All right, sir.

65
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:29,024
So...

66
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:33,498
That there, that is a sport car.

67
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:35,782
You have to drive her like a sport car.

68
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:38,802
If you drive her like a school teacher,
she'll clog up.

69
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,567
Try changing up at 5000 RPM, not two.

70
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:48,259
Drive like you mean it.
Hard, tight, she'll run clean.

71
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:52,349
Are you telling me
I don't know how to drive my own car?

72
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:54,498
No.

73
00:05:54,825 --> 00:06:00,518
But if you ask me, this isn't your car.
Your car is more a Plymouth, a Studebaker.

74
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:04,255
You and me have a problem, buddy?

75
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:07,660
I don't have a problem.
I had an MG. Mine ran just fine.

76
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:10,975
Screw you you limey prick.
I want my money back!

77
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:13,281
Behave, I'd give it to ya.

78
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:15,458
But you haven't paid
for last months service yet.

79
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,213
This country,
the customer's always right.

80
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:20,357
- You ever hear that?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,056
Utter nonsense.

82
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:28,039
Now remember, I advanced the timing,
so, smidge twitchy in first!

83
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:32,322
Get her revs up. Good lad, revs up.

84
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,957
Tada.

85
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:39,544
Another satisfied customer?

86
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,688
Can I help you, Miss?

87
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:47,978
Wasn't that an MGA 1500?

88
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,847
You know your cars.

89
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,650
I like them.

90
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:57,876
I love the sound they make.
The way it goes right through you.

91
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,774
That vibration.

92
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:08,758
Mine's the
wood paneled Country Squire.

93
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:11,101
'Cross the street.

94
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,076
A real hotrod.

95
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:15,377
Oh, yeah?

96
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:17,140
- Is it fast?
- Very.

97
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,615
Wait a second,
what type of girl are ya?

98
00:07:20,828 --> 00:07:23,525
Type of girl who likes the smell
of wet gasoline.

99
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,047
Burnt rubber.

100
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:28,012
Are you some kind of a deviant?

101
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,616
Only since I married you.

102
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:40,229
- Hey, Gary.
- What's going on?

103
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:57,753
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

104
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,879
Shut it down, Mr. Beebe.

105
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,449
John!

106
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,150
All stop!

107
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:35,961
Hear that?

108
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:42,770
That's the sound
of the Ford Motor Company

109
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:45,156
out of business.

110
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:56,010
In 1899, my grandfather
Henry, by God, Ford

111
00:08:56,238 --> 00:09:01,584
was walking home from Edison Illumination
after working a double shift.

112
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:03,907
He was ruminating.

113
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:09,285
That morning he had himself an idea
that changed the world.

114
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,678
65 years and 47 million
automobiles later,

115
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,721
what shall be his legacy?

116
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:23,580
Gettin' it in the tailpipe
from a Chevy Impala.

117
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,601
Here's what I want you to do,
walk home.

118
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:38,527
While you're walking,
I want you to ruminate.

119
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:45,162
Man comes to my office with an idea,
that man keeps his job.

120
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:50,451
Rest of you second best losers, 
stay home.

121
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:53,228
You don't belong at Ford.

122
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:04,118
Shelby.

123
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:09,707
I see you. Up and at 'em, buddy.

124
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:13,612
- Hey.
- Go away.

125
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,231
Come on, you can do it.

126
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:18,470
Come on, baby.

127
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:22,299
8:30 AM, time to roll.
Let's go!

128
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,803
- Let's go! Let's go! Go! Go!
- Go away!

129
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:27,664
It's 8:30 AM, baby. Time to roll.

130
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:29,991
Come on.

131
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:32,983
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, Bob.

132
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,646
Is Shelby here?

133
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,655
It's touch and go.

134
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,200
Shelby, you're up bright and early.

135
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,511
Well,

136
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:48,213
early bird gets the worm, Pops.

137
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:53,362
All right, who are you worried about?

138
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:57,924
Well, You got Red Faris and Bill Rushton.
They're all in 327's.

139
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,638
Corvettes. What about Bondurant?

140
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,321
Bondurant? Well, he's still driving...

141
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:03,764
Mr. Shelby, can I get an autograph?

142
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:06,050
number 614.

143
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,407
All right, just relax, all right?

144
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:10,282
We gonna eat
those 'Vettes for breakfast.

145
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:13,671
We're lighter, we're faster.
An' that don't work, we're nastier.

146
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:21,441
Hey Phil,
take it easy on us today, bud.

147
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,761
Alright.

148
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:29,877
Paragraph 15.4 Section 2B
of the SCCA standard

149
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:36,296
dictates all AF class cars must have
minimum trunk space of 20" by 12" by 6".

150
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,165
Your trunk doesn't close,

151
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,371
- ergo car fails standard.
- Wait, wait. What?

152
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:42,908
Ergo car is disqualified from
said Class AF.

153
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,133
No, no, no.

154
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:45,571
- Can I ask you a question?
- Alright.

155
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:49,941
When you were a little boy,
did you think, when I grow up

156
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,712
I wanna go to the fabled
Willow Springs Raceway

157
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,472
and I wanna enforce
Paragraph 15.4 Section 2B

158
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:58,122
of the SCCA regulations
on luggage capacity.

159
00:11:58,123 --> 00:11:59,734
All right, that's it.

160
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,345
I'm ruling you and your team
disqualified from this race.

161
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:07,122
Ah well, If it isn't Lance Reventlow.

162
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:08,250
Shelby.

163
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,075
How you're doing Lance?

164
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,048
- Pops.
- Hey Lance.

165
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:11,504
Allow me to introduce
Dieter Voss.

166
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:13,006
Runs Brumos Porsche
out of Jacksonville Florida.

167
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:14,591
I know all about Mr. Voss,

168
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:16,752
you're having a hell of a
season with that Abarth, sir.

169
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,377
- Seeing results for your Cobra too.
- Thank you.

170
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:22,503
- Your guy Miles is impressive.
- You're following Miles?

171
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:25,662
Well, he was a USAC road
racing champ in '61.

172
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,207
He won the Pikes
Peak Hill Climb.

173
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,824
He was SCCA C-class champion,
3 years in a row

174
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:32,221
in this piece of shit
MG he built himself.

175
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:33,956
We heard he's difficult.

176
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:36,024
What, Ken? No, no.
Ken's a puppy dog.

177
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:38,105
Hey Lance,
tell the man you raced against Ken.

178
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:41,087
However, I've driven more
behind him than against him.

179
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:45,891
Brumos is looking for a driver
for our number two car at Sebring.

180
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,292
- Is that right?
<i>- How is that even possble?</i>

181
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:49,480
You think your guy Miles
can make the grade?

182
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:50,959
- Oh, well...
<i>- Hey!</i>

183
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:55,552
Jim, is he putting his
bloody carry-on in your trunk?

184
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:58,271
Gentlemen, excuse me a moment.

185
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,899
To be honest, Ken was born for Sebring.

186
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:08,163
Nothing in there about my trunk
and your lovely little portmanteau.

187
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:11,226
You're holding the '62 edition of the SCCA.

188
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:16,742
You can stick this bloody sticker
where the sun never shines.

189
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:19,145
Hey. Hey Bill,
what seems to be the problem?

190
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,593
The problem is
that Bill here is an arsehole.

191
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,762
- No, he doesn't mean that.
- Yes, he does.

192
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:27,574
He really does think
that Bill is an arsehole.

193
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:29,044
I'm just doing my job here.

194
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:31,916
Bill, in my experience, there is...
Listen to me.

195
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:34,141
<i>Something like this, there's always
a middle ground, all right?</i>

196
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:35,917
<i>- Ken's out of line, all right?
- And I'm just doing my job.</i>

197
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:36,789
<i>I understand you are.</i>

198
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,153
<i>You know how he gets on a race day.</i>
You know that, all right?

199
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:41,259
But you're not gonna DQ us
over a trunk.

200
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,491
Happy, Bill?

201
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,705
Yeah, ah, I am.

202
00:14:03,705 --> 00:14:06,932
I'll talk to him.
You just go and have a great day.

203
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,137
Shit.

204
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:13,616
Bulldog.

205
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:16,946
Do you know who that was
I was just talking to?

206
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:18,573
- Bill.
- Before that.

207
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:19,629
No.

208
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:22,399
- It was Dieter Voss.
- Who's that?

209
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,289
He runs Porsche, Ken.

210
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:27,888
It's a little German car company,
maybe you heard of it.

211
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:28,489
Right?

212
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:31,759
He wanted you to drive at Sebring,
but he'd heard you were difficult.

213
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:39,807
I thought we felt
the same way about...

214
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:42,460
Germans.

215
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:49,141
Do you like losing, Ken?

216
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:53,206
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

217
00:14:53,962 --> 00:14:55,502
I don't lose.

218
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:59,130
Without sponsors,
you get no car, Ken.

219
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,839
Now last I checked,
the professionals all have a car.

220
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,855
You cannot win the SCCA without one.
If you're not winning you are losing.

221
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:09,351
Don't make me lump this
at your head.

222
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:12,164
Did you bring your son all the way
out here to watch you get disqualified

223
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:13,649
<i>or just act like a jackass?</i>

224
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,425
Well, that answers that.

225
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,668
Peter.

226
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,673
May I help you, gentlemen?

227
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,053
Ah, yes, is Ken Miles here?

228
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,071
No.

229
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:00,586
- We need to speak to Mr. Miles.
- I'm his wife.

230
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,640
<i>Welcome to the 1963 Willow Springs 100</i>

231
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:07,290
<i>12 cars will be competing
in this 40 lap race.</i>

232
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:11,535
Hey Ken,
what happened to your shield?

233
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:14,469
New design.

234
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,142
<i>Well, it looks like we're about to begin.</i>

235
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:21,410
<i>The cars have completed the warm-up lap.
The green flag is out.</i>

236
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,535
<i>And they're approaching the starting line.</i>

237
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:26,254
Here we go.

238
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,436
Bloody hell!

239
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:37,806
Learn to drive, you pillock!

240
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:45,528
So, Shelby, you miss it?

241
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:48,939
Hey, Sam.

242
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:54,714
Guy wins the 24 Hour of Le Mans.
Suddenly retires, starts selling cars.

243
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,633
It just don't make sense.

244
00:16:57,634 --> 00:17:00,429
Well, unless the rumors are true,
of course.

245
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,805
What rumors would those be, Sam?

246
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,802
That Carroll Shelby quit driving
'cause he lost his nerve.

247
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:14,675
I'm gonna out brake ya
on the next turn, Bob.

248
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:28,464
Nice try, Bob

249
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,949
<i>Nice move from Ken Miles.
22 laps remaining,</i>

250
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,950
with Phil Hill and
Dan Gurney in the lead.

251
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:16,709
<i>It's been an incredible day
here at Willow Springs.</i>

252
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,857
<i>And we've seen some exciting driving.</i>

253
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:22,342
<i>With just 1 lap remaining
in this 40 lap race.</i>

254
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:24,376
<i>We're coming to the final stretch.</i>

255
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:28,341
<i>Dan Gurney has been leading
the pack for the most of the...Woah!</i>

256
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:31,952
<i>Red Faris is off the track.</i>

257
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:36,339
<i>That leaves Dan Gurney for the lead,
followed by journeyman Ken Miles.</i>

258
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,268
Now for you, Dan.

259
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,477
<i>And they're coming
around the last turn.</i>

260
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:51,132
<i>Gurney is still in the lead
with Ken Miles hot on his heel.</i>

261
00:18:58,332 --> 00:18:59,801
<i>Miles is looking for an opening.</i>

262
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:01,020
Not yet.

263
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,029
Come on!

264
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:05,912
<i>Can Gurney hold him off
in the final straight?</i>

265
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,217
Not yet.

266
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,295
<i>Gurney is blocking him out.</i>

267
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,613
Now.

268
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:19,360
Nice move, Ken.

269
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:24,698
<i>They're wheel to wheel.</i>

270
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,303
Come on!

271
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:40,250
<i>An incredible finish for Ken Miles.
Didn't see that one coming.</i>

272
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:45,085
He's difficult but good.

273
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,710
That calls for a nice cup of tea.

274
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,739
- I've got the kettle on.
- Hop in.

275
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:10,916
Pops, frame this.

276
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,586
Hey.

277
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,528
We did it!

278
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:31,256
What's wrong?

279
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:36,587
The IRS came.
They've padlocked the garage.

280
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:43,863
All right, Petey.

281
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:58,278
Couple of years ago,

282
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:01,003
you said we'd a nest-egg.

283
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,460
Correct.

284
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:06,352
- A couple of years ago.
- Correct.

285
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:13,986
So, just to be clear,
we are buggered.

286
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:15,879
Absolutely.

287
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,390
As in totally?

288
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:29,697
As in not a bean
or a pot in which to piss.

289
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,207
<i>Spares, stock, all gone.
Tools, my tools are locked up in there.</i>

290
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,658
I'll figure something out.

291
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:44,043
<i>In 1945, our soldiers came home.</i>

292
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,132
What was the first thing
that they did?

293
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:49,849
They had sex.

294
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:54,985
17 years later, those babies,
they've grown.

295
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:58,377
They've got jobs,
they've got licenses.

296
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:00,154
But they do not wanna drive

297
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:03,740
the same dull 50's cars
their parents drove.

298
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:09,490
You see, kids today, they want glamor.
They want, eh, sex appeal.

299
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,139
<i>They wanna go fast.</i>

300
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:12,805
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

301
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:16,982
it's time for the Ford Motor Company
to go racing.

302
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:20,559
We're already in racing, Iacocca.

303
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:24,293
<i>NASCAR? It's regional, sir.</i>

304
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:26,758
If you go to the movies,

305
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:30,576
you open up a magazine, you don't see
good ol' boys in Winston-Salem.

306
00:22:30,577 --> 00:22:31,916
You see

307
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:34,809
Sophia Loren,

308
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:37,500
Monica Vitti.

309
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:43,204
James Bond does not
drive a Ford, sir.

310
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,217
That's because he's a degenerate.

311
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:50,806
See?

312
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:53,092
God, I'd like to be a degenerate.

313
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:54,963
Just give me one second, please.

314
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:56,661
Is this part of it?

315
00:22:56,764 --> 00:22:59,673
- Is this going anywhere, Iacocca?
- Sorry, sir.

316
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:02,050
<i>- All right, Alright. That's enough.</i>
- Sir, if you just bear with me...

317
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,014
Turn it off, lights!

318
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:13,320
<i>Lee, in the last 3 years,
you and your marketing team</i>

319
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:18,432
have presided over
the worst sale slump in US history.

320
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:23,589
Why exactly should
Mr. Ford listen to you?

321
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:28,421
Because we've been thinking wrong.

322
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:32,784
Ferrari.

323
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:36,677
Now they've won 4 out
of the last 5 Le Mans.

324
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,673
We need to think like Ferrari.

325
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:44,512
Ferrari makes fewer cars in a year
than we make in a day.

326
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:50,313
We spend more on toilet paper
than they do on their entire output.

327
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,762
You want us to think like them?

328
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:54,927
Enzo Ferrari will go down in history

329
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:57,294
as the greatest car
manufacturer of all time.

330
00:23:58,689 --> 00:23:59,939
Why?

331
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:04,418
Is it because he built the most cars?

332
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:06,798
No.

333
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:10,249
It's because of what his cars mean.

334
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,372
Victory.

335
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,192
Ferrari wins at Le Mans.
People they...

336
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,063
They want some of that victory.

337
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:23,356
What if the Ford badge meant victory?

338
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:27,331
And meant it where it counts with the
first group of 17-year-olds in history,

339
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,501
- with money in their pockets.
<i>- This would take years.</i>

340
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:36,382
Decades to test and develop a race team
capable of taking on Ferrari.

341
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,268
Ferrari's bankrupt.

342
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:45,124
Enzo spent every lire he's got chasing
perfection, and you know something?

343
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,794
He got there.

344
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,786
But now he's broke.

345
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:15,717
You don't have to give up racing
to get a bloody day job, Ken.

346
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:16,956
I think I do.

347
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:21,215
I've had my fun, it's time
to put food on the table and grow up.

348
00:25:21,331 --> 00:25:23,817
The garage didn't pay the pills.
Now it's locked up.

349
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:26,593
Racing doesn't pay them either
and I keep winning.

350
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:28,314
Yeah, because you're good.

351
00:25:28,315 --> 00:25:30,866
But I can't play the game.

352
00:25:31,054 --> 00:25:33,428
<i>I'm not what they call 'a people person'.</i>

353
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:34,415
<i>You don't say.</i>

354
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:37,049
<i>And I'm 45 years old,
Do you really think I'm gonna change?</i>

355
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,132
<i>I'm never gonna get the good rides.
I started too late.</i>

356
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,354
Because you fought
in the bloody war!

357
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:48,368
If you stop,
you'd be bloody insufferable.

358
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:52,484
It was quick going 'round the region.
It's over.

359
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:54,706
<i>Let's look on the bright side.</i>

360
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:58,901
<i>Now I can get fat and old,
trim the roses and eat pork pies.</i>

361
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:22,082
Scuzi, please.

362
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,128
<i>No photos, prego.</i>

363
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,239
Relax.

364
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,442
You gotta understand.

365
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:29,320
This is like the Mafia showing up
to buy the Statue of Liberty.

366
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,704
Kind of the opposite, actually.

367
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:34,047
If the Press gets wind of this,
the shit will hit the Fangio.

368
00:26:34,517 --> 00:26:38,354
- Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.
- Franco Gozzi, Ferrari.

369
00:26:38,968 --> 00:26:41,713
Sonno queste...
Your journalist?

370
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:46,834
No, no, Mr. Iacocca.
It's our cameras, just for history.

371
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,724
Four liter Colombo engine.

372
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:57,313
One man assembles
the entire engine by himself.

373
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:01,806
Another man assembles the transmission.

374
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,831
Everything hand-built.

375
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:08,045
Bellissimo.

376
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:22,424
Racing department.

377
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,461
Lee, that's him.

378
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:35,284
<i>This merger between our companies
will form two entities.</i>

379
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,048
<i>Ford-Ferarri, 90% owned by Ford
who controls all production.</i>

380
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:53,006
Secondly, Ferarri-Ford, the race team.
90% owned by Ferrari.

381
00:27:58,373 --> 00:28:02,776
In order to secure this
Ford will pay the sum...

382
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,690
10 million dollars.

383
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,196
Excuse me.

384
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,033
He will need some time to read this.

385
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:40,716
Please.

386
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,179
Yeah, of course.

387
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:39,696
All done, thank you.

388
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:59,354
Only one small question.
It concerns my race program.

389
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:13,470
If I wish to race Le Mans and you
do not wish for me to race Le Mans,

390
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:15,764
Do we or do we not go?

391
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:27,137
In that highly unlikely scenario,

392
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:33,529
if we just can't agree then, yes.
I mean, no.

393
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:36,140
You are correct.

394
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:38,505
You do not go.

395
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:58,822
My integrity as a constructor,
as a man, as an Italian

396
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,902
is deeply insulted by your proposal.

397
00:31:02,202 --> 00:31:03,788
<i>Go back to Michigan.</i>

398
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:10,684
Back to your big ugly factory.

399
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,954
Back to your big ugly factory
making its ugly little cars.

400
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:25,855
Tell your pig-headed boss that all his...

401
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,816
smug executives are
worthless sons of whores.

402
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:35,773
Tell him he's not Henry Ford.

403
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:40,525
He is Henry Ford the second.

404
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,311
He played us.

405
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,641
Old man Enzo had no intention
of selling to us.

406
00:32:13,017 --> 00:32:16,116
He used us to up his price.

407
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:19,426
Embarrass our company,
insult your leadership.

408
00:32:19,657 --> 00:32:22,313
It was a bad idea from the start.

409
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:33,179
What exactly did he say?

410
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:46,242
He said Ford makes ugly little cars,
and we make 'em in an ugly factory.

411
00:32:47,984 --> 00:32:51,458
He said our executives are
sons of whores.

412
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:56,826
About me.

413
00:32:58,325 --> 00:33:00,506
He called you fat, sir.

414
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:04,243
Pig-headed.

415
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:06,850
Go on.

416
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:10,369
He said you're not Henry Ford.

417
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:13,509
You're Henry Ford the second.

418
00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:38,496
I want the best engineers.

419
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:42,069
The best drivers.

420
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:46,367
I don't care what it costs.

421
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:51,605
We're gonna build a race car.

422
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:00,290
And we're gonna bury
that goddamn greasy wop

423
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:04,750
a hundred feet deep
under the finish line at Le Mans.

424
00:34:05,414 --> 00:34:08,448
And I will be there to watch it.

425
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,123
Here they come.
Go, go, go!

426
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:17,103
- Asshole!
- You're really pathetic!

427
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:18,300
I'm so sorry, girls.

428
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:20,917
Charlie, quit throwing
crackers at the girls

429
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:22,918
all damn day, goddammit.

430
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:26,122
- Do I gotta deal with this?
- It's already taken care of.

431
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:28,296
Sorry about that.

432
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:32,204
- So, yeah. 289 cubic inch V8.
- Far out.

433
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:34,473
Extensive rework of AC Ace's front end

434
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:36,582
and a stronger rear diff
to handle the torque.

435
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:38,495
How'd she handle the quarter mile?

436
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,973
Well, I'm not saying
you should go drag racing.

437
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:43,965
But quarter mile is 13.6. Yeah.

438
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:45,742
- Is that good?
- That's real good.

439
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:48,570
He sold that same car
3 times this week.

440
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,733
- You take cash? Is cash okay?
- Cash is okay.

441
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:52,217
Yeah, mister, you just bought yourself

442
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:54,072
- one hell of a sport car.
<i>- Alright.</i>

443
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,325
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna...Phil.

444
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:01,061
I'm gonna pass you off to my colleague
here, he gonna take care of you.

445
00:35:01,062 --> 00:35:02,865
Phil, Wyatt.

446
00:35:02,866 --> 00:35:04,677
I'll steal him for one second.

447
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,752
You take the payment.

448
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:09,989
Whatever you do, do not let him take
that car, that's Jeff Blitzer's car.

449
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,998
And Frank Collins's,
and Steve McQueen's.

450
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:14,375
Shit, I forgot about McQueen.

451
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,414
Morning, can I help you?

452
00:35:21,516 --> 00:35:23,244
Carroll Shelby.

453
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:25,283
Maybe.

454
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:28,130
Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.

455
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,722
What's with the wrench?

456
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:36,229
That? Long story.

457
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:39,965
We are just goin'
from strength to strength here, Lee.

458
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:43,431
Terrific sales.
We're killing it on the track. Now..

459
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,668
Now I know I owe Ford
for that last batch of engines...

460
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:48,523
Mr. Shelby, I can assure you
I'm not here for money

461
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:50,358
that you might owe
Ford for spare parts.

462
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:53,239
You're not?

463
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,595
No, I'm not.

464
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:57,460
Okay.

465
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,416
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Ford,
Henry Ford II.

466
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:03,546
Suppose, hypothetically,

467
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:07,712
he wanted his company
to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

468
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:11,386
You're one of the only Americans
that's ever done it.

469
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:15,187
I'm wondering, what's it take?

470
00:36:18,537 --> 00:36:20,083
Hypothetically?

471
00:36:20,854 --> 00:36:22,533
Hypothetically.

472
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:25,877
Well, it'll take something money can't buy.

473
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:28,590
Money can buy speed.

474
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:31,696
It isn't about speed, Lee.

475
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,593
It's not just like those other
tracks where all you do is

476
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:37,672
turn to the left for 4 hours.

477
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:41,492
To win that race, you need a car

478
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:43,644
that's light enough to do
200 on the straightaways,

479
00:36:43,645 --> 00:36:47,396
but strong enough to keep that up
for 3000 miles without a break.

480
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,455
Not just the best car y'all have ever made,

481
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:54,890
but better than anything that 
Enzo Ferrari shows up with that year.

482
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:56,773
And that just gets
you to the green flag,

483
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:58,773
that's where your
problems really start.

484
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:04,029
- Is everything okay?
- Go away.

485
00:37:11,324 --> 00:37:13,371
So, you're saying it's challenging.

486
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:18,121
Look, it's not even a track, Lee.

487
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,469
Le Mans' 8.5 miles of country road.

488
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:25,324
It's narrow, ungraded. It's rough.

489
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:28,652
There's no camber on the turns, no rails.

490
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:33,336
You gotta do that for 24 hours.

491
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,734
24 hours, Lee.

492
00:37:38,379 --> 00:37:40,079
That means night.

493
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:43,363
Half of that race is in the dark,
you can't see shit.

494
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,053
Cars coming up on you out of nowhere.

495
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:51,874
Drivers stumblin' around the track,
pourin' blood.

496
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:56,438
Maybe one of 'em's your friend,
maybe he's on fire.

497
00:37:58,244 --> 00:38:00,495
You're exhausted, you're hungry.

498
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:03,557
Can't remember your name,
what country you're in,

499
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:08,024
and all of a sudden you realize
you're doing 198 on the straight.

500
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:13,460
And if anything goes wrong.

501
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:17,286
You blow a gasket, 5 cent washer.

502
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:19,769
That's it, whole thing's over.

503
00:38:20,145 --> 00:38:22,263
Ferrari wins again.

504
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:23,927
Just like it won last year.

505
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:26,204
The year before that,
and the year before that.

506
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:34,030
Yeah, it's challenging.

507
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:38,484
You don't think that
Ford Motor Company can build

508
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,476
the greatest race car
the world's ever seen?

509
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:44,984
You think that we are incapable
of winning an event like that?

510
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:47,926
Even if we had a brilliant partner?

511
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:53,762
Even if we wrote a blank check?

512
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:04,143
What I'm saying is
you can't buy a win, Lee,

513
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:11,166
but maybe you could buy the guy
who gets you a shot.

514
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,564
A new transmission.
Axles, shocks all around.

515
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,553
Ditch the body and the tires,
you have yourself a contender.

516
00:39:36,326 --> 00:39:38,153
Anything on this beauty
that does work?

517
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:40,879
The mirrors are outstanding.

518
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,694
I saw that walking up.

519
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:47,800
So, what? You're just
passing or evening stroll?

520
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:50,643
Actually, bulldog,
I have a proposition for you.

521
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:55,351
You gonna build a car
to beat old man Ferrari?

522
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:59,356
With Ford. With a Ford?

523
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:00,522
Correct.

524
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,684
And how long did you tell them
that you needed?

525
00:40:02,685 --> 00:40:04,696
Two, three hundred years?

526
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,524
90 days.

527
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:13,295
All right, so, let's just look
at this for a moment.

528
00:40:13,963 --> 00:40:15,498
And for argument's sake,

529
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:17,964
let's just forget about
the whole 90 day thing.

530
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:19,568
Let's just pretend you got
all the money in the world

531
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:21,955
and all the time in the world.

532
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:23,871
- I like the sound of that.
- Alright, so.

533
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:28,152
You think that Ford
are gonna let you build

534
00:40:28,854 --> 00:40:33,866
the car that you want
the way you want it?

535
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:36,781
The Ford Motor Company?

536
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:39,792
Those guys?

537
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,809
Have you ever been to Detroit? I mean,
they have floors and floors of lawyers,

538
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,811
and millions of marketing guys,
and they're all gonna wanna meet you,

539
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,631
all of them gonna wanna get their photo
taken with the great Carroll Shelby,

540
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:51,562
and they're gonna kiss your arse

541
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:53,631
and they're gonna go back
to their lovely offices,

542
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:56,053
and they're gonna work out
new ways to screw you.

543
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,783
Why? Because they can't help it.

544
00:40:58,784 --> 00:41:00,668
Because they just wanna
please their boss,

545
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:04,363
who wants to please his boss,
who wants to please his boss.

546
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:08,239
And they hate themselves for it, 
but deep down,

547
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,745
who they hate even
more, are guys like you,

548
00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:14,959
because you're not like them,
because you don't think like them,

549
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
because you're different.

550
00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:20,522
It's coming straight from the Deuce.

551
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,008
He's serious.

552
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:25,402
They're gonna put real money behind it.

553
00:41:28,762 --> 00:41:30,568
I bet they are.

554
00:41:31,123 --> 00:41:35,367
You know why? Because someone,
and I'm not saying who.

555
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:41,320
Someone has told them
that this is actually possible.

556
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:45,427
Look, this Sunday at Cloverfield,
they're launching the new Mustang.

557
00:41:45,428 --> 00:41:47,396
<i>They're gonna announce the race program.</i>

558
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:50,060
Just come on by.

559
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:54,659
Come take a look.
Listen to my speech.

560
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:58,286
I'm making a speech.
Bring Peter, he'll love it.

561
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:01,950
Alright, Shel.

562
00:42:04,328 --> 00:42:05,626
See you Sunday.

563
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,027
Woah.

564
00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:14,091
Dad, look at that.

565
00:42:18,046 --> 00:42:20,754
Ford Mustang. What do you think?

566
00:42:23,982 --> 00:42:26,161
I think it's a secretary's car.

567
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,357
I like it.

568
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,820
Oh, excuse me, excuse me.

569
00:42:35,282 --> 00:42:37,302
Would you not do that?

570
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:40,223
Sorry.

571
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,447
- Oh, is this your son?
- Yes, it is.

572
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:50,830
Would you ask him
to keep his hands off the paintwork?

573
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,315
No, no, Petey, you're okay.
Who are you?

574
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:57,176
Leo Beebe, Senior Executive Vice President,
Ford Motor Company.

575
00:42:57,177 --> 00:43:00,107
I am responsible
for the launch of the Mustang.

576
00:43:00,107 --> 00:43:02,857
Well, at least now we
know who's responsible.

577
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:04,694
- Don't get me wrong, Lenny.
- Leo.

578
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:09,157
It looks fantastic but
inside it's a lump of lard

579
00:43:09,158 --> 00:43:10,595
dressed up to fool the public.

580
00:43:10,596 --> 00:43:15,582
My advice is: lose the inline 6
and that idiotic 3 speed,

581
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,222
shorten the wheelbase.
Somehow lose half a ton.

582
00:43:19,316 --> 00:43:21,490
- And lower the price.
- Dad.

583
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,230
But even then
I'll still choose the Chevy Chevelle.

584
00:43:25,765 --> 00:43:28,361
That's a fucking terrible car.

585
00:43:29,624 --> 00:43:31,345
<i>How're we doing up there, Steve?</i>

586
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:33,889
There's Cloverfield, Mr. Shelby.

587
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:35,689
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

588
00:43:36,336 --> 00:43:38,804
You mind if I take a shot
at the landing?

589
00:43:39,461 --> 00:43:42,979
No no, I mean it. I flew B-29s
outta San Antonio in '44.

590
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,601
- You're kidding.
- I did.

591
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:45,959
Okay.

592
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,535
Carroll, what are you doing?

593
00:43:47,536 --> 00:43:48,813
- Does he know how to fly?
- Carroll.

594
00:43:48,814 --> 00:43:51,170
I had an instructor tell me

595
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:54,000
Look Don, I would say
it's probably a good time to buckle up.

596
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:56,251
Do everybody a favor
and stay on the ground.

597
00:43:56,712 --> 00:43:58,526
That's a true story.

598
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:05,141
This is the car you never
expected from Detroit.

599
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,470
Alright, let's go.

600
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:14,007
Not staying, Ken?

601
00:44:14,007 --> 00:44:16,800
Nah, it's a bloody pig 
in a poke, isn't it?

602
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,325
Oh, here they come now.

603
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:25,167
- Wait, are they crashing?
- Oh, lord.

604
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,932
Who's the pilot?

605
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,199
My guess, Peter...

606
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:33,877
Someone we know.

607
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:36,816
<i>Everything all right up there?</i>

608
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:38,074
Oh, no!

609
00:44:38,751 --> 00:44:39,882
<i>- Hang on.
-Shit!</i>

610
00:44:39,883 --> 00:44:42,233
Shit!

611
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:48,333
Tell you what,
that's like riding a bike.

612
00:44:54,552 --> 00:44:57,280
Talk about making an entrance.
Good grief.

613
00:44:58,148 --> 00:44:59,856
<i>- Shelby!
- Over here!</i>

614
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:03,187
How're y'all doin'.

615
00:45:04,257 --> 00:45:05,617
Can we get an autograph, sir?

616
00:45:05,618 --> 00:45:06,995
Shelby, this is Roy Lunn.

617
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,615
Ol' Roy here is developing
the prototype over in England.

618
00:45:09,615 --> 00:45:11,799
Oh hell, I know Roy.
Good to see you, Roy.

619
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,023
Welcome to the madhouse, Shelby.

620
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:15,615
Ford wheeled out the entire
executive committee for this one.

621
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:17,712
Hold that thought.

622
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:20,864
- Ah.
- Hello, Mr. Lindbergh.

623
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:22,836
You like that?
Hey, Peter, how're you doing?

624
00:45:22,837 --> 00:45:24,294
- Mr. Shelby.
- Good to see you.

625
00:45:24,295 --> 00:45:26,874
Are you building a car
that's gonna beat Ferrari?

626
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:30,425
Well, we're gonna go to Le Mans,
that's for sure.

627
00:45:30,426 --> 00:45:32,514
And if we get across that finish
line first we gonna win.

628
00:45:32,515 --> 00:45:36,429
Carroll, allow me to introduce Leo Beebe,
Senior Vice President Ford Motor.

629
00:45:36,774 --> 00:45:37,497
Oh, sure, yeah.

630
00:45:37,498 --> 00:45:38,738
- Please Mr. Beebe.
- Thank you for coming.

631
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:40,810
Say hello to Ken Miles
and his son Peter.

632
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,621
- We...
- Right.

633
00:45:42,622 --> 00:45:44,037
We met.

634
00:45:44,037 --> 00:45:44,953
<i>Yeah.</i>

635
00:45:46,186 --> 00:45:48,206
- Didn't we?
- So, um...

636
00:45:49,577 --> 00:45:52,527
I'll take Petey for some pop.

637
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:54,443
Good luck with these guys, Shel.

638
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:56,421
- Bye, Mr. Shelby.
- See you, Pete.

639
00:45:56,746 --> 00:45:58,493
Don't worry, he's gonna stay.

640
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,932
So, you two get a chance
to talk on the plane?

641
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:07,450
Yeah, Carroll, why don't we just, 
step this way for a second.

642
00:46:14,376 --> 00:46:16,410
Look, it's pro forma,
it's window dressing.

643
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:20,141
But there's gotta be a sense of getting
the tape between you and you know.

644
00:46:21,103 --> 00:46:23,241
- No, I don't.
- The group.

645
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:24,373
The group?

646
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,472
Senior creatives, Carroll.
Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.

647
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:29,906
I'm confused, Lee.

648
00:46:29,907 --> 00:46:32,991
'Cause up until this moment
right now I was comfortable.

649
00:46:33,744 --> 00:46:35,676
Why don't you take a look
out there, Carroll?

650
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:37,394
What do you see?

651
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:40,555
Do you know what I see?
I see a machine.

652
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:43,927
I see ten thousand moving parts
moving, hopefully, in harmony.

653
00:46:43,928 --> 00:46:46,959
And it's my job to make it so.
It's my job to guide you through it.

654
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,619
I'm here to help you, Carroll.
But you gotta trust me.

655
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:53,731
- Excuse me, Lee.
- Carroll.

656
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:56,189
Do not step on that stage
if you don't trust me.

657
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:58,686
<i>Please, welcome Mr. Carroll Shelby.</i>

658
00:46:58,687 --> 00:47:00,287
Gotta go.

659
00:47:06,943 --> 00:47:09,333
- What'd he say?
- He gets the drill.

660
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:13,854
Thank you.

661
00:47:14,354 --> 00:47:16,266
If my Daddy was here today,

662
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:21,153
he'd tell me to sit on down
and leave the yackin' to the college boys.

663
00:47:21,502 --> 00:47:24,021
Like my cars, I'll make this fast.

664
00:47:26,165 --> 00:47:28,841
When I was 10 years old,
Pops said to me, "Son,

665
00:47:29,422 --> 00:47:33,383
it's a truly lucky man who knows
what he wants to do in this world."

666
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:36,146
<i>'Cause that man will never work
a day in his life.</i>

667
00:47:36,892 --> 00:47:39,442
But there are a few, a precious few,

668
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:41,564
and hell I don't know
if they're lucky or not,

669
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:45,640
but there are a few people
who find something they have to do.

670
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,573
<i>Something obsesses them.</i>

671
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,450
Something if they can't do it,

672
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,451
it's gonna drive them
clean outta their mind.

673
00:47:54,463 --> 00:47:56,151
I'm that guy.

674
00:47:56,842 --> 00:47:59,807
And I know one other man
feels exactly the same.

675
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:02,611
His name...

676
00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:07,088
His name is Mr. Henry Ford.

677
00:48:11,143 --> 00:48:15,516
And together we're gonna build
the fastest automobile in the world.

678
00:48:18,338 --> 00:48:21,734
And we're gonna make
history too, at Le Mans.

679
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:25,683
- Let's go.
- What?

680
00:48:26,495 --> 00:48:31,041
My name is Carroll Shelby.
I build race cars.

681
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:56,271
No. Whatever it is, no.

682
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:59,218
No.

683
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:01,399
30 minutes.

684
00:49:01,517 --> 00:49:02,986
Ah, I just...

685
00:49:03,429 --> 00:49:05,228
I'm spent, I wanna have a bath.

686
00:49:05,229 --> 00:49:08,713
You gonna wanna see this.
Trust me.

687
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:12,982
30 minutes. I'll have you back
for meatloaf and gravy.

688
00:49:15,973 --> 00:49:18,412
- 30 minutes.
- Yeah.

689
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:38,769
Bloody hell.

690
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:46,410
Fresh off the plane from England.

691
00:49:46,411 --> 00:49:47,411
Now,

692
00:49:48,604 --> 00:49:52,001
She's still a little
on the rare side of cooked.

693
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:03,327
Come on.

694
00:50:16,123 --> 00:50:17,512
Interesting.

695
00:50:34,194 --> 00:50:35,314
Well?

696
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:38,036
- It's awful.
- It's worse than awful.

697
00:50:38,037 --> 00:50:41,345
It doesn't track.
The 3rd gear is too high,

698
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:45,341
torque is not reaching the road.

699
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:49,247
Steering's loose because
the front end gets light.

700
00:50:49,248 --> 00:50:51,736
At over 140 it thinks it's...

701
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,633
- Airplane.
- Yeah.

702
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:56,576
It wants to lift off and fly to Hawaii.

703
00:50:59,134 --> 00:51:01,018
Anything else?

704
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,270
One second.

705
00:51:37,691 --> 00:51:39,560
You were back late last night.

706
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:41,140
Yeah.

707
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:45,924
Were you working?

708
00:51:50,129 --> 00:51:52,067
So you didn't go any place.

709
00:51:52,557 --> 00:51:53,867
What?

710
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,628
I'm asking, did you go
any place last night?

711
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:02,154
Mollie.

712
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:04,305
It's a simple question.

713
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,107
And I answered, didn't I?

714
00:52:08,107 --> 00:52:09,792
What was the answer?

715
00:52:11,617 --> 00:52:13,425
Is something up, love?

716
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:15,889
What are you doing?

717
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,150
What are you doing?
You're driving very fast.

718
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:19,773
Am I? Am I?

719
00:52:19,774 --> 00:52:21,677
Yes, you are!

720
00:52:23,024 --> 00:52:25,245
Bloody hell!
What are you? What is this?

721
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,205
You tell me 'cause I dunno.

722
00:52:27,206 --> 00:52:29,023
What? Slow down!

723
00:52:29,023 --> 00:52:31,518
Whoa, whoa, Mollie!

724
00:52:34,004 --> 00:52:37,853
Please, Slow it down! Alright?
You're trying to kill us or something?

725
00:52:37,853 --> 00:52:40,034
- I thought we love this shit.
- What?

726
00:52:41,671 --> 00:52:42,569
Bloody hell!

727
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:45,806
- It's a bit of racing fun, no?
- No no no, it's not the same at all!

728
00:52:46,224 --> 00:52:48,173
Well I think it's thrilling!

729
00:52:48,729 --> 00:52:49,920
Alright.

730
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:52,384
Look, I saw you, all right?

731
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:55,837
I saw you leaving with Shelby,
and I saw you coming back.

732
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:57,504
Okay, shit, okay.
Slow down.

733
00:52:57,505 --> 00:52:59,579
And then all day you got
that stupid look on your face.

734
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,312
Mollie, slow down!
You're too close in.

735
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:07,529
<i>Mollie, put on the brakes right now!</i>

736
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,719
Not until you tell
me what's going on!

737
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,189
Alright, I went to look at a car.

738
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,149
- With Shelby?
- With Shelby.

739
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,404
- A racing car?
- Sort of.

740
00:53:17,596 --> 00:53:20,068
There's a corner coming,
you better hold on.

741
00:53:20,815 --> 00:53:23,361
Mol, are you gonna lift your foot off
at all through this?

742
00:53:23,362 --> 00:53:25,111
No. 'Cause I like a clean racing line.

743
00:53:25,112 --> 00:53:26,729
Slow down!

744
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:34,171
Okay. Shel offered me a job.
Ford has a car

745
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:36,428
that they wanna put up
against Ferrari.

746
00:53:36,428 --> 00:53:40,110
- You told me you were done!
- I didn't say yes!

747
00:53:40,437 --> 00:53:42,905
- Slow down!
- You told me you quit!

748
00:53:44,025 --> 00:53:46,364
- I don't understand.
- Get fat and old you said!

749
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:48,533
Fat and old!

750
00:53:51,981 --> 00:53:53,612
<i>- I don't understand.</i>
- That's what you told me!

751
00:53:53,612 --> 00:53:55,151
I don't understand.

752
00:53:55,453 --> 00:53:59,864
Are you upset because I said I was done
or because I looked at a race car?

753
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:03,829
Just don't lie to me again!

754
00:54:05,374 --> 00:54:08,482
Don't make it a secret,
what you want or what you feel

755
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:11,721
just because you think
it's gonna make me happy!

756
00:54:13,344 --> 00:54:15,936
Mol, I don't even know what I feel.

757
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:24,635
If you do this

758
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:29,752
they better be paying you this time.

759
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:34,493
'Cause I can't work any more hours
and look after Peter.

760
00:54:34,494 --> 00:54:38,291
The IRS have the garage,
I'm not losing my home.

761
00:54:38,748 --> 00:54:40,768
It's 200 a day

762
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:45,035
plus expenses.

763
00:54:47,502 --> 00:54:49,190
Are you shitting me?

764
00:54:49,191 --> 00:54:51,778
But, I haven't decided.

765
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:56,547
200 dollars a day?

766
00:54:58,663 --> 00:55:00,512
Are you nuts?

767
00:55:23,437 --> 00:55:25,506
This is ridiculous.

768
00:55:27,773 --> 00:55:30,912
Grabbing air. That's the problem.

769
00:55:31,782 --> 00:55:35,470
Over 90, air's getting in, not getting out.

770
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:37,557
It's the nose.
I can feel it in the wheel.

771
00:55:37,558 --> 00:55:39,964
Mr. Miles, if there's a problem
the computer will find it.

772
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:43,734
Charlie, get some scotch tape
and a ball of wool.

773
00:55:44,681 --> 00:55:45,681
Alright.

774
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:50,806
Good, good good. So now let's just
get all of this junk out.

775
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:52,181
All right, Pops?

776
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,382
Yeah, yeah. I concur.
Come on guys.

777
00:55:57,148 --> 00:55:58,608
What are they doing?

778
00:55:58,765 --> 00:56:00,443
Making your car faster.

779
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:10,717
There, right there.
Airflow's getting stuck.

780
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,261
I see it. Yarn blows straight up.

781
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:18,902
- Yep.
<i>- Front's lifting. Damn, he's right.</i>

782
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:33,405
This car wants to go faster. I feel it.

783
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:35,835
<i>Any lighter we're getting fragile.</i>

784
00:56:35,836 --> 00:56:37,919
We took 70 pounds out
of her in the last week.

785
00:56:37,919 --> 00:56:41,040
She's outputting max horsepower
from this displacement.

786
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:44,923
- So put in a bigger engine.
- Where we gonna put it? On the roof?

787
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:51,508
Managed to make it 52 pounds lighter
than the NASCAR unit.

788
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:58,468
All new aluminum cylinder heads.

789
00:56:59,263 --> 00:57:02,588
Vibration dampers, Water pump,
Smaller valves.

790
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:04,864
We call it 'The Beast'.

791
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:09,353
I can see why, but how's it gonna fit
without redesigning the engine bed?

792
00:57:09,353 --> 00:57:12,140
Well, it certainly wasn't easy.
Good Morning, gentlemen, Mr. Shelby.

793
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:16,381
So, you already put that in a GT-40?

794
00:57:17,024 --> 00:57:18,987
I'm afraid we have.

795
00:57:24,457 --> 00:57:26,444
<i>I'll be damned.</i>

796
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:27,623
Well, it's heavy, of course.

797
00:57:27,624 --> 00:57:30,413
Problems with the handling especially
the stopping. I can show you the data.

798
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:31,465
What problem?

799
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:33,964
- Understeers a little, but...
- Can I borrow that?

800
00:57:34,558 --> 00:57:36,043
Just a second, thank you.

801
00:57:36,043 --> 00:57:38,074
Ken, Ken!

802
00:57:38,682 --> 00:57:40,751
Perhaps we ought to check
with HQ before you take...

803
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:43,242
- What'd he say?
- We should ask...

804
00:57:43,698 --> 00:57:45,120
Alright.

805
00:57:48,321 --> 00:57:49,521
Oh, yes!

806
00:57:57,385 --> 00:57:59,826
Mr. Shelby. Welcome to Dearborn.

807
00:57:59,827 --> 00:58:01,003
What are you doing
at a test track?

808
00:58:01,004 --> 00:58:03,270
You're gonna get Castrol
all over that nice suit.

809
00:58:04,012 --> 00:58:06,175
I want to hear your thoughts
on a few planning decisions.

810
00:58:06,175 --> 00:58:07,745
You know, personnel for Le Mans.

811
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:09,378
Well, It's a hell of a line up,

812
00:58:09,378 --> 00:58:12,913
Ken Miles, Phil Hill,
Chris Amon, Bruce McLaren.

813
00:58:12,914 --> 00:58:15,442
Hill's a lock,  Amon, McLaren too.

814
00:58:15,442 --> 00:58:17,210
We're less sure about Miles.

815
00:58:17,211 --> 00:58:21,827
We like Richie Ginter,
Masten Gregory, Bob Bondurant?

816
00:58:22,338 --> 00:58:26,798
You want the best driver for the car,
who understands the machine, that's Ken.

817
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:29,509
<i>Oh, Yes!</i>

818
00:58:30,435 --> 00:58:33,764
More of that, please.
More of that, my girl.

819
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:37,628
<i>I may not get the finer points of racing
Mr. Shelby, but I do know people.</i>

820
00:58:37,991 --> 00:58:42,260
Miles is...He's a beatnik.
He dresses like one.

821
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:46,822
Ford means reliability.
Ken Miles is not a Ford man.

822
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:48,538
Whoa!

823
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:50,675
Giddyup, giddyup!

824
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:56,011
What's the lap record here, Burt?

825
00:58:56,012 --> 00:58:57,392
1.58.

826
00:58:58,332 --> 00:58:59,781
1.50, dead.

827
00:58:59,781 --> 00:59:00,789
<i>A beatnik? </i>

828
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:03,280
That man landed a busted
tank on the beach at D-Day

829
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:05,554
and drove it clean
across Europe to Berlin.

830
00:59:06,326 --> 00:59:07,655
A beatnik?

831
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:09,615
You know, Lee here asked me a while back,

832
00:59:09,615 --> 00:59:11,334
what's the one thing money can't buy.

833
00:59:12,313 --> 00:59:13,518
I'll tell you what it is.

834
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:16,218
A pure racer behind
the wheel of your car.

835
00:59:16,802 --> 00:59:18,527
That's Ken Miles.

836
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:22,277
Well, be that as it may,

837
00:59:22,538 --> 00:59:25,002
we think he may be too pure.

838
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:35,751
Carroll, do not lose sight
of the big picture here.

839
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,187
Too pure?

840
00:59:39,104 --> 00:59:40,787
What exactly does that mean?

841
00:59:41,574 --> 00:59:43,663
Means he's all about himself.

842
00:59:44,857 --> 00:59:49,184
ABC puts a microphone under his nose.
Perhaps there's a detail he dislikes.

843
00:59:49,184 --> 00:59:50,558
Millions watching.

844
00:59:50,558 --> 00:59:53,008
Do you trust him not to put out
the wrong message?

845
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:55,483
Well look, you could get a clean
cut all American poster boy.

846
00:59:55,484 --> 00:59:58,010
And stick him behind the wheel.
Teach him what to say.

847
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:01,256
Shit, you get Doris Day to drive the car
if all you wanna do is lose.

848
01:00:01,576 --> 01:00:04,577
So, you don't agree with us
on this issue?

849
01:00:06,913 --> 01:00:09,240
I'm saying you're gotta trust me
on this one.

850
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:12,705
Carroll, with marketing concerns,
that's just not possible.

851
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:18,041
Put a Ford type driver
in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby.

852
01:00:18,267 --> 01:00:20,366
That's the Ford way.

853
01:00:26,419 --> 01:00:29,142
<i>Yet another championship win for Ferrari...</i>

854
01:00:32,034 --> 01:00:33,576
Ferrari wins.

855
01:00:36,893 --> 01:00:38,571
Wedges, we have wedges.

856
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:40,155
Good, good, good.

857
01:00:40,716 --> 01:00:42,040
Perfect.

858
01:00:42,982 --> 01:00:44,597
- 40?
- Yup.

859
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:55,325
Hey, boss.

860
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,307
You got a passport?

861
01:00:58,308 --> 01:01:00,493
- What's that?
- Sign that, Get a passport.

862
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,663
Get it back to me by Friday.
Frosty.

863
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,848
Boys, I'm going to France.

864
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:07,438
Phil.

865
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,730
Ken, can I get a word?

866
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,564
Can I take this?

867
01:01:21,286 --> 01:01:26,269
Do you know why Ford named it the GT-40?
Why they put that 40 on there?

868
01:01:26,269 --> 01:01:28,365
- No.
- Regulations.

869
01:01:28,365 --> 01:01:33,998
We gotta be 40 inches high
to make the ground clearance requirements.

870
01:01:33,998 --> 01:01:36,685
No more, no less.
They measure it before every race.

871
01:01:36,686 --> 01:01:42,262
Problem is that with that height
there's too much drag under the car.

872
01:01:42,262 --> 01:01:43,356
So...

873
01:01:43,357 --> 01:01:46,117
We have a solution, Wedges.
We put wedges in...

874
01:01:46,118 --> 01:01:47,803
You're not coming next week.

875
01:01:50,668 --> 01:01:52,992
You're not coming, Ken.

876
01:01:55,422 --> 01:01:58,269
We're taking McLaren,
Chris Amon, Phil Hill

877
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:01,291
and Bob Bondurant.

878
01:02:01,703 --> 01:02:03,117
This is Ford's call.

879
01:02:04,536 --> 01:02:06,965
It is their opinion that
you are not a good image,

880
01:02:06,966 --> 01:02:08,794
so you cannot drive their race car.

881
01:02:10,688 --> 01:02:13,449
Putting aside the fact that you made
that car whatever the hell it is,

882
01:02:14,525 --> 01:02:17,540
and you're the best man I got
behind the wheel.

883
01:02:37,193 --> 01:02:39,268
I'm gonna re-route the oil line.

884
01:02:39,268 --> 01:02:42,964
If there's spillage it could drip
onto the rear near side disc.

885
01:02:42,964 --> 01:02:44,013
Ken.

886
01:02:44,013 --> 01:02:49,477
Tell the boys to watch
their pace come sunrise.

887
01:02:49,477 --> 01:02:53,238
The gearbox will overheat.

888
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:13,626
Ken, race is starting soon.
Want it on the radio?

889
01:03:13,807 --> 01:03:15,713
Not unless you do.

890
01:03:35,648 --> 01:03:38,287
<i>There they are the Maserati
going into the esses,</i>

891
01:03:38,287 --> 01:03:40,444
<i>but it's still the #2 car
driven by Chris Amon.</i>

892
01:03:40,445 --> 01:03:44,115
<i>In third place is the #1 Ford
driven by Bruce McLaren.</i>

893
01:03:44,115 --> 01:03:46,533
<i>A tremendously fast start for the Ford GT.</i>

894
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:50,728
<i>3:43.4 lap for car #2 Ford.</i>

895
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:53,625
<i>I think it's a little bit quick
for this stage of the game.</i>

896
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:56,026
Racing too hot?

897
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:06,640
<i>Another Ford has come in to the pit</i>

898
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:09,139
<i>it is being pushed into
the pit by the mechanic.</i>

899
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:13,227
Head gasket.
The car's not a moon rocket.

900
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:18,715
<i>Leading #20 Ferrari of Michael Fahr.</i>

901
01:04:18,715 --> 01:04:21,434
So, we have Fords running one,
two, three, how about that?

902
01:04:21,434 --> 01:04:24,264
Too soon, surely too soon.

903
01:04:41,383 --> 01:04:44,049
<i>Here's the big story,
the lead Ford driven by</i>

904
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:47,557
<i>Rickie Getzer retires with
gearbox trouble and the new leader...</i>

905
01:04:47,558 --> 01:04:52,500
Gearbox.
I told them to be gentle with it.

906
01:04:57,642 --> 01:04:59,197
Who's there?

907
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:12,103
What's that you're listening to?

908
01:05:12,228 --> 01:05:14,664
Some race over in France.

909
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:18,955
Excited?

910
01:05:19,658 --> 01:05:22,501
Not really paying much attention.

911
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:41,690
It's not exactly Champagne.

912
01:05:44,205 --> 01:05:46,096
But it's got bubbles.

913
01:06:15,365 --> 01:06:17,274
Thanks, Mollie.

914
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:03,558
Grace?

915
01:07:10,655 --> 01:07:11,926
Yes, sir?

916
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,409
I will send him right in.

917
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:16,433
<i>Thank you.</i>

918
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:21,286
Mr. Shelby, Mr. Ford will see you now.

919
01:07:21,594 --> 01:07:23,191
Alright.

920
01:07:24,335 --> 01:07:25,503
This guy...

921
01:07:27,338 --> 01:07:29,335
This way, Mr. Shelby.

922
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:41,690
Mr. Ford, gentlemen.

923
01:07:41,966 --> 01:07:43,526
<i>Shelby.</i>

924
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:59,036
Give me one reason why
I don't fire everyone

925
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:02,241
associated with this
abomination, starting with you.

926
01:08:08,934 --> 01:08:10,955
Well, sir.

927
01:08:11,371 --> 01:08:14,001
I was thinking about that very question

928
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:16,267
as I sat out there in
your lovely waiting room.

929
01:08:17,856 --> 01:08:21,683
As I was sitting there, 
I watched that little red folder

930
01:08:21,684 --> 01:08:25,406
right there go
through four pairs of hands

931
01:08:26,723 --> 01:08:28,488
before it got to you.

932
01:08:28,727 --> 01:08:30,782
Of course, that don't include

933
01:08:30,782 --> 01:08:33,154
<i>the 22 or so other Ford employees</i>

934
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:36,149
<i>who probably poked at it before it
made its way up to the 19th floor.</i>

935
01:08:38,135 --> 01:08:42,964
With all due respect, sir,
you can't win a race by committee.

936
01:08:44,248 --> 01:08:46,494
<i>You need one man in charge.</i>

937
01:08:46,674 --> 01:08:51,591
Now, the good news, as I see it,
is that even with all the extra weight

938
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:57,095
we still managed to put ol' Mr. Ferrari
exactly where we want him.

939
01:08:58,183 --> 01:09:00,640
- Did we?
- Oh, yes.

940
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:04,818
Expand.

941
01:09:05,495 --> 01:09:06,764
Well,

942
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,035
sure, we haven't...

943
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:12,951
We haven't worked out
how to corner yet.

944
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:15,404
Or stay cool,

945
01:09:15,404 --> 01:09:18,282
<i>or stay on the ground.</i>

946
01:09:18,282 --> 01:09:20,515
And a lot of stuff broke.

947
01:09:21,026 --> 01:09:24,159
In fact, the only thing that didn't break
was the brakes.

948
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,998
Hell, right now, we don't even know

949
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:28,566
if our paint job will
last the whole 24 hours.

950
01:09:34,729 --> 01:09:40,984
But our last lap, we clocked 218 mph
down the Mulsanne straight.

951
01:09:40,984 --> 01:09:44,640
Now, in all his years of racing,

952
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:49,252
ol' Enzo ain't never seen
anything move that fast.

953
01:09:49,814 --> 01:09:53,461
And now he knows without a doubt,

954
01:09:54,652 --> 01:09:56,851
we're faster than he is.

955
01:10:00,048 --> 01:10:04,451
Even with the wrong driver
and all the committees.

956
01:10:05,997 --> 01:10:07,902
And that's what he's thinking about

957
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:11,684
while he's sitting in
Modena, Italy right now.

958
01:10:14,059 --> 01:10:16,253
That man is scared to death

959
01:10:17,094 --> 01:10:21,766
that this year you actually
might be smart enough to start trusting me.

960
01:10:24,298 --> 01:10:25,899
So, yeah.

961
01:10:27,381 --> 01:10:30,651
I'd say you got Ferrari
exactly where you want him.

962
01:10:34,117 --> 01:10:35,602
You're welcome.

963
01:10:53,163 --> 01:10:54,726
Come here.

964
01:11:02,212 --> 01:11:04,642
You see that little building down there?

965
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:10,708
In World War II, three out of five
US bombers rolled off that line.

966
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:17,751
You think Roosevelt beat Hitler?
Think again.

967
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:21,761
This isn't the first time
Ford Motor's gone to war in Europe.

968
01:11:23,455 --> 01:11:26,267
We know how to do more
than push paper.

969
01:11:28,342 --> 01:11:31,938
And there is one man
running this company.

970
01:11:33,349 --> 01:11:35,501
You report to him.

971
01:11:36,078 --> 01:11:37,908
You understand me?

972
01:11:38,072 --> 01:11:39,812
Yes, sir.

973
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:43,600
Go ahead, Carroll. Go to war.

974
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,945
Thank you, sir.

975
01:12:20,272 --> 01:12:22,961
You were right.
It's the gearbox.

976
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,327
We ran too hot.

977
01:12:26,139 --> 01:12:30,053
Three out of four of 'em broke.
Rod blew on other one.

978
01:12:34,986 --> 01:12:37,019
We're goin' back, Ken.

979
01:12:40,383 --> 01:12:43,988
They told me I had
<i>a carte blanche</i> this time.

980
01:12:45,355 --> 01:12:48,125
I looked it up,
it's French for 'horse shit'.

981
01:12:48,126 --> 01:12:50,063
I know they gonna squeeze
our nuts any way they can

982
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:51,398
as soon as they work out how.

983
01:12:52,616 --> 01:12:56,295
Well, the ice cream's melting.

984
01:12:59,186 --> 01:13:00,991
Alright. Hey, Ken.

985
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:03,799
You want me to apologize?

986
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,651
You want me to beg?

987
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:12,386
I don't know, let's try it out.
Let's see how that feels.

988
01:13:18,909 --> 01:13:22,347
Ken, I'm sorry, sincerely.

989
01:13:26,852 --> 01:13:28,741
Do you have any idea
the kind of shit

990
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:31,233
that I had to eat just to
get 4 wheels on that grid?

991
01:13:31,234 --> 01:13:33,780
No, you don't, 'cause you don't deal
with any of that stuff.

992
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,347
Now, knock it off, Ken!

993
01:13:35,348 --> 01:13:38,039
We got work to do,
and this car ain't gonna build itself.

994
01:13:46,608 --> 01:13:48,520
Okay, alright.

995
01:14:01,527 --> 01:14:02,662
Come here!

996
01:14:03,444 --> 01:14:05,324
Bloody car salesman.

997
01:14:05,325 --> 01:14:06,836
Shit!

998
01:14:08,842 --> 01:14:11,092
Come on. Now you're
gonna get this.

999
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:16,838
Get off me!

1000
01:14:19,139 --> 01:14:20,939
Stubborn son of a bitch!

1001
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:38,858
Come here!

1002
01:14:41,859 --> 01:14:43,059
Done.

1003
01:14:48,123 --> 01:14:49,439
<i>Mollie, darling.</i>

1004
01:14:50,054 --> 01:14:51,490
Yes, love?

1005
01:14:51,491 --> 01:14:53,610
Could you get me a fizzy pop, please?

1006
01:14:54,343 --> 01:14:55,964
Yes, love.

1007
01:14:57,432 --> 01:14:59,510
- Do you want one too, Shelby?
- No.

1008
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:01,784
- Yes, please, Mollie.
- No, Mollie. No.

1009
01:15:01,785 --> 01:15:05,306
He can get his own. Just for me, please.

1010
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,245
How long's that been?

1011
01:15:14,002 --> 01:15:16,621
It's gotta be
three or four years at least.

1012
01:15:17,247 --> 01:15:21,771
- Riverside.
- Yeah, the SCCA Divisional Championship.

1013
01:15:21,771 --> 01:15:22,774
You broke my finger.

1014
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:25,793
What was that? That?

1015
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:29,041
Nippy...
Nippy bloody thing?

1016
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,849
You did on the arm that thing.

1017
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:32,585
Yeah, I call that 'The Llama bite.'

1018
01:15:32,586 --> 01:15:34,035
You named it.

1019
01:15:35,126 --> 01:15:37,576
Where'd you learn that?
From the girl scouts?

1020
01:15:37,776 --> 01:15:39,324
You wanna go again?

1021
01:15:39,325 --> 01:15:40,781
<i>Here you go.</i>

1022
01:15:41,431 --> 01:15:43,312
- You're an angel.
- Thank you.

1023
01:15:43,531 --> 01:15:45,104
My pleasure.

1024
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:48,302
Right. Well,
I'm about to go to the grocery store.

1025
01:15:48,302 --> 01:15:50,326
Anything you think you'll need?

1026
01:15:51,345 --> 01:15:57,376
Ice cream, Ice cream would be good.
And...bread.

1027
01:15:58,408 --> 01:16:01,569
- Right.
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

1028
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:03,445
Thanks, Mol.

1029
01:16:04,348 --> 01:16:06,369
Still take those for you ticker?

1030
01:16:06,569 --> 01:16:08,656
Only because they're so delicious.

1031
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:10,315
Up yours.

1032
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,217
Ah, go to hell.

1033
01:16:19,523 --> 01:16:21,180
Giddyup, giddyup!
Giddyup, giddyup!

1034
01:16:37,351 --> 01:16:38,722
Sam.

1035
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:41,733
One for you mate.
Dino, come here.

1036
01:16:59,419 --> 01:17:00,419
Well?

1037
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:04,501
There's still a lag when I hit the gas.
Let's get rid of the vacuum secondaries.

1038
01:17:04,502 --> 01:17:07,566
Charlie, get a Holley carb
we're gonna rebuild the throttle assembly.

1039
01:17:07,775 --> 01:17:12,460
Three weeks to Daytona
and it still feels like a bag of squirrels.

1040
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:15,264
Brake heat.
That's a whole different ball game.

1041
01:17:15,867 --> 01:17:18,293
All right, Petey.
Let's go for that ride.

1042
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:28,370
What're you doing?

1043
01:17:29,627 --> 01:17:32,968
See that crack?
That's my marker for turn 8.

1044
01:17:35,866 --> 01:17:37,588
What, to slow down?

1045
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:41,156
Ah, brush the brakes and downshift.

1046
01:17:43,256 --> 01:17:45,668
But you'll be going a 150 mph.

1047
01:17:46,466 --> 01:17:47,703
Yeah.

1048
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:49,592
So how do you see it?

1049
01:17:49,593 --> 01:17:55,320
You go fast, but as the car speeds up
everything else slows down.

1050
01:17:55,321 --> 01:17:59,693
You don't do that.
You do this, right?

1051
01:17:59,693 --> 01:18:02,321
And then you see everything.

1052
01:18:04,530 --> 01:18:06,343
Do you set other markers?

1053
01:18:06,344 --> 01:18:11,173
Indeed I do. Lots of them.

1054
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:17,586
Yeah, 'cause you can't just push
the car hard the whole way, right?

1055
01:18:17,587 --> 01:18:18,636
That's right.

1056
01:18:18,637 --> 01:18:24,824
You have to be kind to the car. You feel
the poor thing groaning underneath you.

1057
01:18:25,772 --> 01:18:29,375
If you're gonna push a piece
of machinery to the limit

1058
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,419
and expect it to hold together,

1059
01:18:31,419 --> 01:18:35,732
you have to have some sense
of where that limit is.

1060
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:43,950
Look out there.
Out there is the perfect lap.

1061
01:18:46,093 --> 01:18:47,631
No mistakes.

1062
01:18:48,006 --> 01:18:50,701
Every gear change, every corner.

1063
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,541
Perfect.

1064
01:18:54,745 --> 01:18:56,432
You see it?

1065
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:01,681
I think so.

1066
01:19:03,361 --> 01:19:05,166
Most people can't.

1067
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:09,133
Most people don't even know
it's out there but it is.

1068
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,968
It's there.

1069
01:19:15,499 --> 01:19:17,529
You want some ice cream?

1070
01:19:19,388 --> 01:19:20,897
- Yeah.
- Alright.

1071
01:19:21,828 --> 01:19:23,257
Come on then.

1072
01:19:23,403 --> 01:19:25,500
- You know what this marker is?
- What?

1073
01:19:25,608 --> 01:19:27,850
That one.
Pull my finger. You'll find out.

1074
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,890
How much longer
before he comes in?

1075
01:19:52,572 --> 01:19:55,776
Well, we change drivers every 4 hours,
so about 10 minutes.

1076
01:19:55,776 --> 01:19:56,673
<i>No, hang on,</i>

1077
01:19:56,674 --> 01:19:58,819
You're saying Beebe is
a 100% in charge now?

1078
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:01,060
<i>Yes, and he wants Miles gone.</i>

1079
01:20:01,353 --> 01:20:03,149
Look, it is personal with this guy.

1080
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:05,750
Yes, he has the leverage
is to stick with you.

1081
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:08,578
<i>He and the Deuce are flying there tomorrow.
He's gonna tell you in person.</i>

1082
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:11,082
All he is hoping for
is that you lose your cool.

1083
01:20:11,731 --> 01:20:14,355
<i>It's time to let this go.
You cannot destroy</i>

1084
01:20:14,355 --> 01:20:15,913
the whole thing,
not for one goddamn guy.

1085
01:20:15,914 --> 01:20:17,791
- Sure I can.
<i>- But why?</i>

1086
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:20,862
'Cause while we're here talking,
he's out there getting it done.

1087
01:20:29,328 --> 01:20:30,981
Oh, shit!

1088
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:33,279
He's got brake fade.

1089
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:41,380
Ease off!

1090
01:20:53,293 --> 01:20:55,963
<i>- Get him out!</i>
- Peter! Just go inside.

1091
01:20:56,464 --> 01:20:57,883
Just stay there!

1092
01:20:58,178 --> 01:21:00,141
- Ken!
- Get him out!

1093
01:21:02,016 --> 01:21:04,488
<i>- Hurry!
- Ken!</i>

1094
01:21:11,743 --> 01:21:13,425
- Ken!
<i>- Come on.</i>

1095
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,550
The brakes.

1096
01:21:30,841 --> 01:21:33,856
Let's just rip out the damn
engine, alright.

1097
01:21:33,856 --> 01:21:36,604
We can't use it
if we can't stop.

1098
01:21:36,604 --> 01:21:39,948
The brakes would last longer
if you slowed down a bit.

1099
01:21:39,949 --> 01:21:42,623
Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose
of the extra power?

1100
01:21:43,394 --> 01:21:46,010
Y'know, I thought the whole point was
to win the damned race.

1101
01:21:46,405 --> 01:21:48,572
<i>Maybe we could design
a new assembly.</i>

1102
01:21:48,572 --> 01:21:52,283
Instead of swapping out
the pads in the pits,

1103
01:21:52,584 --> 01:21:56,931
swap out the entire
braking system, rotors included.

1104
01:21:57,661 --> 01:21:58,973
Put in a fresh one.

1105
01:21:59,087 --> 01:22:02,125
Wait, wait. Pops.
We're allowed to do that?

1106
01:22:02,235 --> 01:22:05,025
I don't know. I don't read French.

1107
01:22:08,082 --> 01:22:11,722
Brakes are a part like any other, right?

1108
01:22:11,722 --> 01:22:14,755
- We are allowed to change parts.
- Yes.

1109
01:22:14,756 --> 01:22:16,036
<i>Will we have time to do that?</i>

1110
01:22:16,037 --> 01:22:17,986
<i>I don't know yet, Charlie.</i>

1111
01:22:18,293 --> 01:22:21,064
- I'm gonna take him home.
- Alright.

1112
01:22:21,205 --> 01:22:23,555
- Sort this shit out.
- I will.

1113
01:22:33,118 --> 01:22:35,552
Have you ever been on fire?

1114
01:22:39,307 --> 01:22:41,439
Well, no, no. It's never happened to me.

1115
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:50,461
The suit's flameproof, see.
Keeps heat out.

1116
01:22:51,738 --> 01:22:52,919
Yeah.

1117
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:58,018
But Lewis Evans burnt to death
in the Moroccan Grand Prix.

1118
01:22:58,019 --> 01:23:00,131
He had a flameproof suit on.

1119
01:23:02,421 --> 01:23:03,979
Yeah, but...

1120
01:23:06,812 --> 01:23:10,088
See, he got stuck.
He couldn't breathe.

1121
01:23:10,806 --> 01:23:14,790
So as long as you get out
of the car, you're okay.

1122
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:20,193
Dad got out.

1123
01:23:21,417 --> 01:23:23,720
- He sure did.
<i>- Peter.</i>

1124
01:23:27,531 --> 01:23:30,203
- Bye.
- See ya.

1125
01:23:33,152 --> 01:23:35,227
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1126
01:23:35,822 --> 01:23:37,569
What's wrong with you?

1127
01:23:37,921 --> 01:23:41,783
Don't tell me brakes or me almost
kicking the bucket out there.

1128
01:23:41,784 --> 01:23:44,532
It's something to do
with the suits, isn't it?

1129
01:23:46,552 --> 01:23:48,031
It's under control.

1130
01:23:48,032 --> 01:23:49,596
What is it?

1131
01:23:49,597 --> 01:23:51,965
You know how we talked about
you do your thing, I do my thing.

1132
01:23:51,966 --> 01:23:53,051
This is my thing.

1133
01:23:53,052 --> 01:23:55,422
- Shel.
- Just trust me, Ken.

1134
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:57,401
You got a plan?

1135
01:23:57,989 --> 01:23:59,456
Absolutely.

1136
01:23:59,807 --> 01:24:01,281
A good one?

1137
01:24:01,774 --> 01:24:02,961
It's high risk.

1138
01:24:03,186 --> 01:24:05,925
- How high risk?
- Extremely high risk.

1139
01:24:07,728 --> 01:24:09,716
Well, that's something.

1140
01:24:09,906 --> 01:24:12,273
- Glad we had this talk.
- Anytime.

1141
01:24:24,353 --> 01:24:26,748
Mr. Ford, this is a surprise.

1142
01:24:27,475 --> 01:24:30,178
Apologies for the
unannounced intrusion, Mr. Shelby.

1143
01:24:30,178 --> 01:24:33,029
A man pays 9 million dollars
for an automobile

1144
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:35,030
he ought to at least be able to see it.

1145
01:24:35,271 --> 01:24:36,863
That sounds reasonable enough.

1146
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:39,639
- Shelby, can I have a word?
- Sure.

1147
01:24:39,965 --> 01:24:41,183
In private?

1148
01:24:41,183 --> 01:24:43,863
- Ah, yeah, that would be preferable.
- Alright.

1149
01:24:43,864 --> 01:24:48,586
Hey Phil, you wanna take care of Mr. Ford
here? Mr. Ford, that's Phil Remington.

1150
01:24:48,586 --> 01:24:50,281
- Of course.
- Come to my office, Leo.

1151
01:24:50,282 --> 01:24:51,662
Pleasure, sir.

1152
01:24:51,662 --> 01:24:53,943
Let me give a little tour of your car.

1153
01:24:54,682 --> 01:25:00,818
We took out your 289 small block
and put in a 427.7 liter.

1154
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:05,712
Firstly, I wanna just clear the air.

1155
01:25:06,003 --> 01:25:10,205
I hope that whatever disagreements
between us can just be chalked up to

1156
01:25:10,694 --> 01:25:13,717
natural red-bloodedness
in the heat of battle.

1157
01:25:13,718 --> 01:25:16,444
I appreciate that Leo. Truly, I do.

1158
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:21,499
It falls on me, Shelby,
to inform you that

1159
01:25:21,499 --> 01:25:25,515
I have been appointed overall
Executive Director of the Racing program.

1160
01:25:26,949 --> 01:25:30,651
Now, I do hope that
this won't be a problem between us.

1161
01:25:31,454 --> 01:25:33,758
I assure you, Leo, it will not.

1162
01:25:43,864 --> 01:25:45,275
Hey, Carroll!

1163
01:25:45,914 --> 01:25:46,468
Carroll!

1164
01:25:46,469 --> 01:25:49,264
And what is the top speed
with the 427?

1165
01:25:49,265 --> 01:25:51,918
- Why don't we take it for a spin?
- What?

1166
01:25:51,919 --> 01:25:54,610
Go on, Mr. Ford.
Hope on in, go on.

1167
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:57,706
- You want me to...
- To see what 9 million dollars feel like.

1168
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:05,888
Open the door!

1169
01:26:06,026 --> 01:26:07,689
Hey, open the door!

1170
01:26:07,854 --> 01:26:09,684
Open the door!

1171
01:26:12,295 --> 01:26:14,861
Just hold me right there
and you take my hand.

1172
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:19,439
Oh, God! I sat on my nuts.

1173
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,937
I'm gonna build the next one
for comfort, don't you worry.

1174
01:26:30,434 --> 01:26:31,860
Open the door.

1175
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,102
Sorry sir,
if you'd just give me a moment?

1176
01:26:33,103 --> 01:26:34,444
Open the door!

1177
01:26:35,367 --> 01:26:36,273
You ready?

1178
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:37,648
The name in the middle
of that steering wheel

1179
01:26:37,649 --> 01:26:39,904
should tell you that I was born
ready, Shelby.

1180
01:26:39,904 --> 01:26:41,687
- Hit it.
- Attaboy.

1181
01:26:44,823 --> 01:26:45,975
Oh, that's got a little...

1182
01:26:45,976 --> 01:26:46,976
kick... doesn't it?

1183
01:26:47,637 --> 01:26:49,601
- Open the door!
- Here we go.

1184
01:26:49,602 --> 01:26:52,267
Good God, Mr. Beebe.
Are you okay, sir?

1185
01:26:54,648 --> 01:26:56,301
Oh my God!

1186
01:26:57,463 --> 01:27:00,293
Oh my God!

1187
01:27:03,294 --> 01:27:05,394
Yeah, baby!

1188
01:27:11,222 --> 01:27:15,444
It's about right now they uninitiated
have a tendency to soil themselves.

1189
01:28:01,658 --> 01:28:03,051
Mr. Ford.

1190
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:08,266
Are you okay?

1191
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:14,373
Mr. Ford, You all right?

1192
01:28:14,374 --> 01:28:16,434
I had no idea.

1193
01:28:18,488 --> 01:28:20,224
I had no idea.

1194
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:26,370
I wish my daddy, he
were alive to see this.

1195
01:28:28,044 --> 01:28:29,873
To feel this.

1196
01:28:31,093 --> 01:28:34,300
This is not a machine just anybody
can get in and easily control.

1197
01:28:34,301 --> 01:28:37,646
Absolutely not. I had no idea.

1198
01:28:37,647 --> 01:28:39,216
Now you wanna win Le Mans.

1199
01:28:39,811 --> 01:28:43,277
You really wanna take 1st place,
Ken Miles is the man to do it.

1200
01:28:51,937 --> 01:28:53,496
Good timing.

1201
01:28:53,732 --> 01:28:56,414
He knows this car
because he helped me build it.

1202
01:28:57,651 --> 01:29:01,844
Shelby, you know I've already appointed
Leo Beebe Director of...

1203
01:29:01,845 --> 01:29:04,317
Which is exactly
why I'm talking to you.

1204
01:29:05,102 --> 01:29:07,889
You let Ken Miles race Daytona.

1205
01:29:08,323 --> 01:29:09,717
If he wins,

1206
01:29:10,783 --> 01:29:12,716
he gets to drive Le Mans.

1207
01:29:14,989 --> 01:29:16,443
And if he doesn't?

1208
01:29:17,254 --> 01:29:20,741
Ford Motor Company gets full ownership
of Shelby American.

1209
01:29:20,851 --> 01:29:23,572
Lock, stock and brand. Forever.

1210
01:29:26,843 --> 01:29:29,461
<i>We're an hour of 6 at the Daytona 24.</i>

1211
01:29:29,618 --> 01:29:32,227
<i>And Fords are dominating the leaderboard.</i>

1212
01:29:33,077 --> 01:29:36,350
<i>Shelby American's Ken Miles
holds a narrow lead over</i>

1213
01:29:36,351 --> 01:29:39,415
<i>the Holman Moody Ford,
driven by Walt Hansgen.</i>

1214
01:29:40,202 --> 01:29:42,216
I don't bloody think so, Walt.

1215
01:30:01,299 --> 01:30:05,555
This race is not just a test of our cars,
but also our teams.

1216
01:30:05,556 --> 01:30:07,688
As you know we have a second team
out there today.

1217
01:30:07,689 --> 01:30:09,428
- Holman Moody?
- That's right.

1218
01:30:15,117 --> 01:30:16,697
Walt's pushing it too fast.

1219
01:30:16,698 --> 01:30:20,461
He's pushing 7000 RPM!
Get the EZ sign out there.

1220
01:30:20,461 --> 01:30:22,261
Come on. Move! Do it now!

1221
01:30:22,262 --> 01:30:26,300
Every one of these GTs out there today
is under my direct supervision.

1222
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:29,228
And, of course, the supervision
of Henry Ford II.

1223
01:30:29,229 --> 01:30:32,677
The drivers, the speed, the strategy

1224
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:35,586
even the RPMs are determined by us.

1225
01:30:39,182 --> 01:30:41,917
<i>Ken Miles is locked in a
pitched battle with Hansgen</i>

1226
01:30:41,918 --> 01:30:43,729
<i>as they pass the grandstand.</i>

1227
01:30:47,231 --> 01:30:50,612
<i>Hansgen is taking a run at
Miles into turn one.</i>

1228
01:30:53,209 --> 01:30:54,607
<i>Hansgen takes the lead...</i>

1229
01:31:05,768 --> 01:31:08,262
Oh, blimey! Did you see that?

1230
01:31:16,367 --> 01:31:17,609
Still racing.

1231
01:31:17,938 --> 01:31:20,112
- Hey, we are still racing!
- Come on, guys! Let's go!

1232
01:31:20,113 --> 01:31:22,096
- Let's go! Move it!
- He's coming in!

1233
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:25,015
Let's go! Let's go, guys!
Come on!

1234
01:31:27,284 --> 01:31:28,801
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

1235
01:31:33,934 --> 01:31:36,257
Hansgen is right up our arse.

1236
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:38,090
If I can get outta the pit
ahead of him.

1237
01:31:38,091 --> 01:31:40,838
She's running hot but
I think she'll hold.

1238
01:31:42,252 --> 01:31:43,943
She's hot.

1239
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:47,927
Hey, Walt. Good to see you.

1240
01:31:47,927 --> 01:31:50,550
After I get out of this pit, Shelby.
It's the last time you will.

1241
01:31:50,551 --> 01:31:53,222
Aw, don't worry,
we've got rear view mirrors.

1242
01:31:54,357 --> 01:31:56,278
What happened to that Mustang
he took out?

1243
01:31:56,643 --> 01:31:58,011
Don't know yet.

1244
01:31:58,318 --> 01:32:02,607
I can push her harder than 6, Shel.
I can feel it.

1245
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:11,076
How come these guys's pit
so much faster than we do?

1246
01:32:11,191 --> 01:32:14,398
They got a goddamn
NASCAR crew, that's why.

1247
01:32:14,859 --> 01:32:16,793
- No shit?
- No shit.

1248
01:32:22,066 --> 01:32:23,991
Goddamn NASCAR crew.

1249
01:32:25,502 --> 01:32:27,037
Guys, they've already left!

1250
01:32:29,792 --> 01:32:30,792
Hello?

1251
01:32:30,901 --> 01:32:32,960
<i>That's my Mollie, hello.</i>

1252
01:32:33,539 --> 01:32:34,759
Hiya, love.

1253
01:32:34,987 --> 01:32:36,549
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- Mom, mom.

1254
01:32:36,998 --> 01:32:39,405
- Just having a cuppa.
- Mom, ask him about the brakes!

1255
01:32:39,406 --> 01:32:41,227
Go to bed, it's 1 AM.

1256
01:32:41,227 --> 01:32:43,189
- Ask him.
- Go to bed! Now!

1257
01:32:43,768 --> 01:32:45,307
I take it he's not asleep.

1258
01:32:45,308 --> 01:32:47,282
<i>I'm sure he smuggled in a radio.</i>

1259
01:32:48,604 --> 01:32:50,014
He said to ask how are the brakes.

1260
01:32:50,015 --> 01:32:54,156
The brakes, yes.
No, no, tell him they're working, for now.

1261
01:32:54,393 --> 01:32:56,630
You know,
Shelby's been acting very strange.

1262
01:32:57,389 --> 01:32:58,518
<i>- Ford's gonna...</i>
- Ken.

1263
01:32:58,518 --> 01:33:00,705
<i>push up another team with a GT.</i>

1264
01:33:00,705 --> 01:33:04,398
<i>Some sort of a yampy bloody corporate test
or something, I don't know but...</i>

1265
01:33:04,398 --> 01:33:06,627
Take a rest whenever you get a chance.

1266
01:33:06,627 --> 01:33:08,129
<i>Sorry, my love. What you were saying?</i>

1267
01:33:08,129 --> 01:33:09,631
You've only got a few hours.

1268
01:33:09,632 --> 01:33:13,410
I can't hear you very well.
I'm sorry, I can't hear ya. Wish me luck.

1269
01:33:13,559 --> 01:33:15,569
- Good luck.
- I love you, darling.

1270
01:33:15,995 --> 01:33:18,180
<i>After 23 hours here at Daytona,</i>

1271
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:20,641
<i>Walt Hansgen,
driving a green and white Ford</i>

1272
01:33:20,641 --> 01:33:25,175
<i>has a commanding lead
over Ken Miles and Shelby American.</i>

1273
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:31,134
We're locked out, ain't nothing
Miles can do this late in the race.

1274
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:34,975
Engine's hot,
we gotta keep it under 6 thou'.

1275
01:34:22,528 --> 01:34:24,492
Alright.

1276
01:34:49,202 --> 01:34:50,963
She could come apart.

1277
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,693
One way to find out.

1278
01:34:55,632 --> 01:34:58,341
I thought we were keeping
him under 6000.

1279
01:34:58,341 --> 01:34:59,898
Shut up, Don.

1280
01:35:09,452 --> 01:35:11,725
<i>We've only minutes of racing
left here at Daytona,</i>

1281
01:35:11,726 --> 01:35:13,879
<i>a pitched battle for the
lead is being raised</i>

1282
01:35:13,879 --> 01:35:16,885
<i>as the #98 Ford makes an
incredible late surge.</i>

1283
01:35:16,886 --> 01:35:19,497
- What's happening?
- He's moving up.

1284
01:35:19,949 --> 01:35:22,496
<i>Ken Miles' desperate bid for the win...</i>

1285
01:35:32,215 --> 01:35:34,400
White flag, last lap!

1286
01:35:39,663 --> 01:35:41,999
Miles is pushing him, hard.

1287
01:35:52,443 --> 01:35:53,902
That's it.

1288
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:07,887
<i>Ken Miles drafts Walt Hansgen
coming in to the final turn.</i>

1289
01:36:34,502 --> 01:36:35,776
Come on, come on!

1290
01:36:39,469 --> 01:36:41,047
What the hell?

1291
01:36:48,849 --> 01:36:50,022
Come on!

1292
01:36:50,699 --> 01:36:52,518
Alright.

1293
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:58,070
Look at this now.

1294
01:37:02,795 --> 01:37:03,938
Damn it!

1295
01:37:20,799 --> 01:37:22,469
How about that?

1296
01:37:33,813 --> 01:37:34,719
Yes, Leo?

1297
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:37,232
Mr. Ford, sir. We won.

1298
01:37:38,855 --> 01:37:41,205
We won. Ford won Daytona.

1299
01:37:42,987 --> 01:37:45,145
And which team was it, Leo?

1300
01:37:46,015 --> 01:37:48,968
Shelby American, Miles driving.

1301
01:37:50,417 --> 01:37:52,121
Son of a bitch.

1302
01:37:54,258 --> 01:37:57,618
Where the hell is he?
Hang on, wait a minute.

1303
01:37:57,986 --> 01:38:00,707
Someone lost a bulldog on the beach!

1304
01:38:01,493 --> 01:38:03,769
No, no. Come on, Come on.

1305
01:38:07,482 --> 01:38:09,436
Someone get this man a drink.

1306
01:38:25,835 --> 01:38:26,835
Oi!

1307
01:38:28,136 --> 01:38:30,538
In bed you!
What are you doing?

1308
01:38:30,919 --> 01:38:32,705
Dirty stop out.

1309
01:38:33,136 --> 01:38:38,040
I was drawing a map,
so I could follow you at Le Mans.

1310
01:38:42,155 --> 01:38:43,706
Look at that.

1311
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,339
That is spot on.

1312
01:38:46,869 --> 01:38:48,971
You are a dab hand,
very accurate.

1313
01:38:50,407 --> 01:38:53,607
- Tell me about the track.
- No, I can't, Petey.

1314
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:55,799
Please.

1315
01:39:03,989 --> 01:39:06,180
We start at the start line.

1316
01:39:06,894 --> 01:39:10,469
You actually start here, because you
have to run to your car at Le Mans.

1317
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:11,740
True enough.

1318
01:39:12,647 --> 01:39:16,912
Once your old man
manages to hobble over and pull out.

1319
01:39:17,218 --> 01:39:19,475
- And not hit anyone.
- Yes, right.

1320
01:39:21,151 --> 01:39:25,209
Accelerate, very hard up to Dunlop bridge.

1321
01:39:25,664 --> 01:39:30,113
Road banking away from you.
Then down through the trees to the Esses.

1322
01:39:30,436 --> 01:39:35,025
Accelerate up to Terte Rouge,
critical first gear corner.

1323
01:39:35,444 --> 01:39:42,194
Fast entry, keep your speed up
for your exit onto Mulsanne.

1324
01:39:42,564 --> 01:39:46,529
Long straight-away,
hemmed in by poplars, Top gear.

1325
01:39:46,985 --> 01:39:52,996
210 mph, then down to third,
revs up, revs are your friend.

1326
01:39:53,555 --> 01:39:59,069
Get a maximum exit,
Let the car run free, Over the brow

1327
01:39:59,358 --> 01:40:05,963
then wham, the Mulsanne Corner,
Accelerate to Arnage.

1328
01:40:06,232 --> 01:40:09,906
Over the rise to the White House.
You get that right and

1329
01:40:12,837 --> 01:40:18,007
your first 3.5 minutes of the 24 hours.

1330
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:19,930
But...

1331
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:24,940
You can't make every lap perfect.

1332
01:40:26,117 --> 01:40:28,193
But I can try.

1333
01:40:33,426 --> 01:40:36,751
Alright, off to bed you.

1334
01:40:39,916 --> 01:40:45,378
I will wake you before
I leave for France.

1335
01:40:45,612 --> 01:40:47,156
I promise.

1336
01:40:47,329 --> 01:40:49,826
Okay, goodnight.

1337
01:41:19,781 --> 01:41:22,196
Where is that? Hotel Champier?

1338
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:25,402
Where?

1339
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:13,706
It's gonna rain again tomorrow.

1340
01:42:18,756 --> 01:42:20,577
There's always rain here.

1341
01:42:23,429 --> 01:42:25,426
Start will be dry, though.

1342
01:42:26,582 --> 01:42:28,890
We'll swap out your tires come rain.

1343
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:32,781
Yeah.

1344
01:42:35,701 --> 01:42:39,483
Might be smart to sleep, bulldog.

1345
01:42:41,312 --> 01:42:42,873
You too.

1346
01:42:43,668 --> 01:42:45,510
I'm not driving.

1347
01:42:47,989 --> 01:42:50,866
That's a bloody shame, that.

1348
01:42:51,234 --> 01:42:53,645
Oh hell, I couldn't make this team.

1349
01:42:58,272 --> 01:43:00,473
I'm gonna walk the first corner.

1350
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:03,839
Now I figured.

1351
01:43:14,332 --> 01:43:16,147
Counting on it.

1352
01:43:50,007 --> 01:43:51,289
Hey, Ken.

1353
01:43:51,461 --> 01:43:52,908
Chaz.

1354
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:11,346
<i>If this were a beauty pageant,
we just lost.</i>

1355
01:44:12,503 --> 01:44:13,966
Looks fast, doesn't it?

1356
01:44:14,415 --> 01:44:16,379
Looks aren't everything.

1357
01:44:20,374 --> 01:44:23,431
Scarfiotti and Bandini
start for Ferrari.

1358
01:44:29,117 --> 01:44:30,150
You can take him.

1359
01:44:30,151 --> 01:44:32,470
<i>4 minutes, Ken.
4 minutes, buddy.</i>

1360
01:44:32,649 --> 01:44:35,617
<i>- Live from Le Mans, France.</i>
- Mom! Come on!

1361
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:38,106
Alright, I'm coming.

1362
01:44:38,418 --> 01:44:40,766
<i>The 24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

1363
01:44:46,066 --> 01:44:48,470
<i>Drivers, please take your places.</i>

1364
01:45:07,013 --> 01:45:10,156
- There he is.
<i>- And here they are lined up, ready to go.</i>

1365
01:46:03,514 --> 01:46:04,959
Bloody joking!

1366
01:46:14,092 --> 01:46:15,432
It's all right, son.

1367
01:46:18,178 --> 01:46:20,148
You looked great out there, sir.

1368
01:46:20,798 --> 01:46:22,374
What happened to Miles?

1369
01:46:30,988 --> 01:46:32,757
Bloody hell!

1370
01:46:43,316 --> 01:46:44,531
Poxy bastard!

1371
01:47:20,254 --> 01:47:23,911
<i>After one lap, Bandini,
Ferrari is in first place.</i>

1372
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:29,634
Where's Miles?

1373
01:47:31,641 --> 01:47:33,862
- Where the hell is Ken?
- I don't know.

1374
01:47:42,947 --> 01:47:45,501
He's coming in.

1375
01:47:45,502 --> 01:47:48,151
Let's go! Faster! Come on!
Let's Go! Move it!

1376
01:47:48,491 --> 01:47:50,194
I think it's his door.

1377
01:47:50,195 --> 01:47:52,364
<i>That's a rough start for the Ford team.</i>

1378
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:58,929
The bloody door won't close!

1379
01:47:58,930 --> 01:48:01,197
- Alright, alright.
<i>- Maybe it's the heat.</i>

1380
01:48:04,196 --> 01:48:05,052
Try that.

1381
01:48:05,053 --> 01:48:07,261
Shelby! What the hell is wrong?

1382
01:48:08,138 --> 01:48:11,178
<i>- Something's hitting the frame.</i>
- Oh, you're joking, aren't you?

1383
01:48:11,561 --> 01:48:13,200
Guys, get out of the way!

1384
01:48:13,346 --> 01:48:15,043
Get out of the way! Hold.

1385
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:17,962
Go, go, go!

1386
01:48:26,210 --> 01:48:28,182
He's back out, go!

1387
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:57,777
<i>Tremendous gains for Ken Miles and Ford...</i>

1388
01:48:57,778 --> 01:49:00,520
Come on dad, come on.

1389
01:49:08,752 --> 01:49:11,455
<i>Ken Miles, Ford, has set a new lap record,</i>

1390
01:49:11,455 --> 01:49:13,618
<i>3 minutes and 34 seconds.</i>

1391
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:33,742
Shelby, he's pushing the car too hard.
That's not the plan.

1392
01:49:34,626 --> 01:49:36,190
Plan's changed.

1393
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:06,873
Lap is 3.34, track is 8.36.

1394
01:50:06,873 --> 01:50:09,219
Someone tell me the mph!

1395
01:50:18,033 --> 01:50:20,130
<i>3:31.9 that's a...</i>

1396
01:50:20,131 --> 01:50:21,786
Another lap record.

1397
01:50:27,377 --> 01:50:29,021
Let's go, let's go, boys!

1398
01:50:29,565 --> 01:50:32,323
- Tea's ready, Ken.
- Thank you, Chaz.

1399
01:50:32,726 --> 01:50:35,873
- Happy Birthday, old chap.
- Cheers, mate. Great run.

1400
01:50:44,976 --> 01:50:46,776
You're 3 seconds
faster than Gurney.

1401
01:50:46,892 --> 01:50:49,329
If you hadn't blown the
start you'd be in the lead.

1402
01:50:49,413 --> 01:50:52,123
- Can you keep this up?
- Can the car?

1403
01:50:54,527 --> 01:50:59,487
<i>There has been an incident on turn 6.
#18 and #26 have collided.</i>

1404
01:51:24,643 --> 01:51:27,915
<i>It appears, Ferrari, #20,
Ludovico Scarfiotti</i>

1405
01:51:27,916 --> 01:51:29,916
<i>has also left the track.</i>

1406
01:51:39,079 --> 01:51:41,907
- All right, watch your head.
- Thank you.

1407
01:51:42,156 --> 01:51:44,162
Have a good dinner, sir.

1408
01:51:44,729 --> 01:51:46,623
Oi, McLaren's pitting.

1409
01:51:50,202 --> 01:51:52,501
Mr. Ford's probably going
somewhere nice for dinner.

1410
01:51:52,502 --> 01:51:54,414
What do you mean 'probably'?

1411
01:51:54,415 --> 01:51:55,739
Rain's coming.

1412
01:51:55,909 --> 01:51:57,160
Alright.

1413
01:52:12,887 --> 01:52:14,392
Coming in.

1414
01:52:22,825 --> 01:52:24,989
- Engine's running hot, Pops.
- Alright.

1415
01:52:25,152 --> 01:52:26,681
She's hot, mate. Crack on.

1416
01:52:29,691 --> 01:52:30,998
Tire.

1417
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:40,529
- We're at 220. We're okay.
- Alright.

1418
01:52:44,739 --> 01:52:46,644
- Let's go.
- Swap that out.

1419
01:52:57,635 --> 01:52:58,990
Go! Go!

1420
01:53:06,453 --> 01:53:08,035
Hey, I need a stopwatch.

1421
01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:42,285
<i>Lorenzo Bandini remains
in first place for Ferrari.</i>

1422
01:53:56,806 --> 01:53:58,852
Easy, Dan. You're getting boxed in.

1423
01:53:58,853 --> 01:54:00,877
He's not batting
on a full wicket, that one.

1424
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:08,493
Easy, Dan.

1425
01:54:09,912 --> 01:54:11,514
Oh bloody hell!

1426
01:54:12,756 --> 01:54:14,797
You arsehole!

1427
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:33,298
Oh, piss off!

1428
01:54:35,731 --> 01:54:37,274
You wanker!

1429
01:54:44,286 --> 01:54:47,078
Face like a sprat arse, don't ya?

1430
01:55:00,537 --> 01:55:04,766
<i>Porsche #58 with an unidentified Ford
are run off the track,</i>

1431
01:55:04,767 --> 01:55:05,767
<i>at Arnarge.</i>

1432
01:55:16,672 --> 01:55:18,455
Nice stopwatch.

1433
01:55:18,835 --> 01:55:20,925
You want one? They're Italian.

1434
01:55:43,782 --> 01:55:47,222
<i>Ken Miles in Ford #1,
and Bandini in Ferrari 21</i>

1435
01:55:47,222 --> 01:55:48,776
<i>are locked in a battle
against the elements</i>

1436
01:55:48,777 --> 01:55:50,778
<i>as they push their cars to the limit.</i>

1437
01:55:50,779 --> 01:55:52,677
<i>Past the White House corner.</i>

1438
01:56:00,941 --> 01:56:03,944
Yes, sir? Yes, sir.

1439
01:56:06,737 --> 01:56:08,425
Okay, sir. Right away, sir.

1440
01:56:15,217 --> 01:56:16,485
Hey!

1441
01:56:18,707 --> 01:56:20,161
Give me that.

1442
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:23,617
Dumbass.

1443
01:56:23,618 --> 01:56:25,120
Mr. Shelby.

1444
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:09,011
Here we go.

1445
01:57:12,322 --> 01:57:14,425
Come on, girl. Come on.

1446
01:57:20,405 --> 01:57:22,441
Hold it together now.

1447
01:57:40,795 --> 01:57:41,650
Come on!

1448
01:57:41,656 --> 01:57:46,697
<i>Leader at this moment is Ferrari #21,
being driven by Lorenzo Bandini.</i>

1449
01:57:46,698 --> 01:57:49,310
His brakes are shot.
Alright, here we go.

1450
01:57:49,429 --> 01:57:53,950
<i>It looks like Ken Miles is bringing
the #1 Ford into the pits very slowly.</i>

1451
01:57:57,478 --> 01:58:00,114
Brakes! Nothing! Gone!

1452
01:58:00,418 --> 01:58:02,323
Alright. Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1453
01:58:03,912 --> 01:58:06,683
I had him, I almost had him!

1454
01:58:08,528 --> 01:58:10,951
Well, he's putting another
lap on us now.

1455
01:58:14,753 --> 01:58:16,500
Now, now! Faster!

1456
01:58:20,634 --> 01:58:22,634
They're doing it! The brakes!

1457
01:58:25,468 --> 01:58:27,266
Faster, faster!

1458
01:58:46,359 --> 01:58:49,215
Against the rules.
You can't just change things.

1459
01:58:49,216 --> 01:58:50,220
Oh, no, no, no.

1460
01:58:50,221 --> 01:58:52,072
You show me where it says in your book

1461
01:58:52,073 --> 01:58:56,437
that we cannot swap out the system
and then you can disqualify us.

1462
01:58:56,438 --> 01:58:58,349
- This is not legal.
- Calm down, calm down.

1463
01:58:58,350 --> 01:58:59,183
This is not legal.

1464
01:58:59,184 --> 01:59:01,497
You show me where it
says in that little rule book

1465
01:59:01,498 --> 01:59:03,767
where I can't swap out
my upright assembly.

1466
01:59:03,767 --> 01:59:04,893
A part is a part.

1467
01:59:04,893 --> 01:59:06,972
Be it a brake caliper or a rotor
or an upright assembly

1468
01:59:06,973 --> 01:59:08,978
and I can swap out
any damn thing I want to.

1469
01:59:10,137 --> 01:59:11,897
We read your damn rule book.

1470
01:59:17,712 --> 01:59:20,044
Bandini's pitting, He's pitting!

1471
01:59:27,361 --> 01:59:29,919
Oh, what a shame. I think he blew a line.

1472
01:59:29,919 --> 01:59:32,249
Well, he was trying to
keep up with you.

1473
01:59:41,748 --> 01:59:44,101
I don't speak Italian,
but he ain't happy.

1474
01:59:55,366 --> 01:59:57,946
Get me out of here, Pops.
Come on!

1475
01:59:58,978 --> 02:00:00,511
Almost set, Ken.

1476
02:00:04,133 --> 02:00:05,537
All yours, Ken.

1477
02:00:05,537 --> 02:00:08,320
Alright listen, you can still take
him, but you gotta pass him twice.

1478
02:00:08,321 --> 02:00:10,455
I get it, pass him twice.

1479
02:00:17,395 --> 02:00:22,790
<i>Ford #1, driven by Ken Miles is back out.
Hot on the heels of Bandini in Ferrari 21.</i>

1480
02:01:20,705 --> 02:01:23,810
Not bloody good enough Miles!
Come on!

1481
02:01:24,447 --> 02:01:26,243
He's off his pace.

1482
02:01:27,468 --> 02:01:29,505
He doesn't trust the car yet.

1483
02:01:29,907 --> 02:01:32,784
Come on, Ken.
I gave you new brakes, buddy.

1484
02:01:38,772 --> 02:01:40,321
Alright,

1485
02:01:41,615 --> 02:01:43,410
what did you come here for?

1486
02:01:45,762 --> 02:01:47,589
Let's do it.

1487
02:02:11,522 --> 02:02:13,390
That's it, come on!

1488
02:02:24,498 --> 02:02:26,221
He ain't done it yet.

1489
02:02:29,647 --> 02:02:31,308
He needs to take another lap on him.

1490
02:02:55,322 --> 02:02:59,351
- He needs to pit soon.
- He needs to catch Bandini first.

1491
02:03:09,809 --> 02:03:11,414
All right, you bastard.

1492
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:14,186
Let's do this again.

1493
02:03:43,578 --> 02:03:44,741
Come on, girl.

1494
02:03:45,284 --> 02:03:47,845
That's my girl, that's my girl!

1495
02:04:07,486 --> 02:04:10,232
Oh my God, Oh my God!

1496
02:04:10,755 --> 02:04:12,499
Bloody hell!

1497
02:04:25,955 --> 02:04:28,280
He did it. We're in the lead.

1498
02:04:28,605 --> 02:04:29,978
Are we in the lead?

1499
02:04:30,092 --> 02:04:31,825
What about Bandini?

1500
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:34,173
Where's Bandini?

1501
02:04:34,576 --> 02:04:38,126
He's done, finished. Ferrari's over.

1502
02:04:38,127 --> 02:04:40,254
McLaren's 4 minutes behind him in a GT.

1503
02:04:40,255 --> 02:04:44,146
So we're laying Ken first,
and 2 and 3. All Fords.

1504
02:05:05,961 --> 02:05:07,686
The Deuce is coming.

1505
02:05:16,361 --> 02:05:19,371
Ken's up in a half an hour.
Want me to wake him?

1506
02:05:19,372 --> 02:05:21,136
No, let him sleep.

1507
02:05:22,448 --> 02:05:24,285
- Unbelievable.
- Thank you.

1508
02:05:24,569 --> 02:05:26,524
- Good job.
- Not quite there yet, but...

1509
02:05:27,893 --> 02:05:29,570
There he is.

1510
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:33,115
Brief me, Leo.

1511
02:05:33,385 --> 02:05:35,736
We're running one, two, three, Mr. Ford.

1512
02:05:36,602 --> 02:05:39,032
- Who's in the lead?
- Him. Miles.

1513
02:05:41,877 --> 02:05:43,937
I was thinking, Mr. Ford.

1514
02:05:44,364 --> 02:05:47,458
Wouldn't it be great
if all three Fords lined up

1515
02:05:47,459 --> 02:05:50,498
across the finish line at
the exact same time?

1516
02:05:50,688 --> 02:05:52,768
They'll lined up and came home together.

1517
02:05:52,769 --> 02:05:55,439
Ford, Ford, Ford.

1518
02:05:55,896 --> 02:05:57,982
I don't think we can actually do that, sir.

1519
02:05:59,181 --> 02:06:00,594
Why not?

1520
02:06:01,277 --> 02:06:06,316
Miles is laps ahead, Leo.
What would you have him do, slow down?

1521
02:06:07,815 --> 02:06:09,375
Yeah.

1522
02:06:20,971 --> 02:06:22,892
He thinks it'll be
a historic moment for Ford,

1523
02:06:22,893 --> 02:06:24,464
it'll make a great photograph.

1524
02:06:26,279 --> 02:06:28,782
Shelby, Miles needs to be
a team player here.

1525
02:06:29,113 --> 02:06:30,282
And so do you.

1526
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,276
Are you gonna tell him or
you need me to?

1527
02:06:33,832 --> 02:06:36,321
Don't go near my driver. Go on.

1528
02:06:37,291 --> 02:06:39,873
- This is what Mr. Ford wants.
- Go on now.

1529
02:06:40,495 --> 02:06:42,535
- He expects loyalty.
- Go on.

1530
02:06:59,412 --> 02:07:03,008
Guys, let's go. 
Come on, let's go.

1531
02:07:06,911 --> 02:07:08,289
What'd Beebe want?

1532
02:07:14,244 --> 02:07:15,924
It's off the scale, isn't it?

1533
02:07:21,357 --> 02:07:23,491
They want you to slow down.

1534
02:07:27,259 --> 02:07:29,135
Run that by me again.

1535
02:07:29,384 --> 02:07:31,369
They want you to slow down.

1536
02:07:33,864 --> 02:07:36,952
You're outshining their car, Ken.
You're 4 minutes up on McLaren.

1537
02:07:36,953 --> 02:07:38,277
The Deuce wants the three Fords

1538
02:07:38,278 --> 02:07:40,893
across the finish line:
one, two, three, all together.

1539
02:07:46,598 --> 02:07:49,576
They're asking that you
be a team player.

1540
02:07:50,359 --> 02:07:52,231
And make that photograph
happen for 'em.

1541
02:07:52,232 --> 02:07:55,921
A photograph, that's good.

1542
02:07:55,922 --> 02:07:58,422
That is good!

1543
02:08:00,561 --> 02:08:05,548
Ken, even if you tie for first,
you'd still be first man ever to win

1544
02:08:05,779 --> 02:08:08,708
Sebring, Daytona, Le Mans
in the same year.

1545
02:08:09,198 --> 02:08:11,311
You'll have a triple crown.

1546
02:08:17,695 --> 02:08:19,495
Look, I didn't get...

1547
02:08:20,896 --> 02:08:23,816
I haven't been able to get you
to follow an order since day one.

1548
02:08:24,174 --> 02:08:26,539
Whatever you wanna do
is fine with me.

1549
02:08:27,872 --> 02:08:29,659
My choice?

1550
02:08:30,747 --> 02:08:32,509
Your choice.

1551
02:08:38,694 --> 02:08:42,349
Engine's running at boiling.
The brakes are shot.

1552
02:08:45,418 --> 02:08:46,907
How was that?

1553
02:08:48,245 --> 02:08:49,314
Taken care of.

1554
02:08:49,499 --> 02:08:53,007
The car is yours, Ken.
Ken, the car is yours.

1555
02:08:54,632 --> 02:08:56,655
Car is yours, Ken.

1556
02:09:29,485 --> 02:09:33,033
<i>It's the Fords that are the cars
to beat, claiming the top 3 positions.</i>

1557
02:09:33,034 --> 02:09:34,810
What the hell is he doing?

1558
02:09:39,709 --> 02:09:42,397
Don't answer that!
Get away from it!

1559
02:09:42,546 --> 02:09:44,160
Get away from it!

1560
02:10:10,842 --> 02:10:13,564
- He's gonna break his own record.
- Shut up!

1561
02:10:22,526 --> 02:10:24,170
Wait for it.

1562
02:10:25,791 --> 02:10:27,228
Wait for it.

1563
02:10:30,226 --> 02:10:31,350
Now.

1564
02:10:37,113 --> 02:10:39,685
Miles!

1565
02:11:15,056 --> 02:11:16,813
Bellissimo.

1566
02:11:16,935 --> 02:11:20,449
3:30.6.
That's another record.

1567
02:11:26,116 --> 02:11:28,335
That's a perfect lap.

1568
02:11:28,336 --> 02:11:30,218
<i>And virtually guaranteeing 1st place</i>

1569
02:11:30,219 --> 02:11:33,695
<i>for Shelby American and
their exciting GT-40</i>

1570
02:11:33,828 --> 02:11:41,046
<i>Ken Miles and Shelby American's Ford #1
just beat his own lap record, 3:30.6.</i>

1571
02:11:41,047 --> 02:11:44,039
Bring him in, right now!
He's outta control!

1572
02:11:44,487 --> 02:11:47,570
Bring him in before he wrecks that car
and we don't finish!

1573
02:11:49,765 --> 02:11:51,121
Bring him in, Shelby!

1574
02:11:51,274 --> 02:11:54,438
Or I will get you banned
from the SCCA and the FIA.

1575
02:11:55,898 --> 02:12:00,112
Ken Miles is behind the wheel, Leo.
That's his car to the finish.

1576
02:12:01,652 --> 02:12:10,413
<i>H-a-p-p-y, I'm h-a-p-p-y,
I know I am, I'm sure I am...</i>

1577
02:13:35,184 --> 02:13:37,425
Come on, lads. Where are ya?

1578
02:13:48,122 --> 02:13:49,779
What's he doing?

1579
02:13:50,358 --> 02:13:52,669
Mom, why is he slowing down?

1580
02:14:24,295 --> 02:14:26,735
The three Fords are going to
cross the line together.

1581
02:14:26,999 --> 02:14:29,167
Ken Miles slowed down.
He waited for them.

1582
02:14:29,401 --> 02:14:31,927
Dad? No.

1583
02:14:32,062 --> 02:14:32,994
- It's Alright.
- Dad.

1584
02:14:32,995 --> 02:14:35,394
It's Alright. He's bringing them in.

1585
02:14:35,395 --> 02:14:36,455
<i>...lead by Ken Miles...</i>

1586
02:14:36,456 --> 02:14:39,616
<i>- He's bringing them all in together.
- He's certainly the leader of this group.</i>

1587
02:14:40,375 --> 02:14:42,014
Good for you.

1588
02:14:42,647 --> 02:14:44,382
Good for you, Ken.

1589
02:15:11,653 --> 02:15:13,417
Look at that!

1590
02:15:15,170 --> 02:15:16,767
Well done, Leo.

1591
02:15:16,768 --> 02:15:17,768
You too, John.

1592
02:15:37,084 --> 02:15:40,415
<i>Explain to me how he's finished first
if he's not won the race?</i>

1593
02:15:40,415 --> 02:15:44,534
<i>Because McLaren started from further,
so he came into and he won.</i>

1594
02:15:44,534 --> 02:15:46,035
It's not a tie!

1595
02:15:46,361 --> 02:15:48,684
Because McLaren started further
back, they're saying.

1596
02:15:48,685 --> 02:15:51,409
He's traveled a little bit further.
So, he's won and not Ken.

1597
02:15:51,410 --> 02:15:53,188
That's bullshit!

1598
02:15:53,328 --> 02:15:55,306
Shel, hold on!

1599
02:16:09,349 --> 02:16:12,149
Where is the tie?
Where is the goddamn tie?

1600
02:16:12,273 --> 02:16:13,273
What?

1601
02:16:13,494 --> 02:16:14,494
You son of a bitch!

1602
02:16:15,006 --> 02:16:16,357
- You knew!
- I didn't, I swear.

1603
02:16:16,358 --> 02:16:17,856
Enough!

1604
02:16:20,374 --> 02:16:22,627
Nice race, mate. Congrats.

1605
02:16:44,356 --> 02:16:46,048
Shel!

1606
02:16:49,992 --> 02:16:51,690
They robbed you, Ken.

1607
02:16:51,691 --> 02:16:56,153
<i>Here's the clarification, though the
drivers finished the race in a heat,</i>

1608
02:16:56,153 --> 02:16:59,624
<i>McLaren has been ruled the winner
as he started from farther back.</i>

1609
02:16:59,625 --> 02:17:02,153
Some bullshit technicality.

1610
02:17:15,321 --> 02:17:17,362
I never should've asked you.

1611
02:17:22,981 --> 02:17:25,132
Selling cars, huh?

1612
02:17:27,412 --> 02:17:29,168
That's what they do.

1613
02:17:29,757 --> 02:17:30,655
Well,

1614
02:17:31,221 --> 02:17:33,694
you promised me the drive,

1615
02:17:35,833 --> 02:17:37,797
not the win.

1616
02:17:38,297 --> 02:17:40,396
It was a hell of a drive.

1617
02:17:40,922 --> 02:17:42,850
She's a hell of a machine.

1618
02:17:43,308 --> 02:17:45,002
She's fast.

1619
02:17:46,437 --> 02:17:48,209
Could be faster.

1620
02:17:49,754 --> 02:17:51,810
The 7 liter's sweet.

1621
02:17:54,087 --> 02:17:59,592
We still need a lighter chassis.
I was thinking bonded aluminum.

1622
02:17:59,688 --> 02:18:05,546
It's a ground up rebuild, but if it works
we can lose a couple of hundred pounds.

1623
02:18:05,694 --> 02:18:07,712
What the hell are we doing here?

1624
02:18:09,036 --> 02:18:11,436
Let me take a shower,
get a cup of tea.

1625
02:18:11,585 --> 02:18:13,343
Ham and cheese cob or something.

1626
02:18:13,965 --> 02:18:16,363
We gonna get the bastards next year.

1627
02:18:40,068 --> 02:18:42,628
Got a bit of fuel left in the tank.

1628
02:18:43,581 --> 02:18:47,542
What do you think of those honeycomb
panels. What you were looking for?

1629
02:18:47,543 --> 02:18:49,920
I don't know yet.

1630
02:19:14,294 --> 02:19:16,734
She looks pretty good.

1631
02:19:26,375 --> 02:19:30,131
<i>There's a point at 7000 RPM</i>

1632
02:19:31,252 --> 02:19:33,867
<i>where everything fades.</i>

1633
02:19:35,858 --> 02:19:40,932
<i>The machine becomes
weightless, Just disappears.</i>

1634
02:19:42,350 --> 02:19:47,425
<i>And all that's left is a body
moving through space and time.</i>

1635
02:19:50,182 --> 02:19:55,410
<i>7000 RPM, that's where you need it.</i>

1636
02:19:56,818 --> 02:20:01,586
<i>You feel it coming.
It creeps up on you, close in your ear,</i>

1637
02:20:09,107 --> 02:20:13,926
<i>and asks you a question.
The only question that matters.</i>

1638
02:20:19,394 --> 02:20:20,662
<i>Get the van!</i>

1639
02:20:21,984 --> 02:20:24,143
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

1640
02:20:57,191 --> 02:20:58,281
What do you think?

1641
02:20:58,282 --> 02:21:02,918
It's fantastic! That was really good.
Nice and smooth.

1642
02:21:03,886 --> 02:21:06,145
No vibration in the box.
It was really strong.

1643
02:21:06,146 --> 02:21:10,711
You drove her for less than an hour,
you can't tell shit after an hour.

1644
02:21:14,003 --> 02:21:15,936
Hey, Shel.

1645
02:21:25,303 --> 02:21:30,956
Hey, Shell. That guy, the one in the hat.
He's ready to close on those two 427's.

1646
02:21:30,956 --> 02:21:36,977
His and hers, full freight.
They flew in from Galveston.

1647
02:21:40,759 --> 02:21:43,883
I need you to come outside
for maybe a minute.

1648
02:21:44,339 --> 02:21:46,148
And do what?

1649
02:21:47,442 --> 02:21:49,453
Be Carroll Shelby.

1650
02:21:49,963 --> 02:21:52,823
Tell them a story.
Spin a few magic words.

1651
02:21:53,215 --> 02:21:56,233
What does that mean?
Magic words?

1652
02:21:57,209 --> 02:22:00,896
It means, come
outside, and say hello,

1653
02:22:00,897 --> 02:22:02,921
and make them feel good
about their purchase.

1654
02:22:02,930 --> 02:22:06,406
They're getting the damn cars.
That's what they get for their money, Phil.

1655
02:22:06,532 --> 02:22:09,336
Either they want them or they don't.
Am I some kind of a lounge act?!

1656
02:22:09,336 --> 02:22:12,286
- No.
- Am I here to talk people into things?!

1657
02:22:23,092 --> 02:22:25,590
It's been 6 months, Shel.

1658
02:22:26,407 --> 02:22:28,489
Six months.

1659
02:22:32,472 --> 02:22:35,319
Sometimes, they don't get
out of the car.

1660
02:23:10,146 --> 02:23:11,993
Peter!

1661
02:23:12,446 --> 02:23:15,028
Peter, come and take
the garbage out!

1662
02:23:15,029 --> 02:23:17,193
<i>Mr. Shelby?</i>

1663
02:23:18,193 --> 02:23:19,761
Hello, Pete.

1664
02:23:21,434 --> 02:23:23,490
I remember that wrench.

1665
02:23:24,222 --> 02:23:26,043
My Dad threw it at you.

1666
02:23:27,312 --> 02:23:29,077
I believe he did.

1667
02:23:29,512 --> 02:23:30,803
Why?

1668
02:23:33,286 --> 02:23:34,387
Oh.

1669
02:23:35,646 --> 02:23:38,116
I think I probably
said something to him.

1670
02:23:38,755 --> 02:23:40,538
Called him a few names.

1671
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:44,114
That's right.

1672
02:23:52,582 --> 02:23:54,757
Do you wanna speak to my Mum?

1673
02:23:54,882 --> 02:24:00,158
Well, I did. I came to say hello,
check in on her and

1674
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:07,438
then, I started thinking sometimes

1675
02:24:09,235 --> 02:24:16,157
that words just are not useful.

1676
02:24:21,866 --> 02:24:24,445
Tools are useful 'cause you
can make stuff with 'em,

1677
02:24:24,446 --> 02:24:26,470
and you can fix stuff with 'em.

1678
02:24:27,491 --> 02:24:28,984
Here.

1679
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:31,581
Thanks.

1680
02:24:39,714 --> 02:24:42,218
Your Daddy was a...

1681
02:24:44,875 --> 02:24:47,334
He was your friend.

1682
02:24:52,752 --> 02:24:54,676
Yes, he was.

1683
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:57,182
Yes, sir.

1684
02:25:01,971 --> 02:25:05,406
And he thought you was
just finer than frog fur.

1685
02:25:09,293 --> 02:25:11,009
<i>Peter!</i>

1686
02:25:16,078 --> 02:25:18,546
I think I've gotta go help my Mum.

1687
02:25:20,281 --> 02:25:23,247
What are you doing
here then? Go on.

1688
02:25:23,603 --> 02:25:25,687
Bye.
