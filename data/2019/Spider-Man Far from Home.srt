1
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:11,780
Nick, this was a tragedy but
it's not why we're here.

2
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:14,257
What, are we fighting
the weather now?

3
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,897
The locals say the
cyclone had a face.

4
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,507
Well, people see things
when they're under stress.

5
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:23,522
Okay? That does not mean that this is
the start to some other, big world...

6
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:31,159
Who are you?

7
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:38,449
You don't want
any part of this.

8
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:25,739
-in memoriam-

9
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:56,024
Gone, but not forgotten.

10
00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:57,836
Thanks to Keneth Lim
and Vienna Hammarky

11
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:00,547
for their help with that
touching video tribute.

12
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:02,633
This year has been
nothing short of...

13
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:04,953
(Bleep)'s crazy.
It's like insane.

14
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:05,953
- Jason!
- What?

15
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:07,445
No swearing.

16
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:09,711
Nah, it's a scholastic school.
We're good.

17
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,423
Historic.

18
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:14,566
Over five years ago, half of
all life in the universe,

19
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:18,591
including our own Midtown High,
was wiped from existence.

20
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:22,903
But then, eight months ago, a band
of brave heroes brought us back.

21
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:26,778
They called it "The Blip".

22
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,730
Those of us who blipped away
came back the same age.

23
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,925
But our classmates that didn't
blip, had grown five years older.

24
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,707
Yeah, like my little brother?
He's now older than me.

25
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:38,254
Yeah, it's math.

26
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:40,917
And even though we had
blipped away halfway through

27
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:43,698
the school year and had
already taken midterms,

28
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:46,495
the school made us start the whole
year over from the beginning.

29
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,347
It's totally unfair.
It's not right.

30
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,955
Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic,
somewhat confusing road.

31
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:59,307
As we draw this year to a
close, it's time to move on.

32
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:02,128
To a new phase of our lives.

33
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,878
And pray nothing crazy
happens again, 'coz are

34
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:05,606
the Avengers, even
like, a thing anymore?

35
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:07,555
Does anyone even have a plan?

36
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:09,213
I have a plan. Okay...

37
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:11,183
First, I'm gonna sit next
to MJ on the flight.

38
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:11,767
Mm-hmm.

39
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,753
Second, I'm gonna buy a
dual headphone adapter

40
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:15,618
and watch movies with
her the whole time.

41
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:16,784
- Okay.
- Three...

42
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:19,918
When we go to Venice, Venice is super-famous
for making stuff out of glass, right?

43
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:21,043
- True.
- So, I'm gonna buy her

44
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:24,076
a Black Dahlia necklace because her
favorite flower is the Black Dahlia,

45
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,804
- because of, well...
- The murder.

46
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,022
The murder. Four...

47
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:30,048
When we go to Paris, I'm gonna take
her to the top of the Eiffel Tower,

48
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:32,263
give her the necklace,
and then, five...

49
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,154
I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

50
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:37,765
And then six, hopefully she tells
me, she feels the same way.

51
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:39,789
- Don't forget step seven.
- Step seven...

52
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,718
Don't do any of that.

53
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:43,251
Why?

54
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:45,307
Because we're gonna be
bachelors in Europe, Peter.

55
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,221
- Ned...
- Look, I may not know much,

56
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,626
but I do know this...

57
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:51,588
Europeans love Americans.

58
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:52,330
Really?

59
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:54,359
And more than half
of them are women!

60
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:56,532
Okay. Sure, but...

61
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,680
I really like MJ, man. Okay?

62
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:01,713
She's awesome, she's super-funny
in a kind of dork way

63
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:04,330
and sometimes I catch her looking at
me, and I feel like I stood up late...

64
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:05,681
Dude she's coming now.
Just don't say anything.

65
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:06,612
What up, dorks?

66
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:07,737
Excited about the science trip?

67
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:10,236
Hey, uh, yeah. We're just
talking about the trip.

68
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:12,926
- Yeah. And Peter's plan.
- You have a plan?

69
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:16,183
I don't have a plan.

70
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:20,574
No, he's just gonna collect tiny spoons
while we're travelling to other countries.

71
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:22,566
Like, like a grandmother?

72
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:25,289
I'm not collecting tiny spoons.
He's collecting tiny spoons.

73
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,516
Oh. Okay, well...

74
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:31,353
That was a real roller coaster.

75
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,416
By the way, travel tip...

76
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,815
You should probably download
a VPN on your phone just

77
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,230
so that the government can't
track you while we're abroad.

78
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,831
Smart. Will do.

79
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:48,008
Dude, I think that
went really great.

80
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:52,297
When, when I blipped back
to my apartment, the

81
00:05:52,322 --> 00:05:55,235
family that was living
there was very confused.

82
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:57,930
The wife thought that
I was a mistress,

83
00:05:57,961 --> 00:06:00,250
Grandma thought that I was a ghost...
It was...

84
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:01,975
It was really a mess.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,436
Thank you all for coming out to support
those who have been displaced by the blip.

86
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:10,679
And of course, thanks to
our very own, Spider-Man!

87
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,886
Thank you, Ms. Parker
for having me.

88
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:27,222
And, thank you, you
guys for having me.

89
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:30,633
Well, thank you, Spider-Man.

90
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:34,712
He'll be right back out to take
photos and videos. Thank you.

91
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:42,176
- That was amazing.
- That was great!

92
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,668
That was so cool.
I was so nervous.

93
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:45,862
Sorry, I was a little stiff. I felt
like I wasn't in the pocket...

94
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:46,808
No, I thought you did great.

95
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,270
Yeah, well, I actually did
think you were a little stiff.

96
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:52,325
- I felt that, too. I felt that, too.
- It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

97
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:53,044
Okay...

98
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,340
- Did you get your passport?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:56,387
- Minty toothpaste?
- Yeah.

100
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:59,560
Hey, sorry I'm late.

101
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:01,016
Happy! Hey.

102
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:03,486
- Oh, you look lovely.
- Thanks, you too.

103
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:05,284
Thank you. New dress?

104
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,063
Uh, yeah, yes. It is.

105
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,857
- That's a new beard.
- It's my... my blip beard.

106
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:13,443
'Cause I grew it... in the blip...
blip beard.

107
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,740
I see.

108
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:17,371
Anyway, so, the reason I'm
late is because this was

109
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,848
misplaced at the office, can you
believe it? Because it's enormous?

110
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,903
I mean, not the amount. The size.
The amount is nice, too.

111
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:25,052
The very generous
Pepper Potts, said,

112
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,771
- Thank you.
- she's sorry she couldn't be here.

113
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,966
I think I'm gonna go change the
sterno under the vegan lasagna.

114
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,217
Spider-Man, go shake hands.

115
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:35,552
Will do.

116
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,046
What just happened?

117
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,265
Heads up...

118
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,917
- Nick Fury's calling you.
- Nick Fury's gonna call me?

119
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:46,942
- Yeah.
- Why?

120
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:50,747
Why? Because he probably, have some... hero
stuff for you to do. You're a superhero.

121
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:51,849
He calls superheroes.

122
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:55,559
Well, I mean if it was really that important,
he'd probably call someone else. Not me.

123
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:57,411
Apparently not.

124
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,240
No caller ID. That's him.

125
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,475
I don't really wanna
talk to Nick Fury.

126
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,422
- Answer the phone.
- Why?

127
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:07,782
Because if you don't talk to him, then I
have to talk. I don't wanna talk to him.

128
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:10,697
- Why don't you wanna talk to him?
- Because I'm scared. Just answer the phone.

129
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,025
You sent Nick Fury to voicemail?

130
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:13,618
Yeah.

131
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,291
- You don't send Nick Fury to voicemail.
- Did you hear that? They're calling me.

132
00:08:16,322 --> 00:08:17,454
I gotta go.
I gotta go.

133
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,563
- You gotta talk to him.
- I'm gonna call him.

134
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:20,893
I promise you, I'm gonna call him.
I will.

135
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,744
You do not ghost Nick Fury.

136
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:24,924
I promise you, I'll call him...

137
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:29,126
after my trip. Hey!

138
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:33,087
Yeah? No, no. He's
not ghosting you.

139
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:37,905
Okay, okay, one
question at a time.

140
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,610
Are you the head Avenger now?

141
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:41,798
No, I'm not.

142
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:45,999
If the aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

143
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,328
Does anyone have any
neighborhood question?

144
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:50,414
Shawn Winford, Queens Tribune.

145
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:54,414
What is it like to take over from Tony
Stark? Those are some big shoes to fill.

146
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,343
I'm, uh...

147
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:02,132
I'm gonna go. Thanks so
much everyone, for coming.

148
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:42,908
Okay...

149
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:50,022
Hungry?

150
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,522
So sorry.

151
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:56,123
I thought that you could
sense that, with your

152
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:57,168
Peter-tingle.

153
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:59,412
Please, do not start calling
it my Peter-tingle.

154
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:02,811
So what's up? You can dodge
bullets but not bananas?

155
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,153
No, I just really need this vacation.
I need a break.

156
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:08,935
You deserve it.

157
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:13,965
You know what?

158
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:16,677
You should pack your
suit, just in case.

159
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:18,352
I have a tingle about it.

160
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,250
Please stop saying tingle, May?

161
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,500
No, no. I'm not.

162
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:39,212
Yeah!

163
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:49,494
Do you want the first shift? Just
saying that I could take either.

164
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,644
Give me the third shift.

165
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:53,347
I can't chaperone
these kids alone.

166
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:56,376
Yo, Parker, this is
called an airplane.

167
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:59,910
It's like the buses you're used to, except
it flies over the poor neighborhoods

168
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:02,395
- instead of driving through them.
- Ma'am?

169
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:06,349
He blipped, so technically
he's 16, not 21.

170
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:07,870
I'll take that.

171
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:10,229
She's lying. I don't
even know this girl.

172
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,619
Classic MJ, right?

173
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:18,650
Did you know Brad was coming?

174
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:20,806
It's... so weird.

175
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:24,213
Like, one day, he's that little kid who
cried and got nosebleeds all the time,

176
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:28,119
and suddenly, we blip back and he's
totally ripped and super nice,

177
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:30,910
- and all these girls are after him?
- Not all the girls are after him.

178
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:33,224
No man. They're all after him.

179
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:37,050
Anyway, on to more
important things...

180
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:40,731
It's a 9-hour flight. We can play
Beast Slayers the whole time.

181
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,910
I need your help
to sit next to MJ.

182
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:48,609
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously!

183
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:51,501
What about your plan?
American bachelors in Europe?

184
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:54,924
That's your plan. That's a solo plan.
Come on, this is my plan.

185
00:11:57,768 --> 00:11:58,861
Please.

186
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,651
Hey, guys, uh...

187
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:09,211
There's an old lady sitting in front of us,
wearing a crazy amount of perfume, and...

188
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:12,845
it's kind of setting
off Peter's allergies.

189
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:16,212
You know, Betty, if you could just
switch seats with him, that would be...

190
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,353
He's allergic to perfume?

191
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,401
Yeah, yeah, 'cause, umm...
it makes his eyes water...

192
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,910
- and he can only see...
- Excuse me, Peter has a perfume allergy?

193
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:26,658
- Oh, uhh...
- Well I'll tell you from experience,

194
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:30,229
perfume allergies are no joke. I can
feel hives breaking out already.

195
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:33,361
MJ, stand up. Ned,
take MJ's spot.

196
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,042
MJ, you take my spot.

197
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:37,222
Peter, come with me. Let's
get you out of there.

198
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,411
Zach and Sebastian, you
take Ned and Peter's seats.

199
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,698
Ned, thanks for bringing
this to my attention.

200
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:47,707
Your safety is my responsibilty.
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...

201
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:51,562
I got it for now. Let's go, Peter.
Let's go!

202
00:12:58,252 --> 00:12:59,252
Yep...

203
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,361
I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.

204
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,398
So...

205
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:08,460
- Do you wanna play Beast Slayer?
- Nope.

206
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:11,701
Have you, have you ever played
any kind of PC game...

207
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:12,843
Nope.

208
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,347
Did I tell you how my wife
pretended to blip out?

209
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:20,800
Turns out, she ran off with
a guy in her hiking group.

210
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:22,443
We had a fake funeral
for her and everything.

211
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,278
Well, the funeral was real.

212
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,873
Because I thought she was really dead.
Do you wanna see the video?

213
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:30,060
Oh, I got a dual headphone adapter
if you wanna watch a movie.

214
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:32,487
Only if it's depressing.
Or hilarious.

215
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:35,868
Oh, you have a dual headphone adapter.
We can watch together.

216
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:38,743
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain speaking.

217
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:43,078
Our flight time today will be eight hours
and forty-nine minutes to Venice, Italy.

218
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,707
Hey, man.

219
00:14:51,005 --> 00:14:52,983
Did you see Brad and MJ on the plane?
They were

220
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:55,112
watching movies and
laughing the entire time.

221
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:57,646
Dude, don't worry, okay?
I'm sure that's nothing.

222
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:00,027
Hey, Babe. Can you hold
this for me, please?

223
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:02,467
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

224
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,789
What was that?

225
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:15,924
Well, we actually got to talking
on the plane, and it turns out...

226
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:20,113
We have a lot in common. So, uh,
we're boyfriend-girlfriend now.

227
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:22,953
Whatever happened to being an
American bachelor in Europe?

228
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:23,795
Peter...

229
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:28,364
Those were the words of a boy.
That boy, met a woman.

230
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:32,168
A very strong and powerful woman.
And now...

231
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:34,763
- That boy's a man.
- Babe?

232
00:15:34,788 --> 00:15:36,443
Coming, Babe.

233
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:44,271
There's nothing in there.
I swear.

234
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:01,752
This, no.

235
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:11,652
Sorry.

236
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:14,988
- I'm here.
- Wait, wait, wait...

237
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,395
- Peter's here.
- Thank goodness.

238
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,540
Looks like we're here.

239
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,782
Doing some renovations to the place.
Getting some upgrades.

240
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,485
- That must be the concierge.
- Okay.

241
00:17:00,612 --> 00:17:02,687
Everyone, here we are.

242
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,945
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

243
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,852
- Tell me we're not staying here.
- Wow!

244
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:10,242
- This place is sinking.
- I think you mean 'charming'.

245
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:11,961
Okay, everybody.

246
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,150
Drop your bags off, we're gonna meet at
the Da Vinci museum at three. Let's go!

247
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:17,956
- Vamonos!
- It's andiamo.

248
00:17:17,981 --> 00:17:19,038
Andiamo!

249
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:23,780
When in Rome, we do as the Romans do.
We here in Venice, the socks get wet.

250
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:32,843
What's up, Flash mob? How are you guys
doing? I'm here in Saint Marco Polo...

251
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:36,648
This is so much fun!

252
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:00,980
Three, two, one.

253
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:04,106
- Say "pizza"!
- Pizza!

254
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:25,307
- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.

255
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:26,846
Hi. Uh...

256
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:28,994
I'm looking for a, uh...

257
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,940
Fiore nero.

258
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,164
It's perfect.

259
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:50,122
Boh!

260
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:52,601
- What?
- Boh.

261
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:55,732
It's the most perfect word in the world.
Italians created it, and I just discovered it.

262
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:56,694
What does it mean?

263
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,138
That's the thing, it can
mean a million things.

264
00:18:58,163 --> 00:18:59,250
It can mean "I don't
know", "get out of my

265
00:18:59,275 --> 00:19:01,655
face", "I don't know and
get out of my face."

266
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:04,676
It's the best thing Italy ever created.
Except for maybe espresso.

267
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,973
- Oh, so you've been drinking espresso.
- Mmm.

268
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:10,379
German? American?

269
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:11,926
Boh.

270
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,699
Whoa.

271
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:16,315
Boh is my new superpower.

272
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,605
It's like the anti aloha. I
was born to say this word.

273
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:21,769
So what's in the bag?

274
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:23,246
Oh. Uh...

275
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,830
Boh.

276
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:26,536
Nice.

277
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,639
Whoa. Cool.

278
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:53,912
What was that?

279
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:18,180
Betty! Are you okay?

280
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:21,063
Come on!

281
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,609
- What is that?
- I don't know!

282
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:29,544
- What are you gonna do?
- I left my suit in the hotel room.

283
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,310
- Why?
- Because I'm on vacation, Ned.

284
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:33,295
Everyone's gonna see my face.
Just get them out of here.

285
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Go!

286
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:46,413
Get outta here. Go!

287
00:20:48,492 --> 00:20:50,054
Oh, my God!

288
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:13,276
Oh, no, you don't.

289
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:25,818
Are you okay? Get out of here.
Go!

290
00:22:17,307 --> 00:22:19,744
Excuse me, sir! I can
help, let me help.

291
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:21,708
I'm really strong
and I'm sticky.

292
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:24,334
I need you to lead it
away from the canal.

293
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,848
The Da Vinci museum. This is
why we're here in Venice.

294
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,348
This is it.

295
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,415
It's closed. Huh.

296
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,604
What do you mean it's closed?
'Till when?

297
00:22:57,629 --> 00:22:58,604
November.

298
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,799
- You didn't check the website?
- Oh, that's a good idea.

299
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:18,478
Oh, come on.

300
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:24,172
Stay low, kids.
We'll be safe here.

301
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:24,099
Who is that guy?

302
00:24:24,123 --> 00:24:26,724
I don't know. But he's
kicking that water's ass.

303
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,126
It's aliens. It has to be.

304
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,853
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor
named Morris Bench who was exposed

305
00:25:19,878 --> 00:25:23,383
to an experimental underwater
generator and got hydro powers.

306
00:25:23,408 --> 00:25:26,252
Yeah, you should definitely believe
everything you read on the internet.

307
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,766
- Spider-Man can take him.
- What do you think it is?

308
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,476
You know, being a
man of science...

309
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,101
Witches.

310
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:37,148
No, no, no, no. We wanna stay.
We wanna stay.

311
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:40,758
It's a good thing that I packed your suit,
huh. I can't believe you forgot it.

312
00:25:40,783 --> 00:25:41,673
Yeah.

313
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:44,954
So, who was that guy that you were with?
Was that Mister Strange?

314
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,775
Doctor Strange, May.
Doctor Strange.

315
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,510
And, umm.. No. I don't know who that was.
He was a new guy.

316
00:25:50,535 --> 00:25:53,245
- I was trying to help him, but...
- Hey, Happy. No. That's my lunch.

317
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,472
- Don't eat that one.
- Happy's there?

318
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,089
Yeah. It's Happy.

319
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:59,831
He's here. He came
by to volunteer.

320
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:02,801
And, he's hanging around the office.
And he wants to say hi.

321
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:04,754
No, I don't... Hi, Peter.

322
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:06,746
Hey, Happy.

323
00:26:07,028 --> 00:26:11,356
I'm sorry. I'm working real hard here.
I gotta do a leaflet drop.

324
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:13,840
- What are you even doing...
- I'm glad you're having a good time.

325
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:16,496
Don't worry. I'm really
taking care of your aunt.

326
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:21,332
So, uhh, how's the plan going?

327
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:25,269
There's... some
setbacks, for sure.

328
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:27,847
Don't overthink it. Just trust
your instincts and you'll be fine.

329
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:30,144
I know. Love you. Bye.

330
00:26:32,238 --> 00:26:33,441
Who is that guy?

331
00:26:33,503 --> 00:26:35,987
He's like Iron Man and
Thor rolled into one.

332
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:40,775
- He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.
- What is it with you and Spider-Man?

333
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:45,832
What? He's just awesome, okay? He
protects the neighborhood, and, you know,

334
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:48,903
he's inspiring. He inspires
me to be a better man.

335
00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:51,928
'Sup, dickwad? I
thought you drowned.

336
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:56,626
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

337
00:26:56,735 --> 00:27:00,055
Luomo del misterio is
Italian for man of mystery.

338
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,837
They don't actually
know who he is.

339
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:03,462
Mysterio.

340
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:06,302
- Cool name.
- Cool name.

341
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:08,693
- Babe!
- Babe!

342
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:12,677
- So, how much did you actually see?
- Not much... I was running.

343
00:27:12,702 --> 00:27:15,334
Right. Me too. I
was also running.

344
00:27:15,623 --> 00:27:16,827
Away.

345
00:27:18,608 --> 00:27:20,248
So, Paris tomorrow.

346
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:23,778
Go to the Eiffel tower.
Should be great.

347
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:28,377
I read it was secretly built as a mind control
antenna to create an army of the insane.

348
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:32,524
Which is why it's my favorite
destination on the whole trip.

349
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,555
What are you gonna do
about the water monster?

350
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,071
Nothing. It's dead.

351
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:41,917
And besides, that Mysterio
guy's all over it. Look...

352
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:45,184
I just wanna spend some time
with MJ, while talking about Paris and...

353
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:47,912
- I think she really likes me.
- That's nice.

354
00:27:47,937 --> 00:27:50,069
It reminds me of when Betty
and I first fell in love.

355
00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:52,052
I had just finished my
fruit cobbler, right...

356
00:27:56,229 --> 00:28:00,783
You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.

357
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:05,771
You're Nick Fury.

358
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:07,803
You just shot Ned.

359
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:10,209
It's just a mild tranquilizer.
He'll be all right.

360
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,599
So good to finally meet you.

361
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:17,746
I saw you at the funeral, but I didn't think
that was a good time to exchange numbers.

362
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:19,685
No, that would have been
really inappropriate.

363
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,905
That's what I just said.

364
00:28:22,153 --> 00:28:24,511
The important thing is, you're here.

365
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,802
I tried to bring you here. You
avoided me, and now, you're here.

366
00:28:28,827 --> 00:28:30,653
What a coincidence.

367
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:33,143
Wait. Was this a coincidence?

368
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:36,079
I used to know everything.

369
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:40,077
Then I come back five years
later and now, I know nothing.

370
00:28:40,102 --> 00:28:42,610
No intel, no team,

371
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:48,211
and a high school kid,
is dodging my calls.

372
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:49,825
Here's what I do know...

373
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:57,614
A week ago, a village in Mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone.

374
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:01,247
Witnesses say that
cyclone had a face.

375
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:06,665
Three days later...

376
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:10,220
A similar event in Morocco.
A village was...

377
00:29:12,345 --> 00:29:17,076
Just making the rounds. See if anyone needs any
emotional counseling after today's traumatic event.

378
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:19,704
No. We're... we're okay.
We're fine, thank you.

379
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:23,416
Great. 'Cause I'm not
qualified, to actually...

380
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:26,778
Oh, he's passed out. I'm not really
qualified to do it anyway, so...

381
00:29:26,803 --> 00:29:28,245
Good night.

382
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:32,810
That was my teacher. Sorry about that.
You were saying?

383
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:36,073
A village was destroyed by what may
well be another world threatening...

384
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:39,379
Babe, you still awake? You're
not answering any of my texts.

385
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,258
Um... he's asleep, Betty.

386
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:43,856
- Oh. Already?
- Hm-mmm. Yeah.

387
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:46,969
- Okay.
- That's why it's imperative...

388
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:50,670
Boys! That canal water today was
filled with dangerous bacteria...

389
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:55,171
Another person touches that door, you and
I are going to attend another funeral.

390
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:03,575
Stark left these for you.

391
00:30:03,826 --> 00:30:04,911
Really?

392
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:19,582
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

393
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:24,676
Stark said you wouldn't get that because
it's not a Star Wars reference.

394
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,990
Remove the mask. Everyone
here has seen you without it.

395
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,521
You'd only be feigning anonymity and breathing
through spandex for no good reason.

396
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:42,654
Come on.

397
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,350
Yeah.

398
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,615
There, we have Maria Hill.

399
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:54,248
That, is Dimitri.

400
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:58,756
And this, is Mr. Beck.

401
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:01,998
Mysterio?

402
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:03,022
What?

403
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,014
Doesn't matter. It's just what my
friends have been calling you.

404
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:10,295
Well, you can call me Quentin.

405
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:16,397
You handled yourself well out there today.
Saw what you did with the tower.

406
00:31:16,435 --> 00:31:18,549
We could've used someone
like you on my world.

407
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:19,697
Thanks.

408
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,430
I'm sorry... Your world?

409
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:25,883
Oh, Mr. Beck is from Earth.
Just not yours.

410
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:27,892
There are multiple realities, Peter.

411
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:31,439
This is Earth dimension 616.
I'm from Earth-833.

412
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,278
I'm sorry. You're saying
there's a multiverse?

413
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:37,313
I thought that was just theoretical. I mean,
that completely changes how we understand

414
00:31:37,338 --> 00:31:40,916
the initial singularity. We're talking
about, an eternal inflation system.

415
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:44,728
And how does that even work with
all the quantum... it's insane!

416
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,611
Sorry.

417
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,439
It's really cool.

418
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:52,853
Don't ever apologize for being
the smartest one in the room.

419
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:55,580
Anyway...

420
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:00,353
They were born in stable orbits.
Within black

421
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:03,117
holes, creatures formed
from the primary elements.

422
00:32:03,142 --> 00:32:05,758
Air, water, fire, earth.

423
00:32:05,783 --> 00:32:10,843
The science division had a technical name.
We just called them Elementals.

424
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:13,250
Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.

425
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:16,470
- It turns out, the myths are real.
- Like Thor.

426
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:20,134
Thor was a myth, and now I
study him in my physics class.

427
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:22,650
These myths, are threats.

428
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,649
They first materialized on my earth many
years ago. We mobilized and fought them.

429
00:32:26,674 --> 00:32:29,345
But with each battle they
grew and got stronger.

430
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,627
I was part of the last battalion
left trying to stop them.

431
00:32:32,652 --> 00:32:34,573
All we did was delay
the inevitable.

432
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:37,784
Well, the Elementals are here now.
Attacking the same coordinates.

433
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:39,426
Our satellites confirm it.

434
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:43,309
So thank Mr. Beck for destroying the
other three. There's only one left.

435
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,333
Fire.

436
00:32:44,341 --> 00:32:48,512
The strongest of them all. The
one that destroyed my earth.

437
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:52,442
It's the one that
took my family.

438
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,292
I'm sorry.

439
00:32:56,706 --> 00:32:59,292
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

440
00:32:59,393 --> 00:33:02,228
We have one mission: kill it.

441
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:04,581
You're coming with us.

442
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,587
I'm sorry. Did you say Prague?

443
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:12,915
Listen, Fury, this all seems like big-time,
you know, huge, superhero kind of stuff.

444
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,121
And...

445
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:16,511
I mean I'm just a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

446
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,465
Bitch, please. You've
been to space.

447
00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:20,214
I know, but that was an accident.
Sir, come on.

448
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:22,796
There's gotta be someone
else you can use.

449
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:25,025
- What about Thor?
- Off-world.

450
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:26,250
Okay, umm...

451
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:27,906
- Doctor Strange?
- Unavailable.

452
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:29,945
- Captain Marvel!
- Don't invoke her name.

453
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,968
Sir, I really wanna help. I do.

454
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:34,665
But if my aunt finds out I left my
class trip, she's gonna kill me.

455
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,235
And if I'm seen like this in Europe,
after the Washington Monument,

456
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,830
my whole class will figure
out who I am, and then...

457
00:33:39,862 --> 00:33:43,104
And then the whole world will figure
out who I am. And then, I'm done.

458
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:47,057
Okay. I understand.

459
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:48,917
I'm sorry, what?

460
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:53,432
Why don't you get back before your
teachers miss you and become suspicious.

461
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:58,667
Dimitri. Take him back
to the hotel, please.

462
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,729
Thank you, Mr. Fury.

463
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:03,981
And, uh... Good luck.

464
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:06,427
See you, kid.

465
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,006
Yeah, see ya.

466
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,605
- Bye, Ma'am.
- Yeah.

467
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:20,358
Okay, drink lots of water, and I'm
gonna get you a vitamin C pill.

468
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:22,308
You cannot get sick. Okay, Babe?

469
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:25,051
- Yes, Baby.
- Hey, man. Are you sure you're good?

470
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:27,171
- Dude, I'm fine!
- Okay.

471
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:29,132
Okay? Don't worry. Seriously...

472
00:34:29,163 --> 00:34:31,389
Getting tranqed in the neck
by Nick Fury? Probably

473
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:33,085
the coolest thing to ever
happen to me anyway.

474
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,509
- It is pretty awesome.
- Yeah.

475
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:35,992
I'm just happy I don't
have to go to Prague.

476
00:34:36,017 --> 00:34:36,680
Seriously.

477
00:34:36,705 --> 00:34:37,705
Good news!

478
00:34:37,713 --> 00:34:39,556
We're going to Prague.

479
00:34:40,314 --> 00:34:41,595
What?

480
00:34:41,634 --> 00:34:42,634
Yeah.

481
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,838
Tour company called.
They upgraded us.

482
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:47,768
You should've heard me on the phone
with them. I really gave them hell.

483
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:49,605
All I heard was crying.

484
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:51,494
Look at our upgraded ride!

485
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,797
- Huh?
- Wow.

486
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:56,117
- I'm impressed, Mr. Harrington.
- Oh, come on.

487
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,132
Peter, wha...

488
00:34:58,474 --> 00:34:59,789
What's going on?

489
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,705
I think Nick Fury just
hijacked our summer vacation.

490
00:35:08,377 --> 00:35:09,283
Okay.

491
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:10,611
Awesome.

492
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,728
Yeah. Awesome.

493
00:35:36,587 --> 00:35:37,625
Yo, what's up, Flash mob.

494
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,985
It's your boy, the big F. Cruising through
the Alps with my private driver Dimitri.

495
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:05,470
For the next Tony
Stark, I trust you.

496
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:07,666
Say EDITH.

497
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:12,861
Standby for retinal
and biometric scan.

498
00:36:12,885 --> 00:36:15,251
Retinal and biometric
scan accepted.

499
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:17,345
- Hello?
- Hello, Peter.

500
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,720
I am EDITH.

501
00:36:18,798 --> 00:36:22,361
Tony Stark's augmented reality
security and defense system.

502
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,360
- So he made you for me?
- No. But you have access

503
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:27,760
- to all of Tony's protocols.
- Cool.

504
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,963
Would you like to
see what I can do?

505
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,662
EDITH stands for...

506
00:36:36,687 --> 00:36:38,905
Even Dead, I'm The Hero.

507
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,007
- Tony loved his acronyms.
- Yeah, he did.

508
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:45,446
I have access to the entire
Stark global security network...

509
00:36:45,477 --> 00:36:48,477
Including multiple defense
satellites, as well as back doors

510
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:51,289
to all major
telecommunication networks.

511
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,200
Whoa...

512
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:59,676
Is MJ texting?

513
00:37:02,142 --> 00:37:04,649
No. Don't look at it.
That's wrong.

514
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,063
That's wrong.

515
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:26,161
Break for the toilet.
Ten minutes.

516
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:31,776
Ten minutes, everyone!

517
00:37:31,862 --> 00:37:35,315
Dimitri, where exactly are we?

518
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,220
I'll figure it out. Yeah.

519
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:42,969
What?

520
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:56,999
Hello.

521
00:37:57,311 --> 00:37:58,592
Close the door.

522
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:05,669
I'm Peter Parker.

523
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:07,543
Take off your clothes.

524
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:10,114
Excuse me?

525
00:38:10,145 --> 00:38:12,832
You told Fury Spider-Man
cannot be seen in Europe.

526
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,325
So I made you this.
Another suit.

527
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,363
Oh, uh... Thank you.

528
00:38:19,074 --> 00:38:20,636
Not sure it fits...

529
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:23,363
- Take off your clothes.
- Okay.

530
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:26,723
Sure. Umm...

531
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,098
- It's a little embarassing.
- Now. Hurry up.

532
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:32,731
Weird...

533
00:38:40,713 --> 00:38:43,338
Sorry. I thought this
was the bathroom.

534
00:38:43,346 --> 00:38:45,533
- This is not what it looks like. Just...
- Yeah.

535
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:46,925
What are you doing?

536
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:49,666
Don't shoot anybody. Brad?

537
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:51,869
It's not what it
looks like, buddy.

538
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:53,775
- Hey, man. Look.
- Look, Peter...

539
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,908
I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.

540
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,943
If you wanna hook up with some random European
chick on our school trip, that's on you.

541
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,319
That's not what that was.
Honestly.

542
00:39:00,344 --> 00:39:02,404
I can't pretend that I
didn't see what I just saw.

543
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:04,713
I know you're trying to get with MJ.
It's obvious.

544
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:06,913
- I like her, too.
- Wait a minute. Hey, hey...

545
00:39:06,938 --> 00:39:08,922
You cannot show that photo, dude.
Come on.

546
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,508
I'm sorry, man.
I have to.

547
00:39:10,532 --> 00:39:12,367
She deserves the truth.

548
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:18,070
Okay. Put your one foot in front of the
other, and everybody back on the bus.

549
00:39:18,414 --> 00:39:19,414
Let's go!

550
00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:28,521
- EDITH?
- Hello, Peter.

551
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,667
- How can I help you?
- Hey, umm...

552
00:39:30,692 --> 00:39:34,284
- There's this guy in my class who's...
- Peter I'm having difficulty hearing you.

553
00:39:34,404 --> 00:39:36,106
Can you please speak up?

554
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:38,743
Umm... Brad Davis. He
has a photo of me.

555
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:40,986
Brad Davis.
Is he a target?

556
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:42,821
Is Brad a target? Umm...

557
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:49,930
Yeah. He's a target.
He's a target.

558
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:50,994
Copy that.

559
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:52,789
Target is Brad Davis.

560
00:39:52,813 --> 00:39:55,266
- Initiating strike.
- Initiating what, now?

561
00:39:55,322 --> 00:39:57,985
Intercept point determined.
Releasing kill vehicle.

562
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,174
EDITH?

563
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:22,856
Oh, my God...

564
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:24,950
Dope glasses, Parker.
How'd you pay for these?

565
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:26,381
Flash, come here.
Give me that, Flash.

566
00:40:26,406 --> 00:40:28,383
- I'm really paying you a compliment...
- Please, please!

567
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:31,294
I'm so sorry.

568
00:40:33,216 --> 00:40:34,341
EDITH, don't kill Brad.

569
00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:36,694
Peter, do you want me to cancel
the drone strike on Brad Davis?

570
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:38,578
- Did you just punch Flash?
- No!

571
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:39,883
Firing.

572
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:49,809
This is not the Autobahn!

573
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:50,997
EDITH!

574
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:56,495
Commencing second strike.

575
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,902
Peter, why aren't you behaving in
that seat? Buckle up right now!

576
00:40:58,927 --> 00:41:01,363
- Look at the baby mountain goats!
- Baby mountain goats?

577
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,414
I don't see any
mountain goats...

578
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,127
You missed them.

579
00:41:20,303 --> 00:41:23,036
I know you think none of
us have noticed, Peter...

580
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:24,061
What?

581
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,006
But your new
look, I love it.

582
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:28,771
- Right, Babe?
- Thanks.

583
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:31,498
Yeah. Sophisticated,
classy, and very European.

584
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,787
Oh, man...

585
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:35,695
Let's try that again.

586
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,638
This is so weird. It was
right here on my phone. I...

587
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,608
Yeah. Weird.

588
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:17,002
Wow. This place is so classy.

589
00:42:17,027 --> 00:42:18,495
Yeah, so why are we here?

590
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,215
Speak for yourself. I'm home.

591
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,355
What can I say?

592
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,111
The squeaky wheel gets
the upgrade grease.

593
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:29,682
Everyone, get settled in, rest up.
Because tonight, big surprise,

594
00:42:29,707 --> 00:42:33,582
is Prague's annual
Carnival of Lights.

595
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,543
- Hello?
- Parker, it's Hill.

596
00:42:35,568 --> 00:42:37,318
There's an earpiece with your suit.
Put it on

597
00:42:37,343 --> 00:42:39,508
and await further instructions.
Understood?

598
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:41,267
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Yeah.

599
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,260
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

600
00:42:42,285 --> 00:42:44,088
Look, I am so sorry,

601
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,915
if I seem like I'm preoccupied
with my relationship.

602
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,247
You know I'm still
your guy in the chair.

603
00:42:48,272 --> 00:42:50,182
No, no. It's all good.
Don't worry about it.

604
00:42:50,207 --> 00:42:51,535
Okay. Great. Great.

605
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
It's fine.

606
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:55,346
So, what's the status
on the Elemental thing?

607
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:58,065
- Where's it gonna happen?
- Uh, here... in the city.

608
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,744
- Peter, we're here.
- I know. I know.

609
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:01,940
It's not good. I'm
figuring it out.

610
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:05,277
You have to do something, Peter. Please.
We're all counting on you.

611
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:07,183
- Ned...
- Yeah. Yeah, Babe.

612
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:09,747
The good news is, we've
all got our own rooms.

613
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,426
Serious?

614
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:12,574
Parker?

615
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,263
- Parker!
- Yes, sir.

616
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,676
That thing is going to
be here in a few hours.

617
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:18,090
Are we boring you?

618
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,936
He's not bored. He's just thinking
about how you kidnapped him.

619
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:24,278
He had obstacles.
I removed them.

620
00:43:24,303 --> 00:43:26,615
They still won't
evacuate the city.

621
00:43:27,235 --> 00:43:28,373
Idiots.

622
00:43:29,194 --> 00:43:31,138
So what's the plan, Parker?

623
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,428
I will be in the
cathedral tower,

624
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:37,366
keeping watch for the fire monster. When
that shows up, I will radio you guys...

625
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:40,778
- And then, uh, Mr. Beck and I...
- My name is Mysterio.

626
00:43:43,965 --> 00:43:46,478
That's when Mysterio
and I will move in.

627
00:43:46,503 --> 00:43:47,838
Peter, listen to me.

628
00:43:47,863 --> 00:43:50,245
The best hope you have,
the only hope...

629
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:53,494
is to stop it here, now.
No matter what the cost.

630
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:56,987
Maneuver it away from civilians if you can.
But most importantly,

631
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:59,260
Keep it away from metal.

632
00:43:59,315 --> 00:44:02,622
If it gets too big, it'll be able to
draw power from the earth's core.

633
00:44:02,647 --> 00:44:05,584
After that, there's
no way to stop it.

634
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:11,682
Hey, man. My friends are here.

635
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:13,877
And I can't help but think that
we're putting them in danger.

636
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:17,025
You're worried about us
hurting your friends?

637
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:21,409
You? Who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?

638
00:44:21,988 --> 00:44:27,823
Stark gave you a multi-billion dollar
A.R tactical intelligence system.

639
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:30,866
And the first thing you do with it,
is try to blow up your friends.

640
00:44:30,913 --> 00:44:36,186
It's clear to me that you
were not ready for this.

641
00:44:42,898 --> 00:44:44,866
Look, Fury asked me to come
up here and see how you

642
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,718
were doing. He just, he felt
bad about snapping at you.

643
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:48,694
Really?

644
00:44:48,742 --> 00:44:51,734
You guys do have sarcasm
on this earth, right?

645
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:54,625
How you feelin'?

646
00:44:58,777 --> 00:45:02,058
I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.

647
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:05,206
I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...

648
00:45:06,343 --> 00:45:09,336
I had this plan with this girl
that I really like, and...

649
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:12,734
Now it's all ruined.

650
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:22,719
You're not a jerk for
wanting a normal life, kid.

651
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:25,854
It's a hard path.

652
00:45:26,464 --> 00:45:29,815
You see things, you do things...
Make choices.

653
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:32,581
People look up to you...

654
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,805
Even if you win a battle
sometimes, they die.

655
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:39,890
I like you, Peter.
You're a good kid.

656
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:44,391
There's a part of me that
wants me to tell you, just...

657
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:46,876
turn around, run
away from all this.

658
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:50,439
And then, there's another part of me
that knows what we're about to fight.

659
00:45:50,842 --> 00:45:53,787
What's at stake. And
I'm glad you're here.

660
00:45:55,454 --> 00:45:57,204
- Me, too.
- But...

661
00:45:57,229 --> 00:46:00,141
- You're worried about your friends.
- Yeah.

662
00:46:00,744 --> 00:46:03,578
I just always feel like I'm
putting them in danger.

663
00:46:03,603 --> 00:46:05,103
Look, just...

664
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:07,924
Get them inside and keep
them in a safe place,

665
00:46:07,949 --> 00:46:10,424
for just a few hours.
It'll be all right.

666
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:12,965
It's really nice...

667
00:46:13,192 --> 00:46:16,559
To have somebody to talk to
about, superhero stuff, you know?

668
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:19,254
Anytime.

669
00:46:19,637 --> 00:46:20,777
And hey...

670
00:46:21,035 --> 00:46:23,972
We survive this, you'll have
all summer to kill Brad.

671
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:30,201
- See you out there.
- All right.

672
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:37,695
Sorry. That's Italian.

673
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:42,886
EDITH?

674
00:46:43,854 --> 00:46:45,708
- Hello, Peter.
- Hey, uhh...

675
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:48,502
I need to find a way to keep my friends
inside for the next few hours?

676
00:46:48,527 --> 00:46:50,138
Let's see what we can do.

677
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,753
Good news...

678
00:46:52,105 --> 00:46:53,870
We're going to the opera!

679
00:46:54,004 --> 00:46:55,417
- Huh?
- The opera?

680
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:56,831
Don't look at me.

681
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,815
- What happened to the carnival?
- Well this is upgrade living, guys.

682
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,324
Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.

683
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:04,629
For free!

684
00:47:04,848 --> 00:47:06,512
Do you have any idea how
much opera tickets cost?

685
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:10,111
No. Because none of us have
ever wanted to go to the opera.

686
00:47:10,136 --> 00:47:11,083
Ever.

687
00:47:11,443 --> 00:47:14,143
Well, I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.

688
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:15,308
Thank you, Ned.

689
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,675
Everyone,

690
00:47:17,081 --> 00:47:21,543
this is gonna be, maybe, the best
four hours of our whole trip.

691
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:23,182
Four hours?!

692
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,870
Guys, I think this is gonna
be really fun. Seriously.

693
00:47:27,963 --> 00:47:31,237
I bet now you're all happy that
I had you pack a nice outfit.

694
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:33,823
Yeah, because we'd much
rather go to a 4-hour opera

695
00:47:33,848 --> 00:47:35,926
instead of the biggest
party in the world.

696
00:47:35,951 --> 00:47:38,198
Again, don't look at me.

697
00:47:38,661 --> 00:47:41,654
Parker, you copy? Comm check.
One, two.

698
00:47:44,184 --> 00:47:46,128
- Okay...
- Here we are.

699
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,442
- Beat the rush.
- Yeah. The rush out.

700
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,590
Lucky for us, we got the
best seats in the house.

701
00:47:53,552 --> 00:47:54,684
Let's go.

702
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:59,074
Hey. I'll save you a seat.

703
00:48:05,605 --> 00:48:07,339
You look really pretty.

704
00:48:07,402 --> 00:48:09,331
And therefore, I have value?

705
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:11,868
No. No, that was not what I meant at all.
I was just...

706
00:48:11,893 --> 00:48:13,690
I'm messing with you.

707
00:48:14,637 --> 00:48:16,494
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

708
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:19,355
- You look pretty, too.
- Thank you.

709
00:48:19,434 --> 00:48:21,801
- Oh, my gosh, opera glasses!
- So cute!

710
00:48:21,826 --> 00:48:22,826
Can I...

711
00:48:23,778 --> 00:48:25,840
Want to go in, on a pair?

712
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:28,973
- You mean, us sit next to each other?
- Yeah.

713
00:48:28,997 --> 00:48:31,528
- Are you in position?
- No.

714
00:48:31,669 --> 00:48:33,661
- Okay. No...
- Why the hell not?

715
00:48:33,686 --> 00:48:36,568
You don't wanna sit next to
me, or you just don't want...

716
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,232
I didn't mean that. I, uh...

717
00:48:39,257 --> 00:48:42,100
If you go ahead, I'll go...
grab us a pair.

718
00:48:42,983 --> 00:48:44,909
I'll save you a seat,
next to me, because,

719
00:48:44,934 --> 00:48:45,545
Awesome.

720
00:48:45,586 --> 00:48:47,834
There's a lot of seats,
so I'll be over there.

721
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:49,091
Okay.

722
00:48:49,116 --> 00:48:51,881
- Parker.
- No, I'm coming. I'm...

723
00:48:52,459 --> 00:48:53,623
Hey, I gotta go.

724
00:48:54,002 --> 00:48:56,645
Umm, could you just tell MJ
that I'm sick or something?

725
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,424
Okay. Be careful.

726
00:48:58,449 --> 00:49:02,541
And Peter, whatever you do, please steer
the monster away from the opera house.

727
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,111
Yeah, Ned. I know.

728
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:05,530
- Okay.
- Okay?

729
00:49:06,182 --> 00:49:07,455
Gotta go.

730
00:49:22,105 --> 00:49:24,566
Parker! You better
be on your way.

731
00:49:25,113 --> 00:49:26,277
Coming.

732
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:35,134
Where do you think she's going? Do you
think she's going to the carnival?

733
00:49:35,197 --> 00:49:38,353
We should go, too. Yes, we should go.
Come on, let's go.

734
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:39,970
Come on!

735
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,978
All right. I'm in position.

736
00:49:58,292 --> 00:50:01,814
As soon as I see something
bad, I'll let you know.

737
00:50:01,862 --> 00:50:03,876
- Roger that.
- How's the suit?

738
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:06,276
The suit's great. It's awesome.

739
00:50:06,643 --> 00:50:08,502
It's a little tight around
the old web-shooter...

740
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:10,682
- Parker!
- Okay. I'll shut up.

741
00:50:10,746 --> 00:50:13,097
Oh, my God, Babe!
Isn't this beautiful?

742
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:15,542
Yeah. It's real... Real
beautiful, Babe...

743
00:50:15,605 --> 00:50:17,737
- What's wrong?
- Uh, you know,

744
00:50:17,796 --> 00:50:20,921
honestly, I just... I don't do
well with big crowds, so...

745
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:24,514
- Maybe we should...
- I have the perfect thing. Come on.

746
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:35,784
Don't worry, Babe. We'll get
away from the crowds, get

747
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:38,979
some fresh air. You'll feel
a thousand times better.

748
00:50:44,003 --> 00:50:46,573
- Energy spiking.
- We have seismic activity.

749
00:50:57,941 --> 00:51:00,784
Okay, he's here. Beck, are you ready?
You know what to do.

750
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:02,823
On your lead, Spider-Man.

751
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,619
No, come back! Come
back and help us!

752
00:51:17,856 --> 00:51:19,567
You're up, kid.

753
00:51:31,865 --> 00:51:33,717
Wait, wait, wait. Is that...

754
00:51:33,742 --> 00:51:35,420
Do you think that's Spider-Man?

755
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:38,238
No, no, no. It's like a European
rip-off version of him. I

756
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:40,592
was actually reading about him
the other day, it's not him.

757
00:51:53,707 --> 00:51:56,739
No, Beck! He's got the
carousel, he's getting bigger!

758
00:51:57,708 --> 00:51:59,903
What's, what's his name?
What's his name?

759
00:51:59,919 --> 00:52:01,864
- Night, Night-Monkey!
- Night-Monkey?

760
00:52:01,903 --> 00:52:04,113
- Yeah. Yeah...
- Night-Monkey!

761
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:06,963
- Night Monkey, help! Save us!
- Night-Monkey...

762
00:52:06,988 --> 00:52:09,300
- What? Oh, no.
- Night-Monkey, we're stuck!

763
00:52:09,347 --> 00:52:10,847
Help us! Help!

764
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:26,802
Are you okay?

765
00:52:30,365 --> 00:52:31,349
Go to Plan B?

766
00:52:31,374 --> 00:52:34,021
Yeah, we gotta hit him with
something he can't absorb.

767
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,716
I go left, you go right.

768
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:36,770
Now!

769
00:52:52,657 --> 00:52:54,251
Okay, go now!

770
00:52:57,837 --> 00:53:00,227
That hurt him. Keep it coming.

771
00:53:07,861 --> 00:53:11,095
- Spider-Man, keep your distance.
- I'm trying!

772
00:53:11,611 --> 00:53:13,642
We can't let him get
near the ferris wheel!

773
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:15,267
Okay. I'm on it!

774
00:53:38,111 --> 00:53:40,212
Whoa, what's that?

775
00:54:09,605 --> 00:54:12,751
That's it! Nice, nice.
You got him!

776
00:54:19,053 --> 00:54:20,967
No, no, no.

777
00:54:27,104 --> 00:54:28,518
It's too late.

778
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:31,042
Whatever happens...

779
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:33,143
I'm glad we met.

780
00:54:33,643 --> 00:54:35,721
Beck, what are you doing?

781
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,767
What I should've done last time.

782
00:54:43,779 --> 00:54:45,794
Beck! Don't do it!

783
00:54:49,584 --> 00:54:50,584
Beck!

784
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:12,194
Mr. Beck?

785
00:55:15,265 --> 00:55:16,819
Oh, thank God.

786
00:55:25,459 --> 00:55:29,153
I would totally kiss you, but I think
I just threw up in my mouth a little.

787
00:55:32,566 --> 00:55:34,472
I might have a mint...

788
00:55:36,162 --> 00:55:38,732
- So, it's over?
- That was the last of them.

789
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:41,885
But not the last threat
we'll ever face.

790
00:55:42,276 --> 00:55:45,534
We need to stay vigilant.

791
00:55:45,987 --> 00:55:48,745
There's a void in this world
for someone like you.

792
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:52,206
Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

793
00:55:52,299 --> 00:55:54,395
You should join us.

794
00:55:55,627 --> 00:55:58,681
Thank you. I just might
take you up on that.

795
00:56:08,919 --> 00:56:10,716
You got gifts, Parker.

796
00:56:10,888 --> 00:56:12,794
- But you didn't wanna be here.
- Mr. Fury, I...

797
00:56:12,825 --> 00:56:15,598
I'd love to have you in Berlin, too.

798
00:56:16,552 --> 00:56:20,885
But you've got to decide whether
you're going to step up, or not.

799
00:56:21,265 --> 00:56:24,819
Stark chose you. He
made you an Avenger.

800
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:26,843
I need that.

801
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,218
The world needs that.

802
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:32,800
Maybe Stark was wrong.

803
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:36,940
Was he?

804
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:40,567
The choice is yours.

805
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:56,504
Let's get a drink.

806
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,606
I'm not 21.

807
00:57:08,362 --> 00:57:09,362
Hey.

808
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:14,760
We gotta celebrate. You did
something good tonight.

809
00:57:17,107 --> 00:57:18,443
Fury was right.

810
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,994
Tony did a lot for me, so...

811
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,088
I owe it to him, to everybody...

812
00:57:24,638 --> 00:57:27,963
- Do you?
- Yeah. I mean...

813
00:57:29,734 --> 00:57:34,070
Mr. Stark, gave me a chance to be more.
He wanted me to be better than him.

814
00:57:34,238 --> 00:57:35,878
And Fury just wants me
to live up to that.

815
00:57:35,903 --> 00:57:37,597
What do you want, Peter?

816
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:40,175
- What do you mean?
- What do you want?

817
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,151
I don't know.

818
00:57:43,176 --> 00:57:45,392
What do you want? You, Peter Parker, now.
I know you're thinking about it...

819
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:47,535
I wanna go on my trip. Right?

820
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:50,045
I wanna go back on my
trip, with my friends.

821
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,624
And, go to the top
of the Eiffel tower,

822
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:56,671
with the girl who I really like,
and tell her how I feel, and...

823
00:57:58,181 --> 00:57:59,990
Give her a kiss.

824
00:58:00,362 --> 00:58:01,688
Shut up, man.

825
00:58:02,336 --> 00:58:04,468
- You're not gonna do that, are ya?
- No, I can't.

826
00:58:04,493 --> 00:58:08,132
- Why not?
- Because I have too much responsiblity.

827
00:58:09,782 --> 00:58:11,327
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

828
00:58:11,352 --> 00:58:12,711
What are those?
Are those the...

829
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:15,289
- EDITH glasses, yeah.
- It was on the floor?

830
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:17,523
Try them on. Let's see
how they look like.

831
00:58:17,545 --> 00:58:18,896
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

832
00:58:22,186 --> 00:58:24,053
I actually really like them.

833
00:58:24,236 --> 00:58:26,940
- Can I be completely honest with you?
- Please.

834
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:30,143
- You look really stupid.
- Oh.

835
00:58:30,361 --> 00:58:32,696
But maybe have a contact
lens version of them.

836
00:58:32,735 --> 00:58:34,867
- You try them on.
- No. Come on.

837
00:58:34,954 --> 00:58:36,329
- Try them on.
- I don't want...

838
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:38,642
- I don't wanna try them on.
- Try them on.

839
00:58:45,882 --> 00:58:47,415
What do you think, kid?

840
00:58:52,242 --> 00:58:54,585
"The next Tony
Stark, I trust you."

841
00:58:55,602 --> 00:58:57,905
"For the next Tony
Stark, I trust you."

842
00:58:57,953 --> 00:58:58,953
What?

843
00:58:59,508 --> 00:59:01,218
Mr. Stark left me a message
with those glasses.

844
00:59:01,243 --> 00:59:03,413
"For the next Tony
Stark, I trust you."

845
00:59:03,445 --> 00:59:06,101
I'm still not following. How
many lemonades have you had?

846
00:59:06,154 --> 00:59:08,013
He knew every mistake
I ever made, okay?

847
00:59:08,038 --> 00:59:10,775
So he must have known that I was
not ready for something like this.

848
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,033
Why would he give it to you?

849
00:59:12,058 --> 00:59:15,440
Because maybe he didn't trust me to have
EDITH, he just trusted me to pick who should.

850
00:59:15,902 --> 00:59:18,198
It makes so much more sense. He
always knew I would do what's right,

851
00:59:18,223 --> 00:59:21,939
and he's not gonna give them to Fury,
because Fury would just give himself EDITH.

852
00:59:21,964 --> 00:59:23,316
You're probably
right about that.

853
00:59:23,347 --> 00:59:26,280
Right. So, the world
needs the next Iron Man,

854
00:59:26,658 --> 00:59:28,845
and it's not gonna be me.
I mean I'm a 16-year

855
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,173
old kid from Queens. It
needs to be an adult,

856
00:59:31,205 --> 00:59:34,923
with some experience, and that's
good like Tony Stark, like you.

857
00:59:35,744 --> 00:59:37,478
No, Peter. Come on.

858
00:59:38,238 --> 00:59:39,238
No.

859
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:42,573
- EDITH?
- Hello, Peter.

860
00:59:42,597 --> 00:59:44,495
Hi. Yeah, umm...

861
00:59:45,173 --> 00:59:48,344
I'd like to transfer your
control over to Quentin Beck.

862
00:59:48,369 --> 00:59:50,812
- Peter, what are you doing?
- Doing the right thing.

863
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,578
Any transfer will
require confirmation.

864
00:59:53,603 --> 00:59:54,883
Stark gave you the glasses.

865
00:59:54,908 --> 00:59:57,634
Stark gave me a choice. It's
my choice to make, okay?

866
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:00,212
And I'm gonna make it. Look,
you're a soldier, a leader, you

867
01:00:00,237 --> 01:00:03,931
stopped the Elementals. You saved
my life, you saved the world. Okay?

868
01:00:04,259 --> 01:00:07,337
- He'd want you to have them.
- Waiting for confirmation.

869
01:00:07,362 --> 01:00:08,446
Confirm.

870
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:14,146
Welcome to the Avengers.

871
01:00:22,378 --> 01:00:24,026
They look good on you.

872
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:27,776
Thank you. It's an honor.

873
01:00:28,308 --> 01:00:29,308
Yeah.

874
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,839
Mr. Stark would've
really liked you.

875
01:00:34,183 --> 01:00:36,922
- Where are you headed?
- I'm gonna go find MJ.

876
01:00:36,947 --> 01:00:40,876
Good luck, kid. I give you about a 50/50
chance. You're pretty awkward, so...

877
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:42,738
Yeah.

878
01:00:43,555 --> 01:00:45,782
- See you later, man.
- See ya.

879
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:20,743
See? That wasn't so hard.

880
01:01:22,003 --> 01:01:25,110
Somebody get this
stupid costume off me!

881
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:35,193
Okay, we got EDITH. Get these
connected to our system.

882
01:01:35,396 --> 01:01:37,872
- Toast! Toast!
- Toast! Toast!

883
01:01:37,921 --> 01:01:41,060
Now, this is a big win, but we
still got a lot of work to do.

884
01:01:44,357 --> 01:01:46,396
Okay, toasts!

885
01:01:46,654 --> 01:01:48,185
Give me that, Doug!

886
01:01:48,521 --> 01:01:52,138
To the man who brought us all together,
our former boss, Tony Stark.

887
01:01:52,154 --> 01:01:53,396
Boo!

888
01:01:53,606 --> 01:01:55,136
The jester king.

889
01:01:55,245 --> 01:02:02,160
Literally wrapped, in wealth and
technology that he was unfit to wield.

890
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:05,294
Like the holographic system I designed.
A revolutionary breakthrough,

891
01:02:05,338 --> 01:02:07,778
with limitless applications,
that Tony turned

892
01:02:07,803 --> 01:02:10,058
into a self-therapy
machine and renamed...

893
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:14,364
Binarily Augmented
Retro-Framing, or BARF...

894
01:02:16,771 --> 01:02:21,138
611 million dollars, for my
little therapeutic experiment?

895
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:24,981
He renamed my life's work, BARF.

896
01:02:25,548 --> 01:02:29,876
I told him that it was a mistake. That
my technology can change the world.

897
01:02:30,768 --> 01:02:32,353
And then...

898
01:02:32,893 --> 01:02:34,783
He fired me.

899
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:39,768
Said I was... unstable.

900
01:02:41,138 --> 01:02:43,622
- To Tony!
- To Tony!

901
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,348
Next, to William.

902
01:02:47,668 --> 01:02:53,723
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

903
01:02:54,099 --> 01:02:58,278
The integration of my illusion tech, with
your weaponized drones, was brilliant.

904
01:02:58,302 --> 01:03:01,005
Powerful illusions, real
damage, worked like a charm.

905
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:03,263
- And it's just the beginning.
- Thank you, brother.

906
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:05,598
- To Guterman.
- To Guterman!

907
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:08,085
The story you created of a
soldier from another earth

908
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:11,820
named Quentin fighting space monsters
in Europe, is totally ridiculous!

909
01:03:11,883 --> 01:03:14,530
And apparently exactly the kind of
thing people will believe right now.

910
01:03:14,555 --> 01:03:16,828
I mean, everybody bought it.

911
01:03:18,032 --> 01:03:20,148
- To Victoria.
- To Victoria!

912
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:22,601
Staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack sites with

913
01:03:22,626 --> 01:03:26,446
Fury's own satellites to
confirm our lies? Inspired idea.

914
01:03:26,517 --> 01:03:28,430
- To Janice!
- Janice!

915
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:30,766
After Tony died, she was
the one who discovered

916
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:33,335
that EDITH was being
handed over not to us,

917
01:03:33,367 --> 01:03:36,234
not to the Defense
Department, but to a child.

918
01:03:36,282 --> 01:03:37,867
- Thank you!
- To Janice!

919
01:03:37,977 --> 01:03:40,703
To the rest of you,
Tony Stark is gone.

920
01:03:40,728 --> 01:03:43,962
There is a window of opportunity
and someone will step up.

921
01:03:44,062 --> 01:03:46,037
But these days, you can
be the smartest guy in

922
01:03:46,062 --> 01:03:48,851
the room, the most
qualified, and no one cares.

923
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,918
Unless you're flying around
with a cape, or shooting

924
01:03:50,944 --> 01:03:55,093
lasers from your hands,
no one will even listen.

925
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,967
Well, I've got a cape.
And lasers.

926
01:04:01,561 --> 01:04:03,739
With our technology,
and with EDITH,

927
01:04:03,764 --> 01:04:08,834
Mysterio will be, the
greatest hero on Earth.

928
01:04:09,897 --> 01:04:12,943
And everyone, will listen.

929
01:04:14,366 --> 01:04:18,482
- Not to a, boozey man-child.
- No!

930
01:04:19,006 --> 01:04:22,693
- Not, to a hormonal teenager.
- No!

931
01:04:23,896 --> 01:04:28,184
To me! And, to my
very wealthy crew.

932
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:30,225
- To us.
- To us!

933
01:04:30,528 --> 01:04:33,693
- To Mysterio!
- To Mysterio!

934
01:04:33,772 --> 01:04:36,762
- To Peter Parker.
- To Peter Parker!

935
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:39,068
Poor kid.

936
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:42,357
Let's get to work.

937
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,943
- Peter!
- Oh, my God!

938
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:50,554
- We almost died!
- It's fine. It's fine.

939
01:04:50,602 --> 01:04:52,492
Hey, guess what. I'm
done with the mission.

940
01:04:52,517 --> 01:04:54,610
- Dude, the trip's over.
- What?

941
01:04:54,635 --> 01:04:56,259
There's monsters coming out
of the ground everywhere

942
01:04:56,284 --> 01:04:58,189
we go. Of course our parents
would want us home.

943
01:04:58,197 --> 01:05:01,501
Please, don't put me on hold.
Oh, Peter! You're not dead!

944
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:04,110
Oh, my God. Yes. Good, stay here.
Don't die.

945
01:05:04,135 --> 01:05:06,542
Put some clothes on.
We're booking flights.

946
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:10,785
Came for science, we're leaving because
of witches. Welcome to the new dark ages.

947
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:15,195
- What's going on, dude?
- We're going home in the morning.

948
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:17,417
No. No, no, no. All the
Elementals are gone.

949
01:05:17,442 --> 01:05:18,173
Ned?

950
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:19,775
Coming, sweetie.

951
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:22,845
Can you guys keep it down?
I'm livestreaming.

952
01:05:25,538 --> 01:05:26,538
Hey.

953
01:05:27,397 --> 01:05:28,280
Hey.

954
01:05:28,305 --> 01:05:31,813
- Where were you?
- Um.. I got lost...

955
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:33,931
They were worried about you.

956
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:37,134
- Good thing you're back.
- Yeah.

957
01:05:37,548 --> 01:05:40,282
- So much for Paris, right?
- It would've been fun.

958
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:41,118
Yeah...

959
01:05:41,462 --> 01:05:43,047
- 'Night.
- 'Night.

960
01:05:44,603 --> 01:05:46,274
You look ni...

961
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:57,644
- Hey.
- Hey.

962
01:05:58,008 --> 01:06:00,031
Uh... Look, um...

963
01:06:00,637 --> 01:06:03,337
I'm not ready for this
trip to be over yet, and

964
01:06:03,362 --> 01:06:06,356
I kinda wanna do something
fun, that's not on

965
01:06:06,381 --> 01:06:09,150
the itinerary or planned,
or with Mr. Harrington...

966
01:06:09,162 --> 01:06:10,466
Yes.

967
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:13,663
Yes, like, you wanna go?

968
01:06:13,693 --> 01:06:14,819
Yes.

969
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:18,687
Okay. Awesome. I'll see you
outside in ten minutes?

970
01:06:18,734 --> 01:06:20,867
Meet me outside in five minutes.

971
01:06:21,497 --> 01:06:23,044
- Five is good.
- Okay.

972
01:06:23,068 --> 01:06:24,552
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

973
01:06:40,422 --> 01:06:41,422
- Hey.
- Hey.

974
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:44,228
- So, where do you wanna go?
- Who cares?

975
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:45,189
- Awesome.
- Okay.

976
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:46,214
Let's go.

977
01:06:52,485 --> 01:06:55,108
- I'm glad we're doing this.
- Yeah. Me, too.

978
01:06:55,133 --> 01:06:57,524
Just see the city a little bit.

979
01:06:57,633 --> 01:07:00,561
You know they used to execute people?
On this bridge?

980
01:07:00,586 --> 01:07:04,187
They were like... in a basket and
they would drown in the water.

981
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,242
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

982
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:10,883
Uhh...

983
01:07:11,859 --> 01:07:17,781
Look, there was this thing that I've been
wanting to talk to you about for... a while.

984
01:07:19,007 --> 01:07:20,007
Yeah?

985
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:25,455
It's our last night in Europe, and I
had this plan that I wanted to...

986
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:29,173
tell you... I'm just gonna,
I'm just gonna tell you...

987
01:07:31,103 --> 01:07:33,860
- MJ, I...
- am Spider-Man.

988
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:35,664
What?

989
01:07:35,689 --> 01:07:38,290
I just figured you were gonna
say that you're Spider-Man.

990
01:07:39,164 --> 01:07:40,164
No.

991
01:07:41,069 --> 01:07:42,412
I'm not Spider-Man.

992
01:07:42,577 --> 01:07:47,920
I mean, I've been watching you for like,
a while now. It's... kind of obvious.

993
01:07:48,874 --> 01:07:52,303
I'm not Spider-Man. I mean, what would
make you think that I was Spider-Man?

994
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,537
- Peter, Washington?
- Yeah?

995
01:07:54,606 --> 01:07:58,405
The fact that you like, disappear?
Out of nowhere? For no reason?

996
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,169
No, that was, I was sick.
Remember?

997
01:08:00,194 --> 01:08:01,132
I had my... the tummy?

998
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:03,125
You know Suzan Yang thinks
that you're a male escort?

999
01:08:03,172 --> 01:08:05,131
What? No, of course I'm
not a male escort.

1000
01:08:05,156 --> 01:08:08,675
- Well then, you're Spider-Man.
- No, I'm not Spider-Man. At all.

1001
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,840
Well, what about tonight? When you snuck
off and fought that thing, I saw you.

1002
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:14,394
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1003
01:08:14,434 --> 01:08:17,178
And also, on the news,
it was the Night-Monkey.

1004
01:08:17,203 --> 01:08:20,293
- The Night-Monkey?
- Yeah. That's what it said on the news.

1005
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:23,227
And the news, never lies.

1006
01:08:24,099 --> 01:08:25,802
Night-Monkey. Okay.

1007
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:27,754
What are you doing?

1008
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:32,519
Well, do the Night-Monkey and
Spider-Man use the same webs?

1009
01:08:33,438 --> 01:08:35,078
I mean, maybe.

1010
01:08:35,289 --> 01:08:37,734
Maybe he's a Spider-Monkey.
Who knows?

1011
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:45,320
Were you only watching me because
you thought I was Spider-Man?

1012
01:08:47,955 --> 01:08:48,955
Yeah.

1013
01:08:50,203 --> 01:08:52,338
Why else would I
be watching you?

1014
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:55,662
Doesn't matter.

1015
01:08:56,162 --> 01:08:57,748
Just thought that maybe...

1016
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:04,862
The hell was that?

1017
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:07,877
I don't know.

1018
01:09:18,466 --> 01:09:21,341
What is it, like some kind
of projector or something?

1019
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:24,887
Yeah, but it's really advanced.

1020
01:09:24,934 --> 01:09:27,699
It... It looked so real...

1021
01:09:28,073 --> 01:09:29,925
Yeah, really real.

1022
01:09:30,354 --> 01:09:33,510
- Wait a minute, does that mean that...
- The Elementals are fake?

1023
01:09:34,165 --> 01:09:36,790
That doesn't make any sense,
because we were there, right?

1024
01:09:37,071 --> 01:09:40,063
There was fire, and
destruction, and...

1025
01:09:41,766 --> 01:09:43,966
Who would do
something like that?

1026
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:54,757
Mysterio?

1027
01:09:59,064 --> 01:10:01,025
I am Spider-Man...

1028
01:10:01,535 --> 01:10:02,971
And I really messed up.

1029
01:10:03,018 --> 01:10:05,485
Wait, you're being
serious right now?

1030
01:10:05,845 --> 01:10:08,409
You're not joking with me? Like you're
100% serious? Because it's not funny.

1031
01:10:08,434 --> 01:10:11,846
- No. I'm not joking.
- Because I was only like 67% sure.

1032
01:10:11,878 --> 01:10:13,713
- MJ...
- So, why are you here?

1033
01:10:13,729 --> 01:10:15,026
Why are you on
this school trip?

1034
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:16,691
MJ, look, I know you
have a lot of questions.

1035
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:18,401
But look, we really have
to get out of here, okay?

1036
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,002
Okay. Okay.

1037
01:10:20,628 --> 01:10:22,698
I can't believe I
figured it out!

1038
01:10:23,901 --> 01:10:25,955
You took everything from me!

1039
01:10:26,769 --> 01:10:28,417
This is for my family.

1040
01:10:35,241 --> 01:10:36,241
Pause.

1041
01:10:38,288 --> 01:10:39,288
Pause?

1042
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:41,436
Sorry.

1043
01:10:41,847 --> 01:10:44,352
Yeah, uhh, can you just
fast-forward to the end?

1044
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:45,761
Yeah. Standby.

1045
01:10:50,017 --> 01:10:52,813
Right. Fly, fly, fly...
Zap, zap, zap...

1046
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,165
Pause.

1047
01:10:54,439 --> 01:10:56,540
I'm not in love with this
choreography but it'll do.

1048
01:10:56,565 --> 01:10:59,658
Kill image. Decloak drones.

1049
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:02,880
Right, weapons?

1050
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:04,950
- You wanna weaponize them?
- Yup.

1051
01:11:04,991 --> 01:11:06,725
Weapons only. Standby.

1052
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,750
Nice.

1053
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:18,429
Stop.

1054
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:21,678
Something... I don't know what it is.
It's something...

1055
01:11:21,703 --> 01:11:23,531
Just... you know what?

1056
01:11:24,266 --> 01:11:26,480
Double the damage. And
then run it again.

1057
01:11:26,505 --> 01:11:27,848
You want me to double it up?

1058
01:11:27,872 --> 01:11:30,715
- Yeah.
- Alright. Cover your ears.

1059
01:11:40,241 --> 01:11:42,139
Good. That's good.

1060
01:11:42,655 --> 01:11:44,560
- We're on schedule?
- Oh, yeah.

1061
01:11:44,585 --> 01:11:46,858
Uploading software
hack to EDITH network,

1062
01:11:46,898 --> 01:11:50,648
where drones will be able to create an
event big enough to cover an entire city.

1063
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:54,243
Right, well done. Make sure every drone
is weapons hot. We need maximum damage.

1064
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,320
That's gonna cause a
lot of casualties.

1065
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:58,462
Oh, yeah. More casualties,
more coverage.

1066
01:11:58,504 --> 01:12:00,559
I gotta cut through the static.
London is a beautiful

1067
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:02,529
city and it will suffer
but they can rebuild.

1068
01:12:02,637 --> 01:12:05,027
If I'm gonna be the next
Iron Man, I need to

1069
01:12:05,052 --> 01:12:07,653
save the world from an
Avengers-level threat.

1070
01:12:08,606 --> 01:12:14,598
But, when its new saviour descends, all
those casualties will be forgotten.

1071
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:18,387
Janice, you'll be in position with my
quick change armor? For the victory lap.

1072
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:21,027
- Of course. Do you want to try...
- No, no. That's...

1073
01:12:21,052 --> 01:12:23,605
What's going on with my hand?
Why is that happening?

1074
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,661
Oh, one of the drones
that came back from the

1075
01:12:25,686 --> 01:12:28,092
plaza was missing a projector.
It's fine.

1076
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:31,537
Wait, and you're... You're
telling me this, now?

1077
01:12:31,837 --> 01:12:35,071
It's one drone. The image
will be perfect, I promise.

1078
01:12:35,096 --> 01:12:36,993
That projector is evidence.
It's going to tell

1079
01:12:37,018 --> 01:12:38,993
people what we're doing
and how we're doing it.

1080
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:43,290
I am trying, to fool seven billion
people here, including Nick Fury,

1081
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:46,932
who happens to be the most paranoid and
most dangerous person on the planet.

1082
01:12:46,957 --> 01:12:50,049
And if he catches on before I've killed
him, then he will put a bullet in my head.

1083
01:12:50,089 --> 01:12:52,784
And nobody wants a bullet
in their head. Right?

1084
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:56,096
Right?

1085
01:12:58,229 --> 01:13:00,096
William, can you look at me?

1086
01:13:02,248 --> 01:13:03,549
Pull up EDITH.

1087
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:07,143
- Hello, Quentin.
- Yeah. Hi, honey.

1088
01:13:07,168 --> 01:13:10,285
I need a level 5 search full
resource protocol for this device.

1089
01:13:10,426 --> 01:13:11,925
Magnifying...

1090
01:13:12,926 --> 01:13:16,035
There. Search everything going
in and out of that building.

1091
01:13:16,245 --> 01:13:17,472
Located.

1092
01:13:18,972 --> 01:13:20,128
Shit.

1093
01:13:23,169 --> 01:13:28,004
You know William, one day, after I've had
to kill Peter Parker because of this...

1094
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:32,161
I hope you remember, that his
blood, is on your hands!

1095
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:38,747
I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses.
I mean, how can I be so stupid?

1096
01:13:38,772 --> 01:13:42,182
He's probably spying on me right now or
sending a drone to come and kill me.

1097
01:13:42,504 --> 01:13:45,074
You had access to killer drones?

1098
01:13:45,099 --> 01:13:48,309
Yeah, I didn't really want them
especially after I almost killed Brad.

1099
01:13:48,662 --> 01:13:51,018
- You almost killed Brad?
- Look...

1100
01:13:51,043 --> 01:13:54,052
I have to call Mr. Fury and tell
him that Beck's a fraud, but...

1101
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:56,747
- I think he tapped my phone number.
- Okay, so what are you gonna do?

1102
01:13:57,537 --> 01:14:00,404
I need my suit, and I
have to go to Berlin,

1103
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,779
and talk to Mr. Fury in person.

1104
01:14:27,478 --> 01:14:28,837
Oh, Ned. Perfect.

1105
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,337
The costume looks great! For...

1106
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:36,087
For the costume party,
at the princess castle...

1107
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:37,586
She knows. I told her.

1108
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:40,236
He didn't tell me.
I figured it out.

1109
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:42,150
Oh.

1110
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:45,106
- That's cool.
- Like, a long time ago.

1111
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:48,476
Look, Mysterio was a fraud.

1112
01:14:48,501 --> 01:14:50,492
But he saved me and
Betty's lives...

1113
01:14:50,517 --> 01:14:52,612
No, he's been faking the whole
thing with illusion tech.

1114
01:14:52,637 --> 01:14:55,199
Yeah, he's using these,
like, hologram projectors.

1115
01:14:55,254 --> 01:14:57,909
Whoa. That's... crazy.

1116
01:14:57,934 --> 01:14:58,855
Yeah...

1117
01:15:01,192 --> 01:15:04,277
So, you guys were like, working
the case together, or what?

1118
01:15:04,302 --> 01:15:05,692
It's been mostly me.

1119
01:15:06,145 --> 01:15:08,472
Look, Ned, I need you to call May,
get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1120
01:15:08,497 --> 01:15:11,480
say that she wanted me to stay with family
in Berlin until this all blows over. Okay?

1121
01:15:11,528 --> 01:15:12,846
Got it. Easy.

1122
01:15:12,871 --> 01:15:15,183
Wow. You guys lie
with such ease.

1123
01:15:15,801 --> 01:15:16,801
Gotta go.

1124
01:15:17,202 --> 01:15:19,335
Wait, wait, wait...
the projector.

1125
01:15:19,355 --> 01:15:20,889
You're gonna need this.

1126
01:15:21,739 --> 01:15:24,941
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?
Anyone who knows is in danger.

1127
01:15:33,103 --> 01:15:34,658
So, you know, too.

1128
01:15:35,101 --> 01:15:36,804
It's cool. Um... I mean,
I've known first and

1129
01:15:36,829 --> 01:15:39,783
I've known longer, but
it's not a competition.

1130
01:16:00,591 --> 01:16:03,333
- Excuse me, do you know where...
- Night-Monkey!

1131
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:05,795
No, wait, I didn't...
Oh, man.

1132
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:09,848
Get in.

1133
01:16:16,221 --> 01:16:19,377
- Mr. Fury...
- You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1134
01:16:19,402 --> 01:16:22,049
- No, no, no. Listen...
- Wait until we're secure.

1135
01:16:22,339 --> 01:16:23,339
Okay.

1136
01:16:28,862 --> 01:16:29,862
Right.

1137
01:16:55,139 --> 01:16:56,139
So...

1138
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:59,619
Is there anything you want to
tell us about your girlfriend?

1139
01:16:59,674 --> 01:17:01,205
He's talking about EDITH.

1140
01:17:01,276 --> 01:17:04,242
Look, I know I made a mistake, and I'm
sorry but he is not who you think he is.

1141
01:17:04,267 --> 01:17:07,113
Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the
Elementals, it's all fake.

1142
01:17:07,138 --> 01:17:09,054
He has some sort of illusion
tech, and that's how he

1143
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:11,360
tricked you guys and he tricked
me into giving him EDITH.

1144
01:17:12,124 --> 01:17:13,327
It's a projector.

1145
01:17:13,806 --> 01:17:15,763
I pulled it off the
fire monster in Prague.

1146
01:17:15,788 --> 01:17:20,480
So all that death and destruction
we witnessed was created by this?

1147
01:17:20,505 --> 01:17:23,113
No, not just this. I
think he's using drones.

1148
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:28,309
Well, if this is true then Beck's very
dangerous and we need to be smart.

1149
01:17:28,334 --> 01:17:30,435
Who else did you
tell about this?

1150
01:17:30,926 --> 01:17:33,122
Parker? Parker!

1151
01:17:33,471 --> 01:17:36,138
- What's wrong?
- It's Beck. He's here.

1152
01:17:36,163 --> 01:17:37,163
What?

1153
01:17:37,299 --> 01:17:38,299
Hill?

1154
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:44,634
No, it's just an ill...

1155
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:47,495
Fury!

1156
01:17:52,573 --> 01:17:54,448
Wow, Peter. Wow.

1157
01:17:55,208 --> 01:17:56,808
I thought we were close.

1158
01:17:57,268 --> 01:18:00,330
Fury always had to die.
But not you.

1159
01:18:00,807 --> 01:18:02,440
Stop hiding, Beck!

1160
01:18:04,511 --> 01:18:08,831
I tried to help you walk away.
Now you're making me do this.

1161
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:16,067
You told me, you
were just a kid.

1162
01:18:17,286 --> 01:18:20,591
You told me, you wanted
to run after that girl.

1163
01:18:20,616 --> 01:18:22,022
- Help me!
- MJ!

1164
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:28,508
Peter? What's going on?

1165
01:18:28,533 --> 01:18:31,220
- I know this isn't real.
- Do you, though?

1166
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:33,564
MJ!

1167
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:35,377
MJ!

1168
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:41,228
I don't think you know
what's real, Peter.

1169
01:18:54,338 --> 01:18:55,923
You need to wake up!

1170
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:20,976
I mean, look at yourself.

1171
01:19:31,128 --> 01:19:35,135
You, are just a scared
little kid in a sweatsuit!

1172
01:19:36,776 --> 01:19:41,354
I created Mysterio to give the
world someone to believe in.

1173
01:19:41,931 --> 01:19:46,143
I control the truth!
Mysterio is the truth.

1174
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:13,538
If you were good enough, maybe
Tony would still be alive.

1175
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:29,573
Deep down, you know I'm right.

1176
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,685
You made your choice.

1177
01:20:43,053 --> 01:20:45,225
All you had to do
was step aside.

1178
01:20:46,287 --> 01:20:48,982
And now, you ha...

1179
01:21:00,972 --> 01:21:01,981
Fury!

1180
01:21:02,855 --> 01:21:07,722
Beck's people... We're trying to find
everyone who could expose him.

1181
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:11,652
Who'd you tell? I know
you told someone.

1182
01:21:11,676 --> 01:21:12,676
- So, just tell me...
- Okay...

1183
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,529
Who did you tell? Who
else did you tell?

1184
01:21:15,554 --> 01:21:19,802
Just Ned and MJ from my class, and maybe Ned
told his girlfriend Betty, but that's it.

1185
01:21:21,342 --> 01:21:22,342
What?

1186
01:21:22,718 --> 01:21:26,109
- You... are so gullible.
- What?

1187
01:21:26,156 --> 01:21:29,265
I mean, you're smart as a whip.
Just a...

1188
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:30,634
sucker.

1189
01:21:31,742 --> 01:21:33,671
Now all your friends
have to die.

1190
01:21:38,357 --> 01:21:41,818
It's easy to fool people when
they're already fooling themselves.

1191
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:49,018
But for what it's worth, Peter...

1192
01:21:50,317 --> 01:21:51,979
I really am sorry.

1193
01:22:01,504 --> 01:22:02,660
- EDITH?
- Yes, Quentin?

1194
01:22:02,685 --> 01:22:05,214
Access files to Peter
Parker's class trip.

1195
01:22:06,323 --> 01:22:08,011
I need them to fly
home from London.

1196
01:22:47,932 --> 01:22:48,932
Hi!

1197
01:22:49,994 --> 01:22:51,189
Where am I?

1198
01:22:51,571 --> 01:22:53,371
Municipal holding facility.

1199
01:22:53,623 --> 01:22:57,607
They said they found you unconscious
at the train yard. Very dangerous.

1200
01:22:57,647 --> 01:23:00,779
We gave you the shirt because
you seemed a bit cold.

1201
01:23:01,102 --> 01:23:02,102
Thanks.

1202
01:23:04,552 --> 01:23:05,802
You guys are nice.

1203
01:23:06,903 --> 01:23:08,755
You speak really good English.

1204
01:23:08,927 --> 01:23:10,727
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1205
01:23:11,506 --> 01:23:14,653
- I'm in the Netherlands right now?
- Yup.

1206
01:23:17,673 --> 01:23:18,673
Guard?

1207
01:23:18,975 --> 01:23:21,365
The guard's on a break.
Probably talking to his wife.

1208
01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:23,615
- Yeah. She's pregnant.
- Oh, yeah?

1209
01:23:32,364 --> 01:23:33,364
Yeah.

1210
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:34,880
Yeah.

1211
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:37,778
Night-Monkey. Yeah.

1212
01:23:42,286 --> 01:23:43,738
You guys okay?

1213
01:23:55,953 --> 01:23:59,153
Excuse me, sir? Can I
borrow your phone?

1214
01:24:01,118 --> 01:24:02,985
Everyone's so nice here.

1215
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:11,199
Okay...

1216
01:24:12,988 --> 01:24:16,105
Pick up, pick up pick up...
Hey. Hey! Uh...

1217
01:24:17,226 --> 01:24:19,826
I messed up. I need a...
I need a ride.

1218
01:24:20,838 --> 01:24:22,971
Where am I? Uh...
where am I, sir?

1219
01:24:27,406 --> 01:24:29,546
Hang on, could you
say that into there?

1220
01:24:29,617 --> 01:24:30,617
Hi, it's...

1221
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:34,868
No problem.

1222
01:24:35,634 --> 01:24:36,634
Thanks.

1223
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:38,477
Did you get that?

1224
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,848
Peter? Are you okay?

1225
01:25:01,873 --> 01:25:04,606
- Happy, is that you?
- Is it me? Yeah, of course it's me!

1226
01:25:04,631 --> 01:25:05,810
Stop!

1227
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:09,007
Tell me something
only you would know.

1228
01:25:09,032 --> 01:25:10,813
Only I would know...

1229
01:25:11,819 --> 01:25:15,388
Remember when we went to Germany? You
pay-per-viewed a video in your room?

1230
01:25:15,413 --> 01:25:17,151
They didn't list the titles,
but I could tell by the price,

1231
01:25:17,176 --> 01:25:19,597
it was an adult film at the front
desk and you didn't know how I knew?

1232
01:25:19,622 --> 01:25:22,160
Okay! Okay, fine. It's you.
It's you, stop.

1233
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:26,800
It's so good to see you.

1234
01:25:28,037 --> 01:25:30,810
Peter, you've got to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

1235
01:25:31,573 --> 01:25:34,240
Okay. Hold still. Here we go.

1236
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,640
Ouch.

1237
01:25:41,758 --> 01:25:43,441
I thought you had
super-strength?

1238
01:25:43,466 --> 01:25:44,929
It still hurts.

1239
01:25:47,667 --> 01:25:49,604
All right, relax.

1240
01:25:51,284 --> 01:25:52,588
Just a few more...
There we go.

1241
01:25:52,613 --> 01:25:53,983
- Oh, my God!
- Relax!

1242
01:25:54,008 --> 01:25:57,784
Don't tell me to relax, Happy. How
can I relax when I messed up so bad?

1243
01:25:58,691 --> 01:26:00,972
I trusted Beck. Right?

1244
01:26:01,285 --> 01:26:04,779
I thought he was my friend, so I gave him
the only thing Mr. Stark left behind for me

1245
01:26:04,804 --> 01:26:07,442
and now he's gonna kill my friends
and half of Europe, so please,

1246
01:26:07,467 --> 01:26:09,655
do not tell me to relax.

1247
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,744
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't shout.

1248
01:26:17,602 --> 01:26:19,135
I just really miss him.

1249
01:26:20,110 --> 01:26:21,758
Yeah, I miss him, too.

1250
01:26:24,525 --> 01:26:26,181
Everywhere I go...

1251
01:26:27,268 --> 01:26:29,510
I see his face. And...

1252
01:26:29,978 --> 01:26:33,228
the whole world is asking who
is gonna be the next Iron Man?

1253
01:26:36,072 --> 01:26:38,993
I don't know if that's me, Happy.
I'm not Iron Man.

1254
01:26:41,335 --> 01:26:42,841
You're not Iron Man.

1255
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:45,630
You're never gonna be Iron Man.

1256
01:26:47,534 --> 01:26:49,467
Nobody could live up to Tony.

1257
01:26:49,822 --> 01:26:51,205
Not even Tony.

1258
01:26:52,936 --> 01:26:56,193
Tony was my best friend.
And he was a mess.

1259
01:26:56,417 --> 01:26:59,436
He second-guessed everything he did.
He was all over the place.

1260
01:27:00,482 --> 01:27:03,880
The one thing that he did that he
didn't second-guess was picking you.

1261
01:27:05,688 --> 01:27:08,477
I don't think Tony would've
done what he did...

1262
01:27:09,196 --> 01:27:12,078
if he didn't know that you were
gonna be here after he was gone.

1263
01:27:14,205 --> 01:27:18,587
Your friends are in trouble. You're
all alone. The tech is missing.

1264
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:22,536
What are you gonna do about it?

1265
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:29,570
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1266
01:27:29,683 --> 01:27:32,280
No, I mean, right now. Like,
specifically, what are we gonna do?

1267
01:27:32,305 --> 01:27:35,562
Because we've been hovering over a tulip
field for the last fifteen minutes.

1268
01:27:35,586 --> 01:27:38,890
Right. I can't call my friends because
he's tracking their phones...

1269
01:27:38,969 --> 01:27:40,940
- Give me your phone?
- My cell phone?

1270
01:27:40,965 --> 01:27:43,315
- Yeah.
- Okay. Here.

1271
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,759
- What's your password?
- "password".

1272
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:47,054
No, what is your password?

1273
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:48,915
Password. The word. Spell that.
Password.

1274
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:51,008
You're the head of security and
your password is password?

1275
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:52,305
I don't feel good
about it either.

1276
01:27:52,331 --> 01:27:55,767
'Ello, guv'nor! Cup o' tea for you?
I'mma be in London.

1277
01:27:55,792 --> 01:27:57,680
- They're in London.
- London? Okay.

1278
01:27:57,705 --> 01:27:59,931
- Yeah, I need a suit!
- Suit?

1279
01:28:21,327 --> 01:28:22,868
Okay... um...

1280
01:28:23,323 --> 01:28:25,863
Bring up everything you
have on Spider-Man.

1281
01:28:32,819 --> 01:28:35,765
Yeah, open that. Okay.
No, no, no.

1282
01:28:43,293 --> 01:28:45,231
- What?
- Nothing.

1283
01:28:45,935 --> 01:28:48,716
You take care of the suit.
I'll take care of the music.

1284
01:28:52,742 --> 01:28:54,570
Oh! I love Led Zeppelin!

1285
01:29:00,088 --> 01:29:02,621
Okay, can you pull
up my web shooters?

1286
01:29:03,763 --> 01:29:07,327
Isolate the taser webs and reconfigure
and boost the voltage to a

1287
01:29:07,352 --> 01:29:13,921
factor of 25%, and with complete
manual control over detonation.

1288
01:29:16,769 --> 01:29:19,767
I thought Kree having sleeper
cells was top-secret information?

1289
01:29:19,792 --> 01:29:22,862
Nick... satellites are
picking up an E.M. pulse.

1290
01:29:22,909 --> 01:29:24,509
I thought that was over.

1291
01:29:24,534 --> 01:29:26,190
- It's the biggest one yet.
- Where?

1292
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:27,424
London.

1293
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:30,954
Okay guys. The company set up a city
tour, and then we'll grab a bite,

1294
01:29:30,979 --> 01:29:32,808
then head to the airport.

1295
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:37,949
Is no one else gonna
acknowledge how crazy this is?

1296
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:41,808
I get it. There's been nothing scientific
about this science tour at all.

1297
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:43,377
No, no, no. I'm
talking about Peter.

1298
01:29:43,402 --> 01:29:45,511
Has no one else here
noticed how shady he is?

1299
01:29:45,536 --> 01:29:49,179
Because I saw him in the bathroom of a
reststop with some woman in his underwear,

1300
01:29:49,204 --> 01:29:52,680
and he's always sneaking away.
Like back at the opera? Huh?

1301
01:29:52,705 --> 01:29:56,251
And now what, he's suddenly off the trip?
With his family in Berlin?

1302
01:29:56,276 --> 01:29:59,001
Is no one else here
interested in the truth?

1303
01:29:59,838 --> 01:30:03,549
"The very concept of objective
truth is fading out of the world."

1304
01:30:03,574 --> 01:30:05,842
George Orwell. Thank you, MJ.

1305
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:09,186
Yeah, well. I mean, since Peter's
not really here to tell his truth,

1306
01:30:09,211 --> 01:30:11,529
what about you, Brad? Why
do you think it's cool

1307
01:30:11,554 --> 01:30:13,234
to take pictures of
people in the bathroom?

1308
01:30:13,259 --> 01:30:14,920
Yeah, dude.
What's that about?

1309
01:30:14,945 --> 01:30:17,296
No, no. It wasn't like that.
It was...

1310
01:30:17,687 --> 01:30:18,687
I was trying to take...

1311
01:30:18,712 --> 01:30:23,789
Let's just put all this craziness behind
us, and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.

1312
01:30:23,814 --> 01:30:26,321
"Sounds great, Mr.
Harrington!", said the class.

1313
01:30:26,398 --> 01:30:27,398
Okay.

1314
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:30,265
I'm gonna be a cool
teacher right now...

1315
01:30:30,803 --> 01:30:33,476
You've got to stop doing that, okay?
It is weird.

1316
01:30:33,591 --> 01:30:37,848
No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls. Okay?

1317
01:30:37,873 --> 01:30:40,278
- Look at this!
- Mr. Harrington. Come along.

1318
01:30:40,303 --> 01:30:43,419
- We got a bus all to ourselves!
- Nice to see you all. Come along.

1319
01:30:45,445 --> 01:30:46,445
Thank you.

1320
01:30:48,309 --> 01:30:49,309
All right!

1321
01:30:50,087 --> 01:30:51,469
I have the kids.

1322
01:30:55,579 --> 01:30:58,610
I got here as fast as I could.
I did a full perimeter sweep.

1323
01:30:58,884 --> 01:31:00,133
Nothing.

1324
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:01,829
Damn it.

1325
01:31:04,136 --> 01:31:05,464
Pulse is spiking.

1326
01:31:05,489 --> 01:31:08,504
- I'll take another look.
- Soon as you see something, report.

1327
01:31:08,895 --> 01:31:10,988
You're all we got, Beck.

1328
01:31:11,153 --> 01:31:13,551
This is what I fear.
May God help us, Fury.

1329
01:31:14,918 --> 01:31:16,574
God help us all.

1330
01:31:17,588 --> 01:31:19,732
Okay people, no Avengers coming.
We're good to go.

1331
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,595
- William, launch the drones.
- Copy that, brother.

1332
01:31:22,627 --> 01:31:25,827
Drones are entering the
atmosphere, weapons hot.

1333
01:31:31,777 --> 01:31:33,854
- Excellent. Janice?
- I'm still working on the cape.

1334
01:31:33,879 --> 01:31:35,112
You got to get those wrinkles
out in a few hours. I

1335
01:31:35,137 --> 01:31:37,112
could literally be shaking
hands with the Queen.

1336
01:31:37,137 --> 01:31:38,627
- Guterman?
- Almost in position.

1337
01:31:38,652 --> 01:31:39,768
Okay. Hit it,
Victoria.

1338
01:31:39,807 --> 01:31:41,049
Increasing pulse.

1339
01:31:43,329 --> 01:31:46,454
Whatever this thing is, it's a hundred
times bigger than the previous ones.

1340
01:31:46,569 --> 01:31:49,022
- EDITH?
- Yes, Quentin?

1341
01:31:49,298 --> 01:31:51,360
Show me my loose ends.

1342
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:54,743
Once the show's going, execute
a kill order on my command.

1343
01:31:54,768 --> 01:31:57,133
- Copy.
- Alright. Start the show.

1344
01:31:58,868 --> 01:32:01,204
Let's save the world, people.

1345
01:32:03,453 --> 01:32:05,704
I don't like this.
Something's definitely up.

1346
01:32:06,414 --> 01:32:08,124
You're an F.O.S. now.

1347
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:11,918
Friend of Spider-Man. And you
have to remember, just stay calm.

1348
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:17,533
That doesn't look good.

1349
01:32:17,703 --> 01:32:20,289
But it's fake, so there's
nothing to worry about.

1350
01:32:20,314 --> 01:32:23,274
The kids are in the kill zone.

1351
01:32:23,954 --> 01:32:25,594
Great work, Guterman.

1352
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:30,222
- What?
- Happy here. Happy Hogan here.

1353
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:31,260
I know. What do you want?

1354
01:32:31,285 --> 01:32:33,245
Oh, great. Mr. Stark was going
through his belongings,

1355
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:35,597
apparently he owes a surfboard
that you left behind.

1356
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:36,910
- What?
- People over there said

1357
01:32:36,935 --> 01:32:38,438
they didn't think that
Nick Fury's a surfer.

1358
01:32:38,463 --> 01:32:39,928
The guy says, appearances
can be deceiving.

1359
01:32:39,953 --> 01:32:42,922
It's not mine. And don't ever
call this number again.

1360
01:32:51,137 --> 01:32:53,683
Okay, Fury's got
the coded message.

1361
01:32:54,129 --> 01:32:55,678
- Your friends are at the Tower Bridge.
- Okay.

1362
01:32:55,703 --> 01:32:57,757
The boy called it the London
Bridge but I figured it out.

1363
01:32:57,782 --> 01:32:59,776
I'm gonna go scoop them up.
Okay?

1364
01:32:59,801 --> 01:33:00,688
- Yeah.
- We're close.

1365
01:33:00,713 --> 01:33:01,883
- We're close.
- How's the suit coming?

1366
01:33:01,908 --> 01:33:03,110
- Almost done.
- Good.

1367
01:33:03,135 --> 01:33:04,735
Wait... Before you go...

1368
01:33:05,962 --> 01:33:08,492
If something happens to me, could
you please give this to MJ?

1369
01:33:08,517 --> 01:33:11,459
You're gonna make it back. You'll give
it to her yourself. Okay? You got this.

1370
01:33:11,484 --> 01:33:13,165
- I got this.
- Now walk me through it.

1371
01:33:13,774 --> 01:33:14,978
I know it's illusion tech, right?

1372
01:33:15,003 --> 01:33:17,659
All I have to do is get on the inside
of the illusion, then I can take it

1373
01:33:17,684 --> 01:33:21,049
down. Find him, and he's just a guy,
so I can take EDITH right back.

1374
01:33:21,151 --> 01:33:23,604
Right. But last time,
you got hit by a train.

1375
01:33:24,081 --> 01:33:26,299
True. But, this time...

1376
01:33:26,717 --> 01:33:28,553
How do I explain
this... uhh...

1377
01:33:28,578 --> 01:33:31,435
- I have like a sixth sense?
- The Peter-tingle.

1378
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:34,716
That's what you're talking about, right?
It's not working, though.

1379
01:33:34,741 --> 01:33:36,786
I heard it wasn't working right now.
Is it?

1380
01:33:36,826 --> 01:33:38,517
It is working. Well, I don't...
I don't know if it's working...

1381
01:33:38,542 --> 01:33:40,850
Okay. So your Peter-tingle.
That's the plan.

1382
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:44,445
I'm gonna go get your friends. You
get that Peter-tingle back online.

1383
01:33:44,914 --> 01:33:46,447
I got this. I got this.

1384
01:34:00,471 --> 01:34:03,271
- Cue the lightning...
- Cuing lightning.

1385
01:34:08,423 --> 01:34:11,219
Sir, is it still safe on the
top or should we all...

1386
01:34:11,244 --> 01:34:13,016
No it's not... All right.

1387
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:16,709
Why did the bus driver stop?

1388
01:34:16,733 --> 01:34:19,163
- The bus driver's gone.
- What?

1389
01:34:19,998 --> 01:34:22,741
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I
have it under control.

1390
01:34:22,766 --> 01:34:24,922
No, no, no. Don't drag
me into this Roger!

1391
01:34:24,947 --> 01:34:26,634
I'm doing my best, Julius!

1392
01:34:28,047 --> 01:34:29,447
The witches are back!

1393
01:34:29,472 --> 01:34:31,641
Oh my God! Get off the bus!

1394
01:34:37,167 --> 01:34:38,967
I got you. Follow me, kids!

1395
01:34:56,473 --> 01:34:58,940
Now that is an
Avengers-level threat.

1396
01:35:15,671 --> 01:35:17,148
- This way!
- This way!

1397
01:35:17,469 --> 01:35:20,484
- Okay! Okay!
- Flash!

1398
01:35:20,844 --> 01:35:22,625
This way, kids! Follow me!

1399
01:35:22,696 --> 01:35:25,976
- It's not real, it's not real!
- That one looks pretty real to me!

1400
01:35:28,116 --> 01:35:32,303
Earth, wind, fire, water... Oh, no.
They've joined forces like Power Rangers!

1401
01:35:32,623 --> 01:35:34,478
- You're thinking of Voltron.
- Who?

1402
01:35:34,503 --> 01:35:36,286
Voltron! You're
thinking of Voltron!

1403
01:35:36,311 --> 01:35:38,998
Hey, look. It's Mysterio!
He's gonna save us.

1404
01:35:42,938 --> 01:35:45,577
- Wait, Mysterio knows we know.
- Then we're in danger.

1405
01:35:45,602 --> 01:35:47,742
So are they. We should go.

1406
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:50,937
Kill that witch!

1407
01:35:52,368 --> 01:35:54,336
This is for my family!

1408
01:35:56,706 --> 01:36:00,336
You should get somewhere safe, Fury.
I don't see this ending well.

1409
01:36:00,368 --> 01:36:04,563
I appreciate your concern. But
I never leave my men behind.

1410
01:36:06,008 --> 01:36:07,178
All right. Comms check.

1411
01:36:07,203 --> 01:36:07,791
You hear me, kid?

1412
01:36:07,816 --> 01:36:09,875
Yeah I can. It's just
a little loud out here.

1413
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,758
- I like the new suit.
- Thanks.

1414
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:13,852
Whoa... Peter, you
sure that's not real?

1415
01:36:13,877 --> 01:36:16,414
Yeah, it's just a hundred
times bigger than I expected.

1416
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:17,985
- Still the play?
- Uh-huh.

1417
01:36:18,010 --> 01:36:20,494
We need to get high enough so
Beck doesn't see me coming.

1418
01:36:20,519 --> 01:36:22,502
Copy. Stay sticky.

1419
01:36:25,674 --> 01:36:27,416
- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah, kid? What is it?

1420
01:36:27,441 --> 01:36:30,049
We need to have a serious
conversation about you and my aunt...

1421
01:36:45,252 --> 01:36:46,956
Beck, report!

1422
01:36:46,981 --> 01:36:49,801
Hey, Guterman. I need a response,
something quick and decisive...

1423
01:36:49,826 --> 01:36:53,113
It's all the Elementals. They
somehow merged into something...

1424
01:36:53,138 --> 01:36:55,270
something else.
Something more powerful.

1425
01:36:55,303 --> 01:36:57,708
It's drawing energy
from the Earth's core.

1426
01:37:02,332 --> 01:37:04,371
See, now that's
some bullshit.

1427
01:37:07,364 --> 01:37:08,746
Is that...?

1428
01:37:13,265 --> 01:37:14,812
Be ready for anything.

1429
01:37:14,952 --> 01:37:15,952
Yeah.

1430
01:37:21,673 --> 01:37:24,032
Ohh, it's not real, it's
not real, it's not real!

1431
01:37:28,743 --> 01:37:32,047
Whoa... That's awesome.

1432
01:37:58,025 --> 01:38:00,121
William, I've got drones
breaking formation.

1433
01:38:00,146 --> 01:38:02,363
Maybe they hit a flock of birds
or something. You're fine.

1434
01:38:02,387 --> 01:38:04,918
Well, I wanna see what's happening there.
I'm taking manual control.

1435
01:38:11,082 --> 01:38:12,416
Do you see anything?

1436
01:38:13,332 --> 01:38:14,332
Yeah.

1437
01:38:15,267 --> 01:38:16,783
And I'm gonna kill him.

1438
01:38:21,256 --> 01:38:22,724
I hope this works!

1439
01:38:39,126 --> 01:38:40,289
You got me?

1440
01:38:45,032 --> 01:38:46,407
I gotcha.

1441
01:38:46,626 --> 01:38:48,758
Boss, the illusion is coming apart.

1442
01:38:52,195 --> 01:38:53,328
I see you.

1443
01:38:57,247 --> 01:38:59,763
- EDITH, give me some protection.
- Copy.

1444
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:15,394
Kill it. Just kill the illusion.
Kill it.

1445
01:39:15,419 --> 01:39:17,080
No. I'm not gonna kill it.
They'll see you.

1446
01:39:17,105 --> 01:39:19,651
They'll see what I
want them to see!

1447
01:39:19,676 --> 01:39:21,893
- Do you still need the cape?
- Yes, Janice.

1448
01:39:22,737 --> 01:39:23,737
I still need the cape.

1449
01:39:24,307 --> 01:39:25,208
Done.

1450
01:39:27,605 --> 01:39:29,324
Now, William, render
my illusion suit.

1451
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,136
Alright, hang on.

1452
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:32,230
The monster was full of drones!
It's crazy!

1453
01:39:32,338 --> 01:39:33,488
There you are.

1454
01:39:37,646 --> 01:39:38,646
Easy...

1455
01:39:42,301 --> 01:39:43,864
Who the hell is that?

1456
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:46,420
- Ned!
- Happy!

1457
01:39:46,764 --> 01:39:48,911
I gotta get you guys outta here!
Get on the jet!

1458
01:39:48,936 --> 01:39:50,905
- Who are you?
- I work with Spider-Man, okay?

1459
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:52,820
- You gotta get on that jet.
- You work for Spider-Man?

1460
01:39:52,845 --> 01:39:55,180
I work with Spider-Man,
not for Spider-Man!

1461
01:39:58,350 --> 01:40:00,211
New plan. Into the tower!

1462
01:40:00,765 --> 01:40:03,625
- Happy, are you okay?
- Yeah, we're okay. Just go get Beck.

1463
01:40:03,695 --> 01:40:06,123
- EDITH, target Spider-Man.
- Copy.

1464
01:40:10,806 --> 01:40:12,556
I'll just kill the kids myself.

1465
01:40:27,208 --> 01:40:28,771
There you are.

1466
01:40:31,153 --> 01:40:34,193
Into the crown jewels vault!
Go, go, go!

1467
01:40:38,535 --> 01:40:40,973
Go into the vault. The walls
are eight feet thick.

1468
01:40:40,998 --> 01:40:42,567
- Go into the vault!
- What?

1469
01:40:42,592 --> 01:40:44,263
Into the vault! Go!

1470
01:40:46,325 --> 01:40:47,661
Take cover!

1471
01:41:19,467 --> 01:41:20,982
I see you.

1472
01:41:29,374 --> 01:41:30,459
Go!

1473
01:41:37,515 --> 01:41:39,264
How does Cap do that?

1474
01:41:48,902 --> 01:41:52,089
Happy? Say something, please.
Just let me know you're alive.

1475
01:41:52,114 --> 01:41:54,629
- I'm here! I'm here.
- Oh, Happy! Thank God.

1476
01:41:54,668 --> 01:41:56,253
I bought us some time.

1477
01:41:57,496 --> 01:41:58,395
But not much.

1478
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:01,395
I'm trying to get to Beck but
I can't shake these drones.

1479
01:42:15,738 --> 01:42:16,862
Gotcha.

1480
01:42:39,066 --> 01:42:40,442
Goin' up!

1481
01:43:17,387 --> 01:43:18,488
Finally.

1482
01:43:18,582 --> 01:43:20,201
Hey, William?
How are we doing?

1483
01:43:20,226 --> 01:43:22,310
Illusion almost back up.

1484
01:43:22,755 --> 01:43:24,903
I don't know how you're
gonna spin this.

1485
01:43:39,579 --> 01:43:41,602
Great. No webs.

1486
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:55,618
Are we gonna die?

1487
01:43:55,643 --> 01:43:57,384
Nobody dies on my watch.

1488
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:02,438
I wasted my life playing video
games and we're gonna die!

1489
01:44:03,322 --> 01:44:06,485
I have a fake ID. And
I've never even used it.

1490
01:44:07,136 --> 01:44:09,792
I post stupid videos daily
for people to like me!

1491
01:44:09,817 --> 01:44:14,370
Hey! If it wasn't for those stupid videos,
Spider-Man would have never found you.

1492
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:17,108
Spider-Man follows me?

1493
01:44:17,327 --> 01:44:18,389
I saved us, guys!

1494
01:44:18,414 --> 01:44:20,405
If you saved us, then why
are we about to die?

1495
01:44:20,585 --> 01:44:23,186
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry! Okay?

1496
01:44:23,211 --> 01:44:26,820
I just... I'm obsessed with telling the truth
even if it hurts other people's feelings.

1497
01:44:27,726 --> 01:44:29,889
I'm in love with
Spider-Man's aunt.

1498
01:44:33,903 --> 01:44:35,322
We're sharing, right?

1499
01:45:14,307 --> 01:45:15,768
Your lies are over, Beck.

1500
01:45:16,963 --> 01:45:21,502
This certainly isn't ideal, but...
I have contingencies. EDITH?

1501
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:31,284
Just give me the glasses.

1502
01:45:32,347 --> 01:45:33,722
You want these?

1503
01:45:35,634 --> 01:45:36,986
Come and get them.

1504
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:48,213
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1505
01:46:12,916 --> 01:46:14,376
Why aren't these
drones firing?

1506
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:16,197
You're in the strike zone.
The chance of getting hit...

1507
01:46:16,222 --> 01:46:19,925
No, fire all the drones now!

1508
01:46:38,837 --> 01:46:39,837
Beck!

1509
01:46:43,993 --> 01:46:44,993
Beck...

1510
01:46:45,766 --> 01:46:47,101
You lied to me.

1511
01:46:47,972 --> 01:46:50,532
- I trusted you.
- I know.

1512
01:46:50,557 --> 01:46:54,620
That's the most...
disappointing part.

1513
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,939
You're a good person, Peter.

1514
01:47:00,186 --> 01:47:01,993
Such a weakness...

1515
01:47:04,013 --> 01:47:05,833
Stark was right.

1516
01:47:06,365 --> 01:47:08,013
You do deserve them.

1517
01:47:19,626 --> 01:47:21,596
You can't trick me anymore.

1518
01:47:25,205 --> 01:47:27,173
EDITH, turn off the drones!

1519
01:47:27,869 --> 01:47:31,072
Biometric scan complete.
Welcome back, Peter.

1520
01:47:31,189 --> 01:47:33,306
Shall I execute all
cancellation protocols?

1521
01:47:33,331 --> 01:47:35,151
Do it. Execute them all.

1522
01:47:35,176 --> 01:47:36,526
Confirmed.

1523
01:47:45,054 --> 01:47:46,546
Give me the spear.

1524
01:47:47,435 --> 01:47:48,882
That's a halberd.

1525
01:47:53,936 --> 01:47:55,037
Thank you.

1526
01:47:59,009 --> 01:48:01,006
How could you do all of this?

1527
01:48:01,548 --> 01:48:02,985
You'll see, Peter.

1528
01:48:04,048 --> 01:48:07,376
People tend to believe...

1529
01:48:08,626 --> 01:48:10,376
And nowadays...

1530
01:48:12,395 --> 01:48:14,507
they'll believe anything.

1531
01:48:25,286 --> 01:48:26,464
Is he...

1532
01:48:27,666 --> 01:48:28,939
Is this real?

1533
01:48:30,404 --> 01:48:32,595
All illusions are down, Peter.

1534
01:48:49,002 --> 01:48:50,502
Where are you going?

1535
01:48:58,494 --> 01:48:59,494
MJ.

1536
01:49:01,559 --> 01:49:03,348
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Are you okay?

1537
01:49:03,364 --> 01:49:06,012
- Yeah.
- Is everybody also okay?

1538
01:49:06,037 --> 01:49:07,497
Everyone's okay.

1539
01:49:08,991 --> 01:49:09,968
What happened?

1540
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,562
There was this... the drones, and they were
following us, and then, they just stopped.

1541
01:49:16,001 --> 01:49:17,587
- Was that you?
- Yeah.

1542
01:49:18,757 --> 01:49:20,155
Did you get him?

1543
01:49:23,210 --> 01:49:25,444
- Yeah.
- Well, I, umm...

1544
01:49:26,128 --> 01:49:27,635
brought that.

1545
01:49:28,362 --> 01:49:31,432
- In case you needed some help.
- Thanks.

1546
01:49:33,764 --> 01:49:35,693
Anyway, uh...

1547
01:49:35,865 --> 01:49:38,308
There was this sweaty guy,
in the tower with us.

1548
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:40,748
I think, he like, works
for you or something.

1549
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:42,060
He, um...

1550
01:49:42,357 --> 01:49:43,662
He gave me this.

1551
01:49:43,748 --> 01:49:44,748
No...

1552
01:49:45,256 --> 01:49:46,256
No!

1553
01:49:47,625 --> 01:49:50,880
Oh, MJ, I am so sorry. I had
this plan, this stupid plan,

1554
01:49:50,905 --> 01:49:52,436
and I wrote it all down,
and I was gonna buy you

1555
01:49:52,461 --> 01:49:54,545
this. I'll give it to you
in Paris, at the top...

1556
01:49:58,834 --> 01:50:00,107
Did you kiss me?

1557
01:50:02,826 --> 01:50:07,107
I don't really have much luck when
it comes to getting close to people...

1558
01:50:09,294 --> 01:50:10,669
so I lied.

1559
01:50:12,329 --> 01:50:16,596
I wasn't just watching you 'cause
I thought you were Spider-Man.

1560
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:22,375
That's great.

1561
01:50:23,688 --> 01:50:25,441
Black Dahlia. Like...

1562
01:50:25,466 --> 01:50:27,696
- The murder. Yeah.
- The murder. Yeah.

1563
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:30,039
I'm sorry it's broken.

1564
01:50:30,508 --> 01:50:32,547
I actually like it better broken.

1565
01:50:34,298 --> 01:50:35,758
I really like you.

1566
01:50:37,192 --> 01:50:38,725
I really like you, too.

1567
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,605
Okay. I should, umm...

1568
01:50:54,668 --> 01:50:57,730
I should walk... probably
get back to the class.

1569
01:50:57,762 --> 01:50:59,137
I'll go and...

1570
01:51:00,309 --> 01:51:02,012
yeah. I don't know.

1571
01:51:03,902 --> 01:51:05,246
Just in case.

1572
01:51:13,194 --> 01:51:17,952
Yeah. No, no, May, you're right.
He did great. He was strong.

1573
01:51:18,093 --> 01:51:21,608
Yeah. I'm glad he stayed, too.
I gotta go.

1574
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:26,078
Well, I'm glad you're alive. I
guess the coded message worked.

1575
01:51:26,103 --> 01:51:28,877
"Appearances can be deceiving."

1576
01:51:28,902 --> 01:51:31,253
I'm surprised you didn't
just wink in the camera.

1577
01:51:31,348 --> 01:51:32,386
It worked.

1578
01:51:32,411 --> 01:51:35,284
Only because I had serious doubts
about Beck from the beginning.

1579
01:51:35,309 --> 01:51:37,242
Not true. He had zero doubts.

1580
01:51:40,463 --> 01:51:41,869
Where's Parker?

1581
01:51:42,118 --> 01:51:45,451
- He's with the girl.
- I need to speak with him.

1582
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:47,437
He'll call you.

1583
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:48,625
He'll ca...

1584
01:51:52,375 --> 01:51:54,968
Okay! Great!

1585
01:51:54,993 --> 01:51:58,226
Well he better.
Or it's your ass.

1586
01:51:59,188 --> 01:52:02,305
And don't even think
about ghosting me.

1587
01:52:19,316 --> 01:52:21,300
You sure no one else
has figured it out?

1588
01:52:21,325 --> 01:52:24,660
Yeah. It's not like anybody
really pays attention to you.

1589
01:52:25,339 --> 01:52:26,387
Ouch.

1590
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:27,980
Except for me.

1591
01:52:28,394 --> 01:52:30,487
- Aww. Thanks.
- Don't be late.

1592
01:52:30,512 --> 01:52:32,184
I won't. See you later.

1593
01:52:32,209 --> 01:52:34,996
- You guys are so cute.
- Thanks.

1594
01:52:36,404 --> 01:52:38,238
I was thinking that
maybe we should all...

1595
01:52:38,472 --> 01:52:40,416
I don't know, like go on a
double date or something.

1596
01:52:40,441 --> 01:52:42,812
- Oh... we broke up.
- Oh... we broke up.

1597
01:52:42,837 --> 01:52:44,471
No! What... why?

1598
01:52:44,496 --> 01:52:47,381
Men and women grow apart.
But the journey they

1599
01:52:47,406 --> 01:52:50,362
shared together will
always be a part of them.

1600
01:52:51,602 --> 01:52:54,172
- You are so wise.
- Thank you.

1601
01:52:56,860 --> 01:52:58,055
Hello, Gerald.

1602
01:52:59,264 --> 01:53:01,108
Could Mother not make it?

1603
01:53:07,253 --> 01:53:07,839
May!

1604
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:10,495
I promise you... He's here!
Don't give me a ticket.

1605
01:53:13,058 --> 01:53:14,870
So glad you're okay!

1606
01:53:15,303 --> 01:53:18,339
No. For real, I'm good. I'm
actually really... fine.

1607
01:53:18,364 --> 01:53:20,308
Let's go. Where
are your bags?

1608
01:53:20,333 --> 01:53:22,387
- Oh, right. They got blown up.
- Yeah.

1609
01:53:26,824 --> 01:53:29,989
I've kept my identity pretty
guarded, these past couple of years.

1610
01:53:30,101 --> 01:53:34,543
I faced a lot of deception,
and I'm tired of the lies.

1611
01:53:34,686 --> 01:53:37,240
So, it's time for the
truth to be out there.

1612
01:53:40,341 --> 01:53:42,093
Are you dating?

1613
01:53:42,483 --> 01:53:43,647
- Not really.
- Yes.

1614
01:53:44,851 --> 01:53:45,952
What?

1615
01:53:46,671 --> 01:53:48,624
- I... think...
- summer fling.

1616
01:53:48,679 --> 01:53:50,585
Yes, that evolves
and grows like...

1617
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:51,901
I still don't know where
it's going to go.

1618
01:53:51,913 --> 01:53:54,342
- Opens you wherever it might lead.
- Anywhere.

1619
01:53:54,367 --> 01:53:55,594
And to share with people...

1620
01:53:55,619 --> 01:53:57,844
But we'll always be
friends no matter what.

1621
01:53:57,875 --> 01:54:01,008
I'm gonna go, because
I've got a date... Uh...

1622
01:54:01,561 --> 01:54:02,561
We all are interconnected...

1623
01:54:02,586 --> 01:54:03,586
Bye!

1624
01:55:00,437 --> 01:55:00,938
- Hey!
- Hey!

1625
01:55:00,969 --> 01:55:02,234
Sorry I'm late.

1626
01:55:02,432 --> 01:55:03,422
It's fine.

1627
01:55:03,469 --> 01:55:05,053
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1628
01:55:05,078 --> 01:55:06,453
You're gonna love this.

1629
01:55:06,691 --> 01:55:09,224
Okay! Okay! Okay!

1630
01:55:10,335 --> 01:55:12,950
I'm not gonna watch.
I'm not gonna watch.

1631
01:55:15,467 --> 01:55:19,303
I'm not looking.
I'm not looking!

1632
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:36,175
Subbed by:
FujiFilm69 (iamdepressd69)

1633
01:57:35,293 --> 01:57:37,957
You can put me down now!
You can put me down now!

1634
01:57:39,835 --> 01:57:40,921
You okay?

1635
01:57:44,892 --> 01:57:47,720
Yeah! Yeah, I'm okay. Just...

1636
01:57:47,962 --> 01:57:50,931
Never, never doing that again.
I'm never doing that again.

1637
01:57:50,955 --> 01:57:53,399
Okay. Well, I should
probably get out of here.

1638
01:57:53,424 --> 01:57:55,454
- Be safe.
- See you later.

1639
01:57:58,101 --> 01:58:00,116
This is breaking news.

1640
01:58:00,249 --> 01:58:02,952
We come to you now with revelations
about last week's attack in London.

1641
01:58:02,976 --> 01:58:05,796
An anonymous source provided
this video, it shows

1642
01:58:05,821 --> 01:58:09,952
Quentin Beck, aka, Mysterio,
moments before his death.

1643
01:58:09,992 --> 01:58:12,632
A warning: You may find
this video disturbing.

1644
01:58:12,695 --> 01:58:14,510
I managed to send the Elemental
back into the dimensional rift

1645
01:58:14,535 --> 01:58:16,554
but I don't think I'm gonna
make it off this bridge alive.

1646
01:58:16,585 --> 01:58:18,506
Spider-Man attacked me
for some reason. He has

1647
01:58:18,531 --> 01:58:20,811
an army of weaponized
drones, Stark technology.

1648
01:58:20,836 --> 01:58:24,502
He's saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.

1649
01:58:24,627 --> 01:58:26,408
Are you sure you want
to commence the drone

1650
01:58:26,433 --> 01:58:28,728
attack? There will be
significant casualities.

1651
01:58:28,921 --> 01:58:31,259
Do it. Execute them all.

1652
01:58:35,258 --> 01:58:38,207
This shocking video was
released earlier today on

1653
01:58:38,232 --> 01:58:41,214
the controversial news
website 'thedailybugle.net.'

1654
01:58:41,239 --> 01:58:44,520
There you have it folks:
conclusive proof that Spider-Man

1655
01:58:44,545 --> 01:58:47,567
was responsible for the
brutal murder of Mysterio!

1656
01:58:47,598 --> 01:58:51,724
An interdimensional warrior who gave his
life to protect our planet, and who

1657
01:58:51,749 --> 01:58:57,202
will no doubt, go down in history as
the greatest superhero of all time!

1658
01:58:57,609 --> 01:59:00,905
But that's not all folks,
here's the real blockbuster.

1659
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:02,466
Brace yourselves, you
might wanna sit down.

1660
01:59:02,491 --> 01:59:05,046
Spider-Man's real...
Spider-Man's real name is...

1661
01:59:07,864 --> 01:59:10,965
Spider-Man's name
is Peter Parker!

1662
01:59:11,887 --> 01:59:12,919
What the fu...
