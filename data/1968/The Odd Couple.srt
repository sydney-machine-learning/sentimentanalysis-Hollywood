1
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,071
–Room, please?
–You alone?

2
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,168
Luggage?

3
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:47,833
–How long you want it for?
–Not very long.

4
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:51,594
$ 5.

5
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,805
$ 5.

6
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,269
307.

7
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,186
Haven't you anything higher?

8
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,561
Higher?

9
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:19,993
914?

10
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,955
Good night.

11
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,951
Goodbye.

12
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:18,216
Oh, no. Oh, no.

13
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,585
–Ante.
–Ante up.

14
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:46,558
Aren't you the one they call
the Cincinnati Kid?

15
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,719
You don't like it? Get a machine.

16
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:51,307
–It stinks in here.
–What time is it?

17
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:54,140
–Again?
–My watch is slow.

18
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:57,561
You're winning $ 95. That's what time.
Where are you running?

19
00:09:57,603 --> 00:10:01,055
–Nowhere. I just asked the time.
–It's 10:30.

20
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:06,899
I gotta leave by 12:00.
I told you when I sat down.

21
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:10,405
Murray, didn't I say
I got leave by 12:00?

22
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:13,066
Don't talk to him, he's dealing.

23
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:18,041
Want a rest for a while?
Go lie down, sweetheart.

24
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,701
You want speed or accuracy?
Make up your mind.

25
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:28,002
You wanna do me a really big favour?
Smoke towards New Jersey.

26
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:34,892
I'm really worried about Felix.
He's never been this late.

27
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:39,679
Maybe somebody should call.
Oscar. Why don't you call Felix?

28
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:43,943
Why don't we chip in and buy
another window? You can't breathe.

29
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:46,939
How many cards you got? Four?

30
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:51,360
We all have four cards.
Give us one more and we'll have five.

31
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:55,034
Two more, we'll have six.
Understand how it works?

32
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,114
Is Oscar playing or not?

33
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,995
–Hey, Oscar!
–Yeah?

34
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:04,831
–You in or out?
–Out, pussycat, out.

35
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:08,177
I told my wife I'd be home
by 1:00 at the latest.

36
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:11,255
We're on an eight o'clock
plane to Florida.

37
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,052
Who goes to Florida in July?

38
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:16,894
It's off season. There's no crowds.

39
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:19,898
The best room is one-tenth
the price. No cards.

40
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:22,650
Some vacation.
Six people in an empty hotel.

41
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:27,603
Dealer takes four.
You think maybe Felix is sick?

42
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:30,534
I mean he's never been this late before.

43
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,288
This is the same garbage from last week.
I'm recognising things.

44
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:35,574
I'm out.

45
00:11:35,747 --> 00:11:37,787
–Two kings.
–Straight.

46
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,468
Maybe he's in his office,
locked in the john again.

47
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:45,257
Did you know Felix was once locked
in the john overnight?

48
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:50,341
He wrote his entire will
on half a roll of toilet paper. What a nut!

49
00:11:50,513 --> 00:11:53,816
Don't play with your chips.
I'm asking you nice.

50
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,852
I'm not playing. I'm counting.
Leave me alone.

51
00:11:55,893 --> 00:12:00,141
I can't stand a guy who's winning
who plays with his chips.

52
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:03,902
This is my house. You wanna play
with your chips, you play with them.

53
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:05,438
I'm in for a quarter.

54
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:07,739
Aren't you gonna look
at your cards first?

55
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:11,565
I'm gonna bluff anyway.
Who gets the Pepsi?

56
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:14,565
Murray, the policeman,
gets a warm Pepsi.

57
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,876
You didn't fix the refrigerator?
It's been two weeks. No wonder it stinks.

58
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:22,634
Temper. If I wanted nagging,
I'd go back with my wife.

59
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:25,626
–I'm out. Who wants food?
–What you got?

60
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,383
Brown sandwiches
and green sandwiches.

61
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:32,638
–Which one do you want?
–What's the green?

62
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:35,518
It's either very new cheese
or very old meat.

63
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,840
I'll take brown.

64
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,471
–You're not gonna eat that?
–I'm hungry.

65
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:45,696
His refrigerator's out of order. I saw milk
standing that wasn't even in a bottle!

66
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:48,240
Are you some kind of health nut?
Eat, Murray.

67
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:51,410
–I got six cards.
–That figures. I got three aces.

68
00:12:51,452 --> 00:12:53,278
–Misdeal.
–Peanuts?

69
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:55,381
Felix makes good sandwiches.

70
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:58,876
Did you taste his cream cheese
and pimento on date nut bread?

71
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:02,168
Make up your mind,
poker or recipes.

72
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:05,090
You've got beer all over my glasses!

73
00:13:05,258 --> 00:13:06,918
You got it on the chips.

74
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:09,584
It's all over me now!

75
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:13,968
What is this?

76
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:18,647
Don't put it in the middle of the table.

77
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:26,481
How can you play like this?

78
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,281
Let's play some poker here.

79
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:32,360
Who's playing here?

80
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:34,705
Vinnie, tell Oscar
what time you're leaving.

81
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,909
Twelve o'clock.

82
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:40,378
We got ten minutes before the next
announcement. This is five card stud.

83
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,626
Five card stud.

84
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:47,210
A red lady, a deuce, quatro,
a big ace for the policeman.

85
00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:50,968
Wait, the pot's shy.
Who didn't put in a quarter?

86
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:54,590
–You didn't.
–You got a big mouth. Lend me $ 20.

87
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:57,229
I just loaned you $ 20.
Ask somebody else.

88
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,335
I'm winning my own money back.

89
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,150
You owe everybody.
If you don't have it, don't play.

90
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:06,447
I'm through being the nice guy.
You owe me $ 6 apiece for the buffet.

91
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:07,983
What buffet?

92
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:11,368
Hot beer and two sandwiches left
from when you went to high school.

93
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,888
What do you want?
A tomato surprise?

94
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:18,459
Lend me $ 20 or I'll tell your wife
you're in Central Park wearing a dress.

95
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:20,292
Maybe that's Felix.

96
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,695
–Pair o' sixes.
–Three deuces.

97
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:27,218
Why didn't you go to Florida last night?

98
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,912
Oscar, the Poker player.

99
00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:31,806
If that's my wife,
tell her I'm leaving at 12:00.

100
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:35,143
Look at your watch once more,
you get peanuts in your face. Deal.

101
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:36,465
Talk up. Who?

102
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:44,602
Oh, Daddy.
For crying out loud, it's my kid.

103
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:47,269
Brucey, how are you, baby?

104
00:14:47,448 --> 00:14:52,489
No, I couldn't. There's a lot
of boys here. We're playing.

105
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:56,280
Boys, fellas.
Give me a break, will you?

106
00:14:56,457 --> 00:15:00,503
My kid is calling from California.
It must be costing a fortune.

107
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:04,625
How have you been, honey?
Yes, I got your letter.

108
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,088
Yes, it took three weeks.

109
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,760
Next time
tell Mommy to give you a stamp.

110
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:14,991
Yeah, I know, Honey,
but you're not supposed to draw it on.

111
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:19,387
–Hey, you hear this?
–We hear. We're all thrilled.

112
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:23,894
Mommy wants to talk to me?
All right, sweetheart.

113
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:26,276
I love you, soldier. Goodbye.

114
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:27,727
Ante a dollar.

115
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:32,724
–You got a dollar to play, Oscar?
–Not after I've talked to this lady.

116
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:34,868
Hello, Blanche, how are you?

117
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,252
Yeah, you're calling because
I'm a week behind with the cheque, right?

118
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:41,358
Four weeks? It's not possible.

119
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:45,502
I keep a record of every cheque
in my files here

120
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:49,048
and I happen to know
I'm only three weeks behind.

121
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,852
Don't threaten me with jail, Blanche,
because it's not a threat.

122
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:59,436
With my expenses and my alimony,
a prisoner gets more pay than me.

123
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,643
Very nice language
in front of the children.

124
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,032
I'm $ 800 behind in alimony!
Let's raise the stakes.

125
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:11,033
She can do it, you know?
Throw you in jail.

126
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:14,161
If she can't aggravate me,
she's not happy.

127
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,499
Aren't you worried about the kids?

128
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:20,170
They live in their grandfather's house
in California. Can we play?

129
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:23,215
I said you'd get into trouble.
You can't manage anything.

130
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:26,468
–I know. I'm your accountant.
–Then why do I need money?

131
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,125
–Why do you play poker?
–I need money.

132
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:31,932
–You always lose.
–That's why I need the money.

133
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:35,509
–Then don't play.
–Then don't eat my potato chips.

134
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:37,513
Beautiful, beautiful.

135
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:41,108
What are you yelling about?
This is a friendly game.

136
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,110
We've been sitting here
talking since eight o'clock.

137
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:45,446
Since 7:00.
That's why I said I'd quit at 12:00.

138
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:48,241
How would you like a stale banana
right in the mouth?

139
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:51,983
Calm down. Take it easy.

140
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:55,531
I'm a cop, I could arrest
the whole lousy game.

141
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,876
Murray is right.

142
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:04,091
Let's play cards and hold them up.
I can't see where I marked them.

143
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:07,719
He owes money to his wife,
government, friends and still isn't serious.

144
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:11,640
Life goes on for those
who are divorced, broke and sloppy.

145
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:14,683
Hello, Divorced, Broke and Sloppy.

146
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:18,601
Hello, sweetheart. Yes, darling.

147
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:36,825
You know I do, darling.
Yeah? Hold on, just a second.

148
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,456
Murray, it's your wife.

149
00:17:41,713 --> 00:17:45,551
If you were having an affair with her,
she wouldn't bother me all the time.

150
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:46,921
Hello, Mimi.

151
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:49,805
When are you coming home?
About 12:00,12:30.

152
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:53,547
About 12:00,12:30.
What do you want?

153
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:56,479
A corned beef sandwich
and a strawberry malted?

154
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,020
–Is she pregnant again?
–No, just fat.

155
00:18:00,191 --> 00:18:04,023
How could you hear?
I had the phone over my chest.

156
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:06,900
Felix? No, he didn't show up tonight.

157
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:12,697
What's wrong? You're kidding?
How should I know?

158
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,908
All right, Mimi.
I'll take care of it. Goodbye.

159
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:23,172
–Felix is missing.
–What do you mean?

160
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,844
He didn't show up for work.
Nobody knows where he is.

161
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:30,835
–Mimi spoke to his wife.
–No one is missing for one day.

162
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:35,603
Maybe he had an accident. If he's laying
in a gutter, who'd know who he is?

163
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:38,231
He's got 92 credit cards in his wallet.

164
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:43,434
The minute something happens to him,
America lights up. I'll call his wife.

165
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:47,776
I thought he looked edgy
the last few weeks, didn't you?

166
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:50,156
No. I thought you looked edgy.

167
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:55,285
Frances, how are you?
Oscar. Yeah, I just heard.

168
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:58,460
Tell her not to worry.
She's probably hysterical.

169
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:01,380
Frances, the most important thing
is not to worry.

170
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:03,130
She's not worried.

171
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,983
Do you have any idea where he could be?

172
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:09,721
He what? You're kidding?

173
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:18,804
I didn't know. He never told me.
Yeah, all right.

174
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:22,900
Listen, Frances, you just sit tight.

175
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:27,061
The minute I hear anything
I'll let you know. OK, goodbye.

176
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:45,254
You gonna tell us
or do we hire a private detective?

177
00:19:49,138 --> 00:19:51,890
–They broke up.
–Who?

178
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,183
Who? Felix and Frances is “who”.
They broke up.

179
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:59,607
–The entire marriage is through.
–You're kidding!

180
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:01,523
After 12 years?

181
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:03,758
They were such a happy couple.

182
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:07,991
He'll go to pieces. I know Felix.
He'll try something crazy.

183
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:10,619
All he talked about
was his wife and kids.

184
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:13,152
He'll kill himself.
You hear?

185
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,221
Shut up.
Stop being a cop for two minutes.

186
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,461
–Where did he go?
–He went out to kill himself.

187
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:22,187
–What did I tell you?
–Are you serious?

188
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:25,676
She said he didn't want to do it at home
because the kids were sleeping.

189
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:28,838
–Why?
–He's a nut, that's why.

190
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:31,800
But did he say it in those words?

191
00:20:31,975 --> 00:20:34,659
I don't know.
She didn't read it to me.

192
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:37,722
–He left her a note?
–He sent a telegram.

193
00:20:37,897 --> 00:20:40,942
–Who sends a suicide telegram?
–Felix, the nut.

194
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:45,113
Can you imagine that?
She even has to tip the kid a quarter.

195
00:20:51,995 --> 00:20:53,573
Ah!

196
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,295
Maybe he's just bluffing.
We get these cases every day.

197
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:01,745
All they want is a little sympathy.

198
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:07,845
You never can tell what
a guy will do when he's hysterical.

199
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:10,056
Nine times out of ten, they don't jump.

200
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:13,476
–And the tenth time?
–He's right. There's a possibility.

201
00:21:13,518 --> 00:21:16,753
I know Felix.
He's too nervous to kill himself.

202
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:20,188
He wears his seat belt
in drive-in movies.

203
00:21:22,444 --> 00:21:27,106
If you're gonna kill yourself,
where's the safest place to do it?

204
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:29,451
With your friends.
Vinnie, open the door.

205
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:32,746
He may be hysterical.
If we're calm, he'll be calm.

206
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:35,541
That's what they do.
They talk nice and soft.

207
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,294
–What do we say?
–Nothing, like we never heard a thing.

208
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:42,173
Are you through? He already
could've hung himself in the hall.

209
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:46,082
–Vinnie, open the door.
–Remember, like we know nothing.

210
00:21:51,474 --> 00:21:53,597
–Oh hi, Felix.
–Hi.

211
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:04,861
Hey, fellas.

212
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,023
–Hi.
–Hi, Felix.

213
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,206
–How's the game going?
–Good.

214
00:22:18,377 --> 00:22:20,454
–Very nice.
–Good.

215
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,132
I'm sorry, I'm late.

216
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,917
Is there any… ginger ale left?

217
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,467
Ginger ale? I don't think so.
I got some root beer.

218
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,886
Nope. I felt like a ginger ale.

219
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,927
Somehow I don't feel like a root beer…

220
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,731
…tonight.

221
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,568
What's the bet?

222
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:28,630
You bet a quarter. It's up to Murray.
Murray, what do you say?

223
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,955
–Murray… Murray?
–Tap his shoulder.

224
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:35,748
–What?
–It's up to you.

225
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:38,503
–Why is it always up to me?
–It's up to you now.

226
00:23:38,545 --> 00:23:41,083
–What do you do?
–I'm in, I'm in.

227
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:43,747
Anybody call about me?

228
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:47,970
Call… about you?
No, not that I can remember.

229
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:53,267
Were you expecting…
Did anyone call for Felix?

230
00:23:53,435 --> 00:23:54,680
No.

231
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:59,562
–Were you expecting a call?
–No, I was just asking.

232
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:01,726
I raise a dollar.

233
00:24:01,902 --> 00:24:05,106
Costs me a dollar
and a quarter, right?

234
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:08,614
I just thought that somebody
might have called.

235
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:13,700
If nobody called, nobody called.

236
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:20,171
–What does it cost to play again?
–A dollar and a quarter. Pay attention.

237
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:23,341
–All right, take it easy.
–Calm down, everyone.

238
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:25,929
I can't help it.
He makes me nervous.

239
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:29,389
–You make everybody nervous.
–I'm sorry. I'll kill myself.

240
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:32,053
–Murray!
–I'm sorry.

241
00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:39,274
That's a pretty view from here.
What is it, 12 floors?

242
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:42,727
No, it's only 11 floors, that's all.

243
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:48,989
See, it's only 11 floors.
It says 12 but it's really only 11.

244
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:53,696
Gee, it's chilly in here.

245
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:59,984
–Isn't it chilly in here?
–Yes it is, very chilly.

246
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,800
–Want to play Felix? It's still early.
–We're in no rush.

247
00:25:03,842 --> 00:25:07,128
We'll be here
till 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning.

248
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:13,510
I don't know. I just don't feel
much like playing right now.

249
00:25:18,357 --> 00:25:20,895
What do you feel like doing?

250
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:26,647
I don't know.
I'll think of something.

251
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:34,826
–Where are you going?
–To the john.

252
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,872
–Alone?
–I always go alone. Why?

253
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:45,092
No reason.
You gonna be in there long?

254
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,255
Long as it takes.

255
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:01,068
Are you crazy,
letting him go alone?

256
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,238
–Suppose he tries to kill himself?
–In the john?

257
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,449
Razor blades, poison,
anything that's in there.

258
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:09,244
That's the kid's bathroom. The worst
he could do is brush his teeth to death.

259
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:10,744
He could jump.

260
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:13,623
–Isn't there a window in there?
–It's only six inches wide.

261
00:26:13,665 --> 00:26:15,584
He could break the glass,
and cut his wrists.

262
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,241
And flush himself into the East River.

263
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,707
–He won't try anything.
–Listen.

264
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:28,837
He's crying.

265
00:26:29,014 --> 00:26:31,506
You hear that, he's crying.

266
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:37,648
Isn't that terrible? For God's sakes,
Oscar, say something.

267
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,735
What do you say to a man
who's crying in your bathroom?

268
00:26:40,777 --> 00:26:42,686
He's coming!

269
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:14,723
Well, I guess I'll just be running along…

270
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,887
Felix, wait a second!

271
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:21,731
No, I can't talk to you.
I can't talk to anyone.

272
00:27:21,903 --> 00:27:25,983
Felix, we're your friends.
Don't run out like this.

273
00:27:26,157 --> 00:27:30,704
There's nothing to talk about it.
There's nothing to say. It's over.

274
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:34,494
–Let me go. Please, leave me alone.
–Let him go.

275
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,375
Stop him!

276
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:53,302
–Let's go. Break the door down.
–Break it in.

277
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:58,023
Felix! He's jumped.
I tell you he jumped.

278
00:27:58,191 --> 00:27:59,566
My back!

279
00:28:01,194 --> 00:28:03,946
My back! My back!

280
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:08,653
My back! My back!

281
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:24,797
Will you leave me alone?
Oh, my stomach!

282
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,013
What's the matter with your stomach?

283
00:28:27,054 --> 00:28:29,640
Nothing. I didn't take anything.
Leave me alone.

284
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:32,387
–What did you take?
–Nothing.

285
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,562
Don't tell Frances what I did.

286
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:36,731
–He took pills!
–What kind of pills?

287
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:40,076
I don't know. Little green ones.
Don't call her.

288
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,612
Felix, when did you take these pills?

289
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,407
A couple of hours ago.
You won't call her.

290
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:49,661
–How many pills did you take?
–I can't remember. A whole bottle and…

291
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:52,915
A whole bottle of pills!
My God! Get an ambulance.

292
00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:56,210
–We don't know what kind.
–What difference does it make?

293
00:28:56,252 --> 00:28:58,421
–He took a whole bottle.
–Maybe they were vitamins.

294
00:28:58,462 --> 00:29:00,756
He could be the healthiest one here.

295
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,752
Walk him around. Don't let him sleep.

296
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:06,500
Open the window,
give him some air!

297
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,716
Rub his wrists.
Keep his circulation going.

298
00:29:09,891 --> 00:29:13,353
One doctor at a time.
All the interns, shut the hell up!

299
00:29:13,394 --> 00:29:15,055
You didn't call Frances?

300
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,692
–Get him under the cold shower.
–Vinnie, turn the shower on.

301
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:21,141
Watch my arm.

302
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:23,817
Please. Turn it off!

303
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:26,065
We gotta get the pills out.

304
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,947
The pills are out. I threw up before.

305
00:29:38,754 --> 00:29:41,424
12 years.

306
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:45,042
Did you know I was married
12 years, Roy?

307
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:46,548
Yes, Felix. I knew.

308
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:49,182
It's over like that. That's hysterical.

309
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:52,727
Maybe it was just a fight.
You've had fights before, Felix.

310
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:57,311
No, it's over. She's getting
a lawyer tomorrow –my cousin, she is.

311
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:02,731
–Who am I gonna get?
–It's OK, Felix.

312
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:09,879
All right, let's not stand around
looking at him. Let's break it up.

313
00:30:09,912 --> 00:30:13,040
Don't stand there looking at me.
I'm ashamed of it.

314
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:15,288
Let's call it a night.

315
00:30:22,425 --> 00:30:26,830
–It's all right. We understand.
–Don't tell anybody. Promise me.

316
00:30:26,971 --> 00:30:30,809
–I'm going to Florida tomorrow.
–That's nice. Have a good time.

317
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,854
We were going to Florida
next winter without the kids.

318
00:30:33,895 --> 00:30:36,137
Now they're going without me.

319
00:30:37,316 --> 00:30:39,771
OK, come on, boys.

320
00:30:39,943 --> 00:30:41,486
Good night.

321
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:43,822
–One of us should stay.
–It's OK.

322
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:46,033
Suppose he tries something again.

323
00:30:46,075 --> 00:30:48,482
–He won't.
–How do you know?

324
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:51,828
I won't try anything.
I'm very tired.

325
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:56,746
You hear? He's very tired,
he's had a busy night. Good night, fellas.

326
00:30:56,878 --> 00:30:58,336
Good night.

327
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:10,472
If anything happens, Oscar, just call me.

328
00:31:10,642 --> 00:31:14,427
I'm three blocks away.
I could be here in five minutes.

329
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:18,934
If you need me, I'll be
at the Meridian Motel, Miami Beach.

330
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:22,728
–You'll be the first one I call, Vinnie.
–Good.

331
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:27,609
–Oscar.
–Yeah?

332
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,657
–Are you sure?
–I'm sure.

333
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:34,167
Good night, Felix.
Get a good night's sleep.

334
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:37,030
Things will look brighter in the morning.

335
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,957
Take away his belt and his shoelaces.

336
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:50,136
Felix, Felix…

337
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,927
–Felix, Felix.
–I know. I know!

338
00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:58,565
I know!

339
00:32:01,195 --> 00:32:04,979
Oscar, what am I gonna do?

340
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:09,704
We'll talk about it later.
Get something to eat first.

341
00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:11,914
Would you like some hot Ovaltine?

342
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:14,876
The thing is I still love her.
I always loved her.

343
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:19,165
How about vanilla wafers
or Vienna fingers, or Mallomars?

344
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:22,634
A nice box of chocolate Mallomars?
I got everything.

345
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:26,680
We had so much together.
Two beautiful kids, a beautiful home.

346
00:32:26,722 --> 00:32:30,766
Whoever had more beautiful kids
or a more beautiful home?

347
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:33,103
12 years of marriage
down the drain.

348
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:37,233
Drains can be fixed. We have plumbers.
Get me a pot under the sink.

349
00:32:37,274 --> 00:32:40,275
It's not fair. Dammit, it's not fair…

350
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:45,739
–What's the matter?
–I got a nerve spasm in my neck.

351
00:32:45,908 --> 00:32:49,324
Just take it easy.
Show me where it hurts.

352
00:32:49,495 --> 00:32:53,244
–Don't touch me.
–I just want to see where it hurts.

353
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:57,614
–No, it's tension. I must be tense.
–I wouldn't be surprised.

354
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:02,956
–Relax, dammit, relax.
–Don't yell at me.

355
00:33:03,135 --> 00:33:06,420
–Does that hurt?
–No, it feels good.

356
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:11,431
You make the same sounds
for pain or happiness.

357
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:13,559
I think I'm crazy.

358
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:16,315
If it makes you feel better,
I think so too.

359
00:33:16,357 --> 00:33:20,653
It doesn't take much. The first sign
of things going wrong, I go to pieces.

360
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:22,905
Don't stop. It feels good when you rub.

361
00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:25,408
If you don't relax,
I'm gonna break my fingers.

362
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,510
Look at this –the only man
in the world with clenched hair!

363
00:33:29,537 --> 00:33:34,614
Bend over. Attaboy.
OK, now hold still.

364
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:39,669
If this hurts, Felix, tell me,
cos I don't know what I'm doing.

365
00:33:57,316 --> 00:34:02,025
–What's that noise?
–I can't breathe in here.

366
00:34:02,196 --> 00:34:04,743
It must be the dust.
Open the window.

367
00:34:04,908 --> 00:34:07,994
We're not opening
any windows on the 11th floor.

368
00:34:08,036 --> 00:34:11,701
To get some fresh air
we'll go downstairs for a walk.

369
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:19,626
I wish I were like you, Oscar, strong.
But I'm weak and I admit it.

370
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:24,341
You'll outlive today's entire generation.
You want a lick?

371
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:29,008
You don't understand.
I'm nothing without my wife and kids.

372
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:32,353
You're not nothing.
You're something. You're a person.

373
00:34:32,395 --> 00:34:35,523
You're flesh and blood,
bones, hair, nails and ears.

374
00:34:35,565 --> 00:34:38,359
You're not a fish,
you're not a buffalo, you're you.

375
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:40,862
You walk and talk and cry and complain

376
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:43,698
and eat little green pills
and send suicide telegrams.

377
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,483
No one else does that.

378
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:50,202
I'm telling you, you're the only one
of its kind in the world!

379
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:52,199
You stained me!

380
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:56,123
Chocolate ice cream stains.
That's a stain.

381
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:58,038
Ice cream doesn't stain.

382
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:02,468
Vanilla and coffee don't stain,
chocolate does! That's a stain!

383
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:06,845
Felix, leave that alone, will you?
Or you'll get a water stain.

384
00:35:07,014 --> 00:35:09,558
That won't come out.
That's permanent.

385
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,554
You ready to order now? Oh, hi!

386
00:35:12,728 --> 00:35:15,273
My little pussycat.
Come here, darling.

387
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,984
For a tip I'll leave you the key
to my apartment.

388
00:35:18,026 --> 00:35:20,980
Is it informal or can I bring my husband?

389
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:26,109
I can't wait that long. How about five
minutes behind the cash register?

390
00:35:27,202 --> 00:35:29,746
If you bite, I can't write!
What'll you have?

391
00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:32,113
A cup of hot tea, please.

392
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:35,042
Hot tea for Diamond Jim Brady.

393
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,452
Are you gonna eat anything?

394
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:39,836
I just had an ice cream.

395
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:43,590
Give me a corn beef on rye, all fat

396
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:46,003
and a high calorie cream soda.

397
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:49,299
Ain't she cute?

398
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,015
If you don't try,
how are you gonna find out?

399
00:35:57,192 --> 00:36:00,528
Easy for you and me.
We're men, we're out in the world.

400
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,323
We can meet new people.
What about Frances?

401
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:04,859
What about Frances?

402
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:09,329
It's harder on the woman. She's alone
with the kids. She can't get out like me.

403
00:36:09,371 --> 00:36:13,018
How will she meet somebody,
with two kids, and where?

404
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,829
Maybe someone
will come to the door.

405
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:20,174
–Stop talking about Frances.
–Do you want me to forget about her?

406
00:36:20,216 --> 00:36:23,636
How do you wipe out 12 years
of marriage just like that?

407
00:36:23,678 --> 00:36:28,770
Face it. You can't spend your life crying.
It annoys people in the movies.

408
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:32,979
–What's the matter?
–I'm cold. It's the air-conditioning.

409
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:37,398
–Why is it so high? I'll probably get flu.
–You want a blanket?

410
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:40,901
You've got to be careful
with air conditioning.

411
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:43,865
I never let Frances turn ours on
in the summer.

412
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:46,363
She must be crazy about that.

413
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:48,907
Let's move to another table.

414
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:56,206
I knew it.

415
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:02,333
What's the matter now?

416
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:06,923
I got this… my ears are filling up.
I got this sinus condition.

417
00:37:07,098 --> 00:37:11,728
It's the change in temperature.
I always get it from air-conditioning.

418
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,762
Maybe it'll go away.

419
00:37:13,938 --> 00:37:16,983
It's part of my allergies.
I get them in summer.

420
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:20,028
–Only in summer?
–And winter too. All year long.

421
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,902
I'm allergic to foods, pillows,
curtains and perfumes.

422
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:27,989
Can you imagine that?
That used to drive Frances crazy.

423
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:32,208
For a while she couldn't wear
anything except my aftershave lotion.

424
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:34,657
I was impossible to live with.

425
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,927
Stop that.
What are you doing?

426
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,591
I'm trying to clear up my ears.

427
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,598
You create a pressure inside your head.
It opens the Eustachian tubes.

428
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:14,079
–Did it open up?
–I think I strained my throat.

429
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:22,176
Leave yourself alone?
Don't tinker.

430
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:26,341
I know. I can't help it.
I drive everybody crazy.

431
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:31,888
A marriage counsellor
once kicked me out

432
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:34,849
and wrote on my chart “lunatic”.

433
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,984
It takes two to make a rotten marriage.

434
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:43,774
You don't know what I was like at home.

435
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:49,026
I'm a compulsive cleaner.
Always cleaning up after Frances.

436
00:38:49,205 --> 00:38:54,199
Then I'd re-cook her meals
because I'm a much better cook.

437
00:38:56,504 --> 00:39:01,546
I cooked myself right out
of a marriage. Stupid damned idiot.

438
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:05,090
Hey, Felix, don't do that.
You'll get a headache.

439
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:07,643
I can't stand it any more. It's just…

440
00:39:14,022 --> 00:39:20,690
–I hate me. Boy, do I hate me!
–You don't hate you, you love you.

441
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:24,825
–You think no one else has problems.
–I thought you were my friend.

442
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:29,247
I am. I can talk to you this way because
I love you almost as much as you do.

443
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:33,618
–Then why don't you help?
–Help you? I can't even help myself.

444
00:39:33,793 --> 00:39:36,421
You think you're impossible to live with?

445
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:40,467
Blanche would ask, “When do you
want dinner?” I'd say, “I'm not hungry.”

446
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:44,888
Then, three o'clock in the morning,
I'd wake her up and say, “Now!”

447
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,725
I've been one of the highest paid
sports writers for 14 years.

448
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:51,602
We saved $ 8.50 in pennies.

449
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:55,305
I'm never home. I gamble.
I drink like a fish.

450
00:39:55,482 --> 00:39:57,855
Lie to her every chance I get.

451
00:39:58,027 --> 00:40:02,448
For our wedding anniversary I took her
to the New York vs. Detroit hockey game.

452
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,566
She got hit by a puck.

453
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:12,031
I still can't figure out why she left me.
That's how impossible I am.

454
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:15,856
Let's get out of here.
The muggers will be here soon.

455
00:40:15,962 --> 00:40:20,007
I don't think I can take it
living alone, Oscar.

456
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:26,969
In two weeks I'll go to pieces.
How will I work and make a living?

457
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:31,145
Cry on street corners.
They'll throw you nickels. You'll work.

458
00:40:31,186 --> 00:40:33,143
Tonight, you'll sleep here.

459
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:36,734
Tomorrow get your clothes
and toothbrush and move in with me.

460
00:40:36,775 --> 00:40:38,694
It's your apartment.
I'll just be in the way.

461
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:42,365
There's eight rooms. We could go
a year without seeing each other.

462
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,824
Don't you understand?
I want you to move in.

463
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:46,869
–Why? I'm a pest.
–You don't have to keep telling me.

464
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,329
Then why do you want me to move in?

465
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:51,055
I can't stand living alone, that's why.

466
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:53,835
I'm proposing.
What do you want, a ring?

467
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,586
If you really mean it.
There's a lot I can do.

468
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,218
I'm very handy around the house.
I know how to fix things.

469
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:04,388
–I fixed my wife's hairdryer.
–I don't have one. Blanche took it.

470
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:07,099
Let me do something.
I got to do something.

471
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,644
You can take my wife's initials
off the towels. Anything you say.

472
00:41:10,686 --> 00:41:12,688
You can sleep in Brucey's room.

473
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,430
I can cook, you know.
I'm a terrific cook.

474
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:19,862
You don't have to.
I got enough potato chips to last a year.

475
00:41:19,904 --> 00:41:22,448
Two meals a day? At home?
We'll save a fortune.

476
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,076
–We got to pay alimony.
–OK, you can cook.

477
00:41:25,118 --> 00:41:28,288
You like leg of lamb?
I'll make it this weekend.

478
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:31,449
I got to call Frances.
She's got my big pot.

479
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:35,159
Will you forget Frances?
We'll get our own pots.

480
00:41:35,337 --> 00:41:38,090
Don't drive me crazy
before you move in.

481
00:41:40,717 --> 00:41:42,793
Listen, Oscar.

482
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:47,374
If I do anything that irritates you,
don't be afraid to tell me.

483
00:41:47,474 --> 00:41:50,477
It's your apartment.
I don't want to get on your nerves.

484
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:53,686
–Hello, Frances.
–I'm not here.

485
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:58,352
You haven't heard from me.
You didn't see me. And I'm not here.

486
00:41:58,528 --> 00:42:00,520
Yes, he's here.

487
00:42:01,572 --> 00:42:06,318
Is she worried?
What's she saying? Is she crying?

488
00:42:06,494 --> 00:42:09,831
Does she want to speak…
I don't want to talk to her.

489
00:42:09,873 --> 00:42:12,079
He's gonna stay here with me.

490
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,168
And you can tell her,
I'm not coming back.

491
00:42:15,337 --> 00:42:19,397
And I've taken as much as she has.
I'm human too, you know.

492
00:42:19,508 --> 00:42:22,845
She's not the only one
that's suffered in this marriage. Tell her!

493
00:42:22,886 --> 00:42:25,433
–He's fine.
–Don't tell her I'm fine.

494
00:42:25,556 --> 00:42:29,257
I was gonna kill myself.
Why did you say I'm fine?

495
00:42:29,435 --> 00:42:32,738
–I understand.
–Ask if she wants to speak to me.

496
00:42:32,772 --> 00:42:35,525
Do you want to speak to him?
Oh, you don't.

497
00:42:35,566 --> 00:42:39,350
–She doesn't?
–I understand. Good night, Frances.

498
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:45,445
She doesn't want to speak to me?
Why did she call?

499
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:51,458
She wants to know when
you're collecting your clothes.

500
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,335
She wants to have the room repainted.

501
00:42:54,503 --> 00:42:58,048
Listen, Felix, it's almost one
o'clock. Let's go to bed.

502
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,301
–She didn't want to speak to me.
–I'll get you a pair of pyjamas.

503
00:43:01,343 --> 00:43:03,683
You like stripes, dots or animals?

504
00:43:03,846 --> 00:43:06,974
I wanted to kill myself
and she's picking colours.

505
00:43:07,016 --> 00:43:10,017
How about some house slippers for you?

506
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:15,014
I'm glad. She finally
made me realise it's over.

507
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:17,485
It didn't sink in till this minute.

508
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:19,571
Felix, I want you to go to bed.

509
00:43:19,612 --> 00:43:24,571
My marriage is really over.
It doesn't seem so bad now.

510
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:27,913
–I can live with this thing.
–Live with it tomorrow.

511
00:43:27,954 --> 00:43:30,374
–Go to bed tonight.
–In a few minutes.

512
00:43:30,415 --> 00:43:32,584
I got to think and rearrange my life.

513
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:36,209
Felix, this is my apartment.
I make up the bedtime.

514
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,426
You don't understand. I want to be alone.
Go to bed and I'll clean up.

515
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:44,930
–You don't have to clean up.
–I can't sleep with the room like this.

516
00:43:44,972 --> 00:43:47,600
I'll see you in the morning.
I'll cook breakfast.

517
00:43:47,642 --> 00:43:53,182
You're not going to do anything
big like rolling up rugs, are you?

518
00:43:53,356 --> 00:43:56,108
Ten minutes,
that's all I'm gonna be.

519
00:43:56,276 --> 00:43:58,891
I'm gonna do the dishes
and go to bed.

520
00:43:59,028 --> 00:44:01,733
He's gonna do the dishes.

521
00:44:06,536 --> 00:44:09,027
–Hey, Oscar.
–Yeah?

522
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:12,871
I'm gonna be all right!
It may take a few days.

523
00:44:13,043 --> 00:44:17,919
–I'm gonna be all right.
–Good. Good night, Felix.

524
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,297
Good night, Frances.

525
00:44:28,101 --> 00:44:30,592
–Morning, Harry.
–Morning.

526
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:34,269
Hey, that's my bus.
See you tonight, Oscar.

527
00:44:42,657 --> 00:44:44,983
What'll I make for dinner?

528
00:44:56,088 --> 00:45:00,715
The batter, number
nine, Bill Mazerosky, second base.

529
00:45:05,932 --> 00:45:07,426
Strike!

530
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,765
Well, that's the ball game.

531
00:45:11,938 --> 00:45:13,847
It's not over yet.

532
00:45:14,024 --> 00:45:17,108
Bases loaded, Mazerosky up,
ninth inning—

533
00:45:17,277 --> 00:45:19,488
You expect the Mets
to hold a one-run lead?

534
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:23,108
What's the matter?
You never heard of a triple play?

535
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:26,904
Hello.

536
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:30,531
Phone for you, Madison.

537
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:32,831
I'll call him back.

538
00:45:33,002 --> 00:45:35,837
He says it's an emergency.

539
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:39,330
Yeah?

540
00:45:39,508 --> 00:45:43,763
Just called to say don't eat
any frankfurters at the game today.

541
00:45:43,805 --> 00:45:46,489
I'm making franks and beans for dinner.

542
00:45:52,564 --> 00:45:56,229
A triple play! The Mets did it!

543
00:45:56,401 --> 00:46:01,229
It was the greatest fielding play
I ever saw and you missed it!

544
00:46:03,909 --> 00:46:07,824
Are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?

545
00:46:07,997 --> 00:46:10,832
Take your frankfurters and…

546
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,122
Oscar. Hey, Oscar…

547
00:46:47,746 --> 00:46:50,293
–I'm sorry I'm late.
–Wipe your feet.

548
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:53,678
If you know what's good for you,
wipe your feet.

549
00:46:53,753 --> 00:46:55,792
How's the game going?

550
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:01,546
What happened to the apartment?

551
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:06,606
It's been given the Good Housekeeping
seal of approval. Deal the cards.

552
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:25,025
A cold glass of beer for Roy.
Where's your coaster?

553
00:47:25,202 --> 00:47:26,827
–What?
–Your coaster,

554
00:47:26,996 --> 00:47:29,707
the little round
thing that goes under the glass.

555
00:47:29,749 --> 00:47:31,825
I think I bet it.

556
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:34,253
Here. I knew I was winning too much.

557
00:47:34,295 --> 00:47:37,924
Try to use the coasters.
Scotch and a little bit of water.

558
00:47:37,966 --> 00:47:41,964
–And I have my coaster.
–You know what wet glasses do.

559
00:47:42,137 --> 00:47:45,265
–They leave little rings on the table.
–Little rings on the table.

560
00:47:45,307 --> 00:47:47,476
We don't want rings on the table.

561
00:47:47,517 --> 00:47:51,266
And we have a nice
warm sandwich for Vinnie.

562
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:54,225
It smells good! What is it?

563
00:47:54,399 --> 00:47:57,027
Bacon, lettuce and tomato
with mayonnaise on toast.

564
00:47:57,069 --> 00:47:59,238
–You just made it?
–One, two, three.

565
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,486
You cooked bacon just for me?

566
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:04,702
Don't like it,
he'll make a meatloaf in five minutes.

567
00:48:04,744 --> 00:48:07,580
Eat over the dish.
I just vacuumed the rug.

568
00:48:07,622 --> 00:48:10,788
–That's good.
–Oscar, what did you want?

569
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:14,003
Two three and a half minute eggs
and petits fours.

570
00:48:14,045 --> 00:48:17,048
Double gin and tonic, right?
Be with you in a minute.

571
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:20,187
–Who turned off the de-humidifier?
–The what?

572
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,077
I said don't play with it.
I'm trying to get the grime out of the air.

573
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:28,633
Murray, I'll give you $ 200
for your gun.

574
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,637
I can't take any more.

575
00:48:30,813 --> 00:48:35,693
We've played four minutes of poker.
I'm not watching cooking and cleaning.

576
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:39,822
I can't breathe. That lousy machine
is sucking everything out of the air.

577
00:48:39,864 --> 00:48:43,618
–This is delicious. Who wants a bite?
–I didn't have any supper. Is it warm?

578
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:47,789
–Perfect! It's a well-made sandwich.
–Cut me a little piece.

579
00:48:47,914 --> 00:48:50,583
Give me your napkin.
I don't want to drop any crumbs.

580
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:52,794
Martha and Gertrude at the Automat.

581
00:48:52,836 --> 00:48:56,506
That thing could kill us. They'll find us
with our tongues on the floor.

582
00:48:56,548 --> 00:48:59,801
Do something, Oscar.
Get him back into the game.

583
00:48:59,843 --> 00:49:03,305
Don't come to me with problems.
You get this one night a week.

584
00:49:03,347 --> 00:49:06,763
I'm cooped up with Mary Poppins
24 hours a day.

585
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:10,350
–Felix, get in here, will you?
–Coming!

586
00:49:10,521 --> 00:49:14,024
It was better before
with the garbage and the smoke.

587
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:16,736
Did you notice
what he does with the bread?

588
00:49:16,777 --> 00:49:19,405
He cuts off the crusts.
That's why the sandwich is light.

589
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:22,909
And he only uses the soft part
of the lettuce. It's delicious.

590
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,699
–I'm going out of my mind.
–Felix, get in here.

591
00:49:26,871 --> 00:49:28,365
I'm going home.

592
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,876
The day his marriage busted up
was the end of our poker game.

593
00:49:31,918 --> 00:49:34,504
You can't run out now.
I'm a big loser.

594
00:49:34,546 --> 00:49:37,092
You got no one to blame but yourself.

595
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:40,752
You're the one who stopped
him from killing himself.

596
00:49:41,303 --> 00:49:44,056
He's right. That man is absolutely right.

597
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:47,142
–Are you gonna eat that pickle?
–Why? Do you want it?

598
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,229
–Unless you want it.
–Take it. I don't usually eat pickle.

599
00:49:50,271 --> 00:49:52,886
–Deal the cards.
–Why did you do that?

600
00:49:52,898 --> 00:49:56,485
You want to play poker, deal the cards.
You want to eat, go to a delicatessen.

601
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,571
Keep your pickle
and sandwiches to yourself.

602
00:49:58,613 --> 00:50:01,657
I'm losing $ 53 here
and everybody's getting fat.

603
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:03,324
What?

604
00:50:03,493 --> 00:50:06,913
Close the stinking restaurant.
We got a poker game going on.

605
00:50:06,955 --> 00:50:10,953
Is it up to me?
Who threw a pickle on the floor?

606
00:50:11,126 --> 00:50:13,747
I don't think that's funny.

607
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,420
What is that smell? Disinfectant?

608
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:22,920
It's the cards.
He washed the cards.

609
00:50:23,097 --> 00:50:26,466
I'm getting out of here.
I can't stand any more.

610
00:50:26,642 --> 00:50:28,599
Where are you going?

611
00:50:28,769 --> 00:50:31,981
I've been breathing cleaning fluid
and ammonia for three hours.

612
00:50:32,023 --> 00:50:35,739
Nature didn't intend for poker
to be played like that.

613
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,608
OK, ready to play.

614
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,496
–We got just enough for handball.
–Where is everybody?

615
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:46,413
You got the nerve to ask?
I've just been sterilised out of $ 53.

616
00:50:46,454 --> 00:50:48,794
I'm sorry. Is it my fault, fellas?

617
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:51,001
I guess no one feels
like playing tonight.

618
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:53,628
I better be going too.
Got to get up early.

619
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,673
Bebe and I are driving
to Asbury Park for the weekend.

620
00:50:56,715 --> 00:50:59,343
That's nice. You always
do things like that together.

621
00:50:59,384 --> 00:51:02,763
We have to. I don't know how to drive.
You coming, Murray?

622
00:51:02,805 --> 00:51:04,963
Yeah, why not?

623
00:51:05,141 --> 00:51:09,395
I got to stop and get Mimi
a hero sandwich and a frozen éclair.

624
00:51:09,437 --> 00:51:14,015
Marriage! Those two playboys
sure got the life.

625
00:51:14,192 --> 00:51:16,813
Some life those playboys got.

626
00:51:22,909 --> 00:51:26,859
That's funny, isn't it. Oscar?
They think we're happy.

627
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:32,657
They think we're enjoying ourselves.

628
00:51:32,836 --> 00:51:36,048
They just don't know
what it's like living alone.

629
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:40,010
I'd be immensely grateful
if you didn't clean up just now.

630
00:51:40,052 --> 00:51:43,006
Just a few things.
But playboys, us!

631
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,929
That's really funny.
I think they actually envy us.

632
00:51:47,101 --> 00:51:50,104
–They should only know.
–Leave everything alone.

633
00:51:50,146 --> 00:51:52,523
I'm not through dirtying up for the night.

634
00:51:52,565 --> 00:51:57,144
–Don't you see the irony of it?
–Yes, I see it.

635
00:51:57,946 --> 00:52:02,367
–I don't think you see it.
–I'm telling you. I see the irony of it.

636
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:05,529
All right, tell me. What's the irony?

637
00:52:05,704 --> 00:52:11,209
Unless we come to some arrangement,
I'm gonna kill you. That's the irony of it.

638
00:52:13,712 --> 00:52:17,046
–What's wrong, Oscar?
–This system is wrong.

639
00:52:17,216 --> 00:52:20,845
I don't think two single men
living in a big apartment

640
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:23,846
should have a cleaner
house than my mother!

641
00:52:23,973 --> 00:52:27,393
What are you talking about?
You don't have to clean up.

642
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:30,480
What you do is worse.
You're always hanging up my towels.

643
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:32,815
When I smoke,
you follow me with an ashtray.

644
00:52:32,857 --> 00:52:37,195
Last night I found you washing
the kitchen floor, moaning, “Footprints.”

645
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,487
–I didn't say they were yours.
–They were mine.

646
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,410
What do you want me to do?
Climb across the cabinets?

647
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:48,328
–I just want you to walk on the floor.
–I really appreciate that.

648
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,751
I'm just trying
to keep this place liveable.

649
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:53,879
–I didn't know I irritated you that much.
–Leave my pictures alone.

650
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:58,634
–I was just trying to even them up.
–I want them uneven. They're mine.

651
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,834
Even up your own pictures.

652
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:03,882
I was wondering how long it would take.

653
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:08,101
–How long what would take?
–Before I got on your nerves.

654
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:12,732
I didn't say you got on my nerves.
Don't do that.

655
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:15,151
Same thing. You said I irritated you.

656
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:17,445
You said you irritated me.
I didn't say it.

657
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:20,073
–What did you say?
–What difference does it make?

658
00:53:20,115 --> 00:53:23,076
I was just repeating
what I thought you said.

659
00:53:23,118 --> 00:53:28,409
Don't repeat what you thought I said.
My God! That's irritating.

660
00:53:28,582 --> 00:53:33,244
–You did say it.
–I don't believe this conversation.

661
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,998
Oscar, I'm sorry.

662
00:53:35,172 --> 00:53:38,384
–I don't know what's wrong with me.
–And don't pout.

663
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:41,721
We'll fight, but don't pout.
Fighting, I win, pouting, you win.

664
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:46,029
You're right. Everything you say
about me is absolutely right.

665
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:49,854
Don't give in. I'm not always right.
Sometimes you're right.

666
00:53:49,896 --> 00:53:52,315
You're right.
I always figure I'm wrong.

667
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:55,193
–Only this time you are wrong.
–Leave me alone.

668
00:53:55,235 --> 00:54:00,063
–Don't sulk. That's like pouting.
–I know.

669
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:06,030
Damn me. Why can't I do
just one lousy thing right?

670
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:13,335
–Why didn't you throw it?
–I almost did.

671
00:54:13,504 --> 00:54:16,674
–Sometimes I get insane.
–Then why not throw the cup?

672
00:54:16,716 --> 00:54:18,843
–I'm trying to control myself.
–Why?

673
00:54:18,885 --> 00:54:20,593
What do you mean, “why”?

674
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:22,972
You were angry.
Why didn't you throw it?

675
00:54:23,014 --> 00:54:26,111
I'd still be angry
and I'd have a broken cup.

676
00:54:26,226 --> 00:54:29,254
How do you know?
Maybe you'd feel wonderful.

677
00:54:29,354 --> 00:54:32,566
Why do you control every thought
that comes into your head?

678
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:37,081
Do something you feel like doing,
not what you're supposed to do.

679
00:54:37,195 --> 00:54:40,197
Stop controlling yourself. Relax.

680
00:54:40,365 --> 00:54:44,150
Get drunk. Get angry.
Break the lousy cup.

681
00:54:45,704 --> 00:54:47,863
I hurt my arm.

682
00:54:48,749 --> 00:54:50,991
You're a hopeless mental case.

683
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:54,472
I shouldn't throw with that arm.
I got bursitis.

684
00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:57,473
Why don't you live in a closet?

685
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:01,721
I'll leave your meals outside the door
and slide in the newspapers.

686
00:55:01,763 --> 00:55:05,392
–I hurt easily and I can't help it.
–You're not gonna cry?

687
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:09,494
Those tears dripping on your arm
is what gave you bursitis.

688
00:55:15,777 --> 00:55:17,651
Let me tell you something.

689
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:20,918
I may not be the easiest person
to live with,

690
00:55:21,075 --> 00:55:24,242
but you could have done
a whole lot worse.

691
00:55:26,288 --> 00:55:30,073
–How?
–I put order in this house.

692
00:55:30,251 --> 00:55:35,838
You're saving money, sleeping
on clean sheets, eating hot meals.

693
00:55:36,007 --> 00:55:39,672
–And I did that!
–Yes, that's right.

694
00:55:39,844 --> 00:55:44,553
Then after we've had your halibut steak
and tartare sauce

695
00:55:44,724 --> 00:55:49,387
I have to spend the evening
watching you Saran wrap the leftovers.

696
00:55:49,563 --> 00:55:53,643
When are you and I gonna have
some fun and get out?

697
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:57,352
What are you talking about?
Eat over the plate.

698
00:55:57,529 --> 00:56:01,826
Fun? Getting a clear picture on
Channel Two is not my idea of whoopee.

699
00:56:01,867 --> 00:56:05,996
But we don't always watch TV.
Sometimes we read and talk.

700
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,916
I read and you talk.
I try to work and you talk.

701
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:10,867
I go to sleep and you talk.

702
00:56:11,044 --> 00:56:14,255
Your life's arranged pretty good.
I'm looking for a little entertainment.

703
00:56:14,297 --> 00:56:16,430
Are you saying I talk too much?

704
00:56:16,508 --> 00:56:19,302
I'm not complaining.
You got a lot to say.

705
00:56:19,344 --> 00:56:22,879
What's worrying me
is I'm beginning to listen.

706
00:56:23,056 --> 00:56:28,011
–You won't hear another peep out of me.
–You're gonna give me a haircut?

707
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,648
I'm gonna cut some greens
and make coleslaw for tomorrow.

708
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,902
I don't want coleslaw.
I just want some fun tonight.

709
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:39,155
–I thought you liked my coleslaw.
–I love your coleslaw.

710
00:56:39,323 --> 00:56:43,494
I'll take your coleslaw to work.
But not tonight. Let's go out.

711
00:56:43,536 --> 00:56:47,071
Let's go. It's only for you.
I don't like coleslaw.

712
00:56:47,248 --> 00:56:49,959
If you wanted to get out
why didn't you say?

713
00:56:50,001 --> 00:56:53,649
You think I like slaving
in the kitchen all day long?

714
00:56:58,301 --> 00:57:01,123
Hey, how about that?
Oscar, you're right.

715
00:57:01,138 --> 00:57:04,922
A person has to get out of the house
once in a while.

716
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:09,098
Yeah, bowling is a wonderful exercise.

717
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:13,399
But that's not the kind
of relaxation I had in mind.

718
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:16,612
–The night was made for other things.
–Like what?

719
00:57:16,654 --> 00:57:21,492
Like unless I touch something soft
in the next two weeks, I'm in trouble.

720
00:57:21,534 --> 00:57:23,990
Oh –you mean women?

721
00:57:24,162 --> 00:57:26,831
If you want to give it a name, women.

722
00:57:26,998 --> 00:57:29,542
It's funny. I haven't thought
of women in weeks.

723
00:57:29,584 --> 00:57:31,707
I fail to see the humour.

724
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:34,506
All I'm saying is
why don't we spend one night

725
00:57:34,548 --> 00:57:37,467
talking to someone
with higher voices than us?

726
00:57:37,509 --> 00:57:40,130
–You mean…
–That's what I mean.

727
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,432
–I can't.
–Why not?

728
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:50,074
I'm not ready for it yet.
I don't want to discuss it. Let's bowl.

729
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,574
I intend to go out.
I get as lonely as the next fella.

730
00:57:59,615 --> 00:58:03,263
But I've only been separated
two weeks. Give me time.

731
00:58:03,328 --> 00:58:05,955
There is no time left.
I saw a TV guide.

732
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:09,042
There's nothing on this week ‐
12 in the corner.

733
00:58:09,084 --> 00:58:11,461
What am I asking, for crying out loud?

734
00:58:11,503 --> 00:58:14,506
All I want is dinner and some laughs
with a couple of girls.

735
00:58:14,548 --> 00:58:17,301
Can't you go yourself?
Why do you need me?

736
00:58:17,342 --> 00:58:19,382
I may want to come back

737
00:58:19,553 --> 00:58:23,223
and if we find you washing windows,
it puts a damper on things.

738
00:58:23,265 --> 00:58:25,142
I'll take a pill and go to sleep.

739
00:58:25,184 --> 00:58:27,757
Why take a pill when you take a girl?

740
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:31,981
I would feel guilty.
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

741
00:58:32,149 --> 00:58:34,308
Go ahead and shoot.

742
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:44,704
And anyway,
I don't know any single girls.

743
00:58:44,746 --> 00:58:47,958
Leave that to me. There are two
English sisters in our building.

744
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:51,211
One's a widow, the other's a divorcee.
They're a barrel of laughs.

745
00:58:51,253 --> 00:58:55,215
–How do you know?
–I was trapped in the elevator with them.

746
00:58:55,257 --> 00:59:00,382
–Please, say yes.
–If it means that much to you.

747
00:59:00,554 --> 00:59:03,057
That's the Felix I've been waiting for.

748
00:59:03,098 --> 00:59:06,799
–What do they look like?
–Yours is very pretty.

749
00:59:13,443 --> 00:59:15,482
We're set. 7:30 tomorrow.

750
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:17,906
–Which one do I get?
–The divorcee.

751
00:59:17,947 --> 00:59:20,784
–Why do I get the divorcee?
–You want the widow?

752
00:59:20,825 --> 00:59:24,037
I don't want the widow or the divorcee.
I'm doing this for you.

753
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,123
Take whoever you want.
Just point to the sister of your choice.

754
00:59:27,165 --> 00:59:28,817
I just want some laughs.

755
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:31,169
What are they?
Old? You know, how?

756
00:59:31,211 --> 00:59:33,881
–30,35? Older?
–They're young kids.

757
00:59:34,047 --> 00:59:37,259
Where did you say you met them?
Did they want to meet me?

758
00:59:37,301 --> 00:59:42,592
Don't suddenly call one of them Frances!
It's Gwendolyn and Cecily.

759
00:59:42,765 --> 00:59:46,632
Not Frances.
Gwendolyn and Cecily.

760
00:59:49,689 --> 00:59:54,232
Rule Britannia,
Britannia rule the waves…

761
00:59:54,402 --> 00:59:56,940
Supposing my kids see me?

762
00:59:57,113 --> 00:59:59,699
I'm going to nightclubs with foreign girls.

763
00:59:59,741 --> 01:00:02,150
I got two American kids to support.

764
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:10,538
Where are we gonna have dinner?

765
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:14,326
Anywhere you say. Chinese, ltalian…

766
01:00:14,503 --> 01:00:17,340
You mean a restaurant?
It will cost a fortune.

767
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:20,718
We cut down on laundry.
We don't wear socks on Thursdays.

768
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,056
We can't afford restaurants.
I'll cook and we'll save 30 or 40 dollars.

769
01:00:25,098 --> 01:00:29,060
What kind of double date is that?
You'll be in the kitchen all night.

770
01:00:29,102 --> 01:00:31,098
I put it up in the afternoon.

771
01:00:31,104 --> 01:00:33,982
Once my potatoes are in,
I got all the time in the world.

772
01:00:34,024 --> 01:00:37,110
What happened to the new Felix?
Who are you calling?

773
01:00:37,152 --> 01:00:39,780
Frances.
I want her recipe for meatloaf.

774
01:00:39,821 --> 01:00:42,526
The girls will be crazy about it.

775
01:01:01,427 --> 01:01:04,381
–I'd like fresh ground.
–That's fresh.

776
01:01:04,556 --> 01:01:07,343
That's packaged.
I want fresh.

777
01:01:07,517 --> 01:01:10,269
–How much?
–Four pounds exactly.

778
01:01:15,942 --> 01:01:18,019
Is that one ripe?

779
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:22,531
Not for tonight. A couple of days.

780
01:01:29,957 --> 01:01:34,915
Hey! Beautiful!
Beautiful!

781
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:45,344
I'm home, dear!

782
01:01:54,816 --> 01:01:59,443
Something wonderful
is going on in that kitchen.

783
01:01:59,613 --> 01:02:03,481
No doubt about it,
I am the luckiest man on earth.

784
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:06,328
Felix, listen, I got the wine.

785
01:02:06,495 --> 01:02:08,873
Batard Montrachet, six and a quarter.

786
01:02:08,914 --> 01:02:12,710
You don't mind, pussycat?
We can walk to work this week.

787
01:02:12,752 --> 01:02:14,294
You did a great job.

788
01:02:14,462 --> 01:02:17,966
One suggestion.
Let's come down a little with the lights

789
01:02:18,007 --> 01:02:20,795
and up very softly with the music.

790
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:24,967
Hey, you think Mozart goes good
with meatloaf?

791
01:02:28,977 --> 01:02:33,732
What's the matter? Something's wrong.
I can tell from your conversation.

792
01:02:33,774 --> 01:02:37,724
–All right, Felix, what is it?
–What is it?

793
01:02:38,946 --> 01:02:43,284
–Let's start with what time you think it is.
–What time? I don't know. 7:30?

794
01:02:43,325 --> 01:02:47,074
–Try 8:00.
–All right. So it's 8:00. So?

795
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:49,453
You said you'd be home at 7:00.

796
01:02:49,624 --> 01:02:52,789
–Is that what I said?
–“I'll be home at 7:00.”

797
01:02:52,877 --> 01:02:57,282
So I said I'd be home at 7:00
and it's 8:00. What's the problem?

798
01:02:57,382 --> 01:03:01,000
If you knew you'd be late,
why didn't you call?

799
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:07,059
–I couldn't, I was busy.
–Too busy to phone? Where were you?

800
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,770
–In the office, working.
–In the office, working?

801
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:12,350
I called at 7:00.
You were gone.

802
01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:14,312
I couldn't get a cab home.

803
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,486
Since when do they have cabs
in Hannigan's Bar?

804
01:03:17,528 --> 01:03:21,932
Wait. I want this on a tape recorder.
Nobody's gonna believe me.

805
01:03:22,074 --> 01:03:25,328
Now I've got to call you
if I'm coming home late for dinner?

806
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:26,780
Not any dinner.

807
01:03:26,954 --> 01:03:30,333
Just the ones I've been slaving over
since 5:00 this afternoon

808
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:33,253
to help you save
to pay your wife's alimony.

809
01:03:33,294 --> 01:03:37,838
Felix, this is no time
to have a domestic quarrel.

810
01:03:38,008 --> 01:03:41,708
We got two girls coming down
here any minute!

811
01:03:41,887 --> 01:03:44,378
You told them to be here at 8:00?

812
01:03:44,556 --> 01:03:48,227
I don't remember what I said ‐
7:30,8:00. What's the difference?

813
01:03:48,268 --> 01:03:51,503
I'll tell you.
You said they'd be here at 7:30.

814
01:03:51,522 --> 01:03:54,859
You were gonna be here at 7:00,
help me with the hors d'œuvres

815
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,570
and at 7:30 they get here,
we have cocktails.

816
01:03:57,611 --> 01:04:02,498
At 8:00 we're gonna eat dinner.
It's now 8:00 and the meatloaf is done.

817
01:04:02,575 --> 01:04:06,663
If we don't eat within 15 seconds,
the damned thing will be dried out.

818
01:04:06,704 --> 01:04:08,364
God help me.

819
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:11,636
Never mind you.
Tell him to save my meatloaf.

820
01:04:15,213 --> 01:04:18,884
–Can't you keep it warm?
–You think I'm the magic chef?

821
01:04:18,925 --> 01:04:22,010
I'm lucky I got it
to come out at 8:00.

822
01:04:22,179 --> 01:04:25,766
–What am I gonna do?
–I don't know. Pour gravy on it.

823
01:04:25,808 --> 01:04:29,353
–Don't you have any gravy?
–Where do I get gravy at 8:00?

824
01:04:29,395 --> 01:04:32,728
I thought it comes
when you cook the meat.

825
01:04:32,898 --> 01:04:37,311
You don't know what you're talking about.
You just don't know.

826
01:04:37,486 --> 01:04:39,822
You got to make gravy.
It doesn't come.

827
01:04:39,864 --> 01:04:42,200
–You asked my advice…
–Your advice?

828
01:04:42,241 --> 01:04:45,537
You didn't even know
where this kitchen was till I showed you.

829
01:04:45,578 --> 01:04:48,698
You want to talk, buddy?
Put down that spoon.

830
01:04:48,873 --> 01:04:51,625
You dumb ignoramus,
that is a ladle!

831
01:04:51,793 --> 01:04:55,785
–You did not know that's a ladle.
–Get a hold of yourself.

832
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:59,092
You think it's so easy?
The kitchen's all yours.

833
01:04:59,134 --> 01:05:03,180
You make a meatloaf for four people
that come a half hour late!

834
01:05:03,222 --> 01:05:05,265
I'm arguing with him over gravy.

835
01:05:05,307 --> 01:05:08,593
They're here.
I'll get a saw and cut the meat.

836
01:05:08,769 --> 01:05:10,928
I want to tell you something.

837
01:05:11,105 --> 01:05:13,733
I'm not taking the blame for this dinner.

838
01:05:13,774 --> 01:05:16,859
–Who even cares about the dinner?
–I care.

839
01:05:17,028 --> 01:05:20,907
I take pride in what I do
and you're gonna explain what happened.

840
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:23,785
You can take a picture of me
coming in at 8:00.

841
01:05:23,827 --> 01:05:27,038
Take off that stupid apron.
I'm opening the door.

842
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,626
This is the last time I cook for you.

843
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:32,085
You don't even appreciate a decent meal.

844
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:35,130
–That's why they have TV dinners.
–Are you through?

845
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:36,796
Then smile.

846
01:05:39,676 --> 01:05:42,631
–Hi there.
–Hello.

847
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:47,467
–I hope we're not late.
–You timed it perfectly. Come in.

848
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:52,352
–Oh, isn't this lovely?
–Thank you very much.

849
01:05:52,523 --> 01:05:56,859
Felix, I'd like you to meet two elevator
acquaintances of mine.

850
01:05:58,947 --> 01:06:02,861
–Gwendolyn and Cecily.
–No, Cecily and Gwendolyn.

851
01:06:03,034 --> 01:06:05,120
Terribly sorry.
Cecily and Gwendolyn.

852
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:07,913
–Don't tell me, Robin?
–No.

853
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:11,497
–Cardinal?
–Wrong both times. It's Pigeon.

854
01:06:11,668 --> 01:06:16,129
Cecily and Gwendolyn Pigeon.
The Pigeon sisters.

855
01:06:16,298 --> 01:06:21,322
Or as our friends in Chelsea used to
call us, the Coo-Coo Pigeon sisters.

856
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,088
–I like that.
–Thank you.

857
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:31,397
Girls, I'd like you to meet my roommate
and our chef, Mr Felix Ungar.

858
01:06:31,439 --> 01:06:34,393
–How do you do?
–How do you do?

859
01:06:38,655 --> 01:06:41,146
Well, we did that beautifully.

860
01:06:41,324 --> 01:06:44,411
Shall we sit down
and make ourselves comfortable?

861
01:06:44,452 --> 01:06:46,492
This is so nice.

862
01:06:46,663 --> 01:06:48,455
Perfume.

863
01:06:48,623 --> 01:06:51,328
Shall I sit here?

864
01:06:51,501 --> 01:06:53,790
Sure, any place you like.

865
01:06:53,962 --> 01:06:56,454
Don't sit on the hors d'œuvre!

866
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:10,597
This is ever so nice, isn't it Gwen?

867
01:07:10,772 --> 01:07:14,626
And it's so much neater than our flat.
Do you have help?

868
01:07:14,651 --> 01:07:17,936
Yes, I have a man
who comes in every night.

869
01:07:18,113 --> 01:07:20,948
Well, aren't you the lucky one?

870
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:31,158
This is really nice.

871
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:36,459
I was telling Felix
only yesterday how we met.

872
01:07:36,632 --> 01:07:39,088
–Who's Felix?
–He is.

873
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,798
Oh, yes, of course. Sorry.

874
01:07:41,971 --> 01:07:44,932
You know, it happened to us
again this morning?

875
01:07:44,974 --> 01:07:48,390
–Stuck in the lift again.
–Just the two of you?

876
01:07:48,561 --> 01:07:51,773
And Mr Kessler from the third floor
for nearly half an hour.

877
01:07:51,815 --> 01:07:53,891
Is that right? What happened?

878
01:07:54,067 --> 01:07:56,558
Nothing much, I'm afraid.

879
01:07:56,736 --> 01:07:59,524
Oh, honestly! Gwen!

880
01:08:13,963 --> 01:08:16,002
This is really nice.

881
01:08:17,299 --> 01:08:20,550
And ever so much cooler
than our place.

882
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,140
It's like Equatorial Africa
on our side of the building.

883
01:08:24,182 --> 01:08:28,394
Last night it was so bad,
Gwen and I sat there in nature's own

884
01:08:28,436 --> 01:08:30,605
cooling ourselves in front of the fridge.

885
01:08:30,647 --> 01:08:34,727
–Can you imagine such a thing?
–I'm working on it.

886
01:08:34,901 --> 01:08:36,645
Honestly!

887
01:08:37,362 --> 01:08:42,701
It's impossible to get a night's sleep.
Cec and I don't know what to do.

888
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:45,662
Why don't you sleep
with an air-conditioner?

889
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:48,990
–We haven't got one.
–I know, but we have.

890
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:52,500
I told you about that one, didn't I?

891
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,060
They say it may rain, Friday.

892
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:19,607
That should cool things off a bit.

893
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:22,403
Yes, I wouldn't be surprised.

894
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:26,491
Although sometimes it gets hotter
after it rains.

895
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:31,373
–Yes it does, doesn't it?
–Yes, sometimes it gets hotter.

896
01:09:34,589 --> 01:09:37,210
–Dinner's served.
–No, it isn't!

897
01:09:37,383 --> 01:09:40,970
I'm sure the girls would like
a cocktail first, wouldn't you?

898
01:09:41,012 --> 01:09:44,224
–I wouldn't put up a struggle.
–What would you like?

899
01:09:44,265 --> 01:09:46,721
I don't know. What have you got?

900
01:09:46,893 --> 01:09:48,518
–Meatloaf.
–Oh.

901
01:09:48,687 --> 01:09:51,314
She means to drink.
We have everything.

902
01:09:51,356 --> 01:09:55,073
And what we don't have,
I mix in the medicine cabinet.

903
01:09:56,403 --> 01:10:00,781
–What'll it be?
–Oh, a double vodka.

904
01:10:00,949 --> 01:10:03,160
Darling, please not before dinner.

905
01:10:03,202 --> 01:10:07,449
My sister, honestly.
She watches over me like a mother hen!

906
01:10:07,623 --> 01:10:09,699
Make it a small double vodka.

907
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:13,661
A small double vodka.
And for the beautiful mother hen?

908
01:10:17,175 --> 01:10:20,211
Well, I think I'd like something cool.

909
01:10:21,554 --> 01:10:26,217
I know. I would like a double Drambuie
with crushed ice.

910
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:29,228
Unless you haven't got crushed ice.

911
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:34,307
I was up all night with a sledgehammer.
I shall return.

912
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:39,028
–Where are you going?
–To get the refreshments.

913
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:43,611
–Inside? What am I gonna do?
–You can finish the weather report.

914
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:46,264
Don't forget to look at my meatloaf.

915
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:28,992
–Oscar tells me you're sisters.
–Yes. That's right.

916
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:31,206
From England.

917
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:35,457
I see. We're not brothers.

918
01:11:37,467 --> 01:11:39,709
Yes. We know.

919
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:45,347
Although I am a brother.
I have a brother.

920
01:11:45,517 --> 01:11:48,812
He's a doctor in Buffalo.
That's up state New York.

921
01:11:48,854 --> 01:11:51,606
–Yes, we know.
–You know my brother?

922
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:55,024
No. We know Buffalo
is up state in New York.

923
01:11:55,194 --> 01:11:56,937
Yes, thank you.

924
01:11:57,113 --> 01:11:59,236
We've been there. Have you?

925
01:11:59,407 --> 01:12:01,471
–No. Is it nice?
–It's lovely.

926
01:12:01,534 --> 01:12:03,527
Isn't that interesting?

927
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,827
Silly me. Thank you.

928
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:28,301
How long have you two been
in the United States of America?

929
01:12:29,355 --> 01:12:32,558
–Four? Four in June.
–Almost four years now.

930
01:12:33,692 --> 01:12:36,610
–Just visiting?
–No. We live here.

931
01:12:36,779 --> 01:12:39,068
–Do you work here too?
–Oh yes.

932
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,062
Yes, we're secretaries for a health club.

933
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:46,581
People bring us their bodies
and we do wonderful things with them.

934
01:12:46,623 --> 01:12:49,292
If you're interested,

935
01:12:49,459 --> 01:12:52,377
Off the price, not off your body.

936
01:12:56,216 --> 01:12:58,838
Oscar, where are the drinks?

937
01:13:07,728 --> 01:13:10,963
And what field of endeavour
are you engaged in?

938
01:13:10,981 --> 01:13:14,766
–I write the news for television.
–Oh, fascinating.

939
01:13:14,944 --> 01:13:17,779
Where do you get your ideas from?

940
01:13:22,619 --> 01:13:24,077
From…

941
01:13:25,121 --> 01:13:26,532
…the news.

942
01:13:26,706 --> 01:13:28,865
Oh yes, of course. Silly me.

943
01:13:29,042 --> 01:13:32,170
Maybe you can mention
Gwen and I in one of your reports.

944
01:13:32,212 --> 01:13:35,465
If you do something spectacular,
then maybe I will.

945
01:13:35,507 --> 01:13:38,129
We've done spectacular things

946
01:13:38,302 --> 01:13:42,347
but I don't think we want it
all over the telly!

947
01:13:47,228 --> 01:13:48,770
Oscar!

948
01:13:50,564 --> 01:13:53,901
This apartment is so big,
sometimes you have to holler.

949
01:13:53,943 --> 01:13:55,485
Oh.

950
01:13:55,653 --> 01:13:57,942
Just you two baches live here?

951
01:13:59,407 --> 01:14:02,693
Baches? Oh, you mean bachelors.

952
01:14:02,869 --> 01:14:05,906
We're not bachelors.
We're divorced.

953
01:14:06,081 --> 01:14:10,161
That is Oscar's divorced
and I'm getting…

954
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:14,796
Small world. We've cut the dinghy
loose too, as they say.

955
01:14:14,965 --> 01:14:18,302
You couldn't have a better matched
foursome, could you?

956
01:14:18,344 --> 01:14:20,253
No, I suppose not.

957
01:14:20,429 --> 01:14:23,264
Although, technically I am a widow.

958
01:14:23,432 --> 01:14:25,840
I was divorcing my husband

959
01:14:26,018 --> 01:14:29,470
but he died before the final papers
came through.

960
01:14:33,568 --> 01:14:36,779
I'm awfully sorry.
Divorce is a terrible thing, isn't it?

961
01:14:36,821 --> 01:14:39,240
It can be if you haven't got
the right solicitor.

962
01:14:39,282 --> 01:14:42,577
That's true.
Sometimes it can drag out for months.

963
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:45,038
I was lucky. Snip, cut and I was free.

964
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:50,205
But of course, that's all water
under the bridge now, isn't it?

965
01:14:51,712 --> 01:14:56,255
I'm terribly sorry,
I think I've forgotten your name.

966
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,334
–Felix.
–Of course, Felix.

967
01:14:58,511 --> 01:15:01,180
–Like the cat.
–The cat.

968
01:15:01,347 --> 01:15:06,258
Well, the Pigeons will have to beware
of the cat, won't they?

969
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,310
That's the worst part about breaking up.

970
01:15:15,653 --> 01:15:18,145
Childhood sweethearts, were you?

971
01:15:18,323 --> 01:15:22,035
No, that's my little boy and girl.
He's seven. She's five.

972
01:15:22,077 --> 01:15:23,619
Oh, sweet.

973
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:25,827
They live with their mother.

974
01:15:25,998 --> 01:15:28,619
I imagine you must miss them terribly.

975
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:33,297
I can't stand being away from them.
But that's what happens with divorce.

976
01:15:33,339 --> 01:15:37,551
–When do you see them?
–Every night. I drop by on the way home.

977
01:15:37,593 --> 01:15:42,006
And I take them on weekends
and holidays, July and August.

978
01:15:43,057 --> 01:15:46,310
–When is that you miss them?
–Whenever I'm not there.

979
01:15:46,352 --> 01:15:48,896
If they didn't have to go
to school so early,

980
01:15:48,938 --> 01:15:52,192
I'd make them breakfast.
They love my French toast.

981
01:15:52,233 --> 01:15:54,444
You certainly are a devoted father.

982
01:15:54,486 --> 01:15:57,322
–It's Frances who's wonderful.
–She's the little girl?

983
01:15:57,364 --> 01:16:00,575
–No, she's the mother. My wife.
–The one you're divorcing?

984
01:16:00,617 --> 01:16:03,576
She's done a terrific job
bringing them up.

985
01:16:03,662 --> 01:16:06,140
They always look so nice, so polite.

986
01:16:06,206 --> 01:16:08,792
They speak beautifully.
Never “yeah”, always “yes”.

987
01:16:08,834 --> 01:16:12,084
They're such good kids.
And she's done it all.

988
01:16:12,254 --> 01:16:16,667
She's a wonderful woman.
She's the kind of woman who…

989
01:16:16,842 --> 01:16:19,679
What am I talking?
You're not interested in any of this.

990
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,887
Nonsense! You've a right to be proud.

991
01:16:23,057 --> 01:16:27,055
You have two beautiful children
and a wonderful ex-wife.

992
01:16:27,228 --> 01:16:28,972
There's Frances, see?

993
01:16:29,147 --> 01:16:33,394
Oh, she's pretty.
Isn't she pretty Cecy?

994
01:16:33,568 --> 01:16:36,596
–Oh yes, a pretty girl.
–Yes, she is pretty.

995
01:16:36,613 --> 01:16:38,855
Isn't that nice?

996
01:16:39,574 --> 01:16:42,619
–There's no one in the picture.
–I know. That's our living room.

997
01:16:42,661 --> 01:16:46,529
–We had a beautiful apartment.
–It's very pretty.

998
01:16:46,707 --> 01:16:49,328
–Those are lovely lamps.
–Thank you.

999
01:16:49,502 --> 01:16:53,334
We got those in Mexico…
on our honeymoon.

1000
01:16:54,924 --> 01:16:57,093
I used to love to come home at night.

1001
01:16:57,134 --> 01:17:01,126
That was my whole life.
My wife and kids and my apartment.

1002
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:14,108
Does she have the lamps now, too?

1003
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:20,490
Yes. I gave her everything.
My children and the lamps.

1004
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:26,619
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get emotional.

1005
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:31,231
Would you like some potato chips?

1006
01:17:35,258 --> 01:17:39,719
Please, please.
You mustn't be ashamed.

1007
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:44,016
It's a rare quality in a man
to be able to cry.

1008
01:17:44,184 --> 01:17:49,771
So do I. I think it's sweet.
Terribly, terribly sweet.

1009
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:52,265
You're just making it worse.

1010
01:17:52,442 --> 01:17:57,742
It's so refreshing to hear a man speak
so highly of the woman he's divorcing.

1011
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:04,117
Oh dear. Now you've got me thinking
about poor Sydney.

1012
01:18:04,288 --> 01:18:06,079
Gwen, please don't.

1013
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:09,582
It was a good marriage
at first, wasn't it?

1014
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:14,663
Everybody said so, didn't they?
Not like you and George.

1015
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:18,791
No, that's right.
George and I were never happy.

1016
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:22,671
Not for one single, solitary day.

1017
01:18:24,601 --> 01:18:27,854
–This is ridiculous.
–I don't know what brought this on.

1018
01:18:27,896 --> 01:18:30,440
I was feeling so good a few minutes ago.

1019
01:18:30,482 --> 01:18:33,317
I haven't cried since I was 14.

1020
01:18:37,656 --> 01:18:40,064
Is everybody happy?

1021
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:49,408
–What happened?
–Nothing.

1022
01:18:49,585 --> 01:18:53,298
Nothing? I'm gone three minutes
and I walk into a funeral parlour.

1023
01:18:53,339 --> 01:18:56,506
–What did you say?
–I didn't say anything.

1024
01:18:56,676 --> 01:18:59,054
I can't leave you alone for five seconds.

1025
01:18:59,095 --> 01:19:02,140
If you really want to cry,
look at your meatloaf.

1026
01:19:02,182 --> 01:19:04,091
Why didn't you call me?

1027
01:19:06,061 --> 01:19:10,688
Girls, I'm terribly sorry.
I forgot to warn you about Felix.

1028
01:19:10,858 --> 01:19:13,645
He's a walking soap opera.

1029
01:19:13,819 --> 01:19:17,734
I think he's the dearest thing
I've ever met.

1030
01:19:17,907 --> 01:19:21,323
He's so sensitive, so fragile.

1031
01:19:21,494 --> 01:19:27,497
I just want to bundle him up in my arms
and take care of him.

1032
01:19:35,342 --> 01:19:39,262
I think when he comes out of that
kitchen, you may have to.

1033
01:19:39,304 --> 01:19:42,720
I'm gonna get some corned beef
sandwiches.

1034
01:19:42,891 --> 01:19:48,230
No, wait, Felix.
Maybe we can salvage it.

1035
01:19:48,397 --> 01:19:52,810
–Yeah, let's see it.
–See what, $ 4.80 worth of ashes?

1036
01:19:52,985 --> 01:19:56,977
I'd throw it down the incinerator
but it won't burn twice.

1037
01:19:59,367 --> 01:20:03,863
I've got a wonderful idea.
Why don't we eat at our place?

1038
01:20:04,038 --> 01:20:07,617
–That's a wonderful idea!
–You'd be taking pot luck.

1039
01:20:07,667 --> 01:20:11,383
–I'm crazy about pot luck!
–It's awfully hot up there.

1040
01:20:11,546 --> 01:20:13,542
We can open the refrigerator.

1041
01:20:13,715 --> 01:20:17,177
Give us five minutes
to get into our cooking things.

1042
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:19,388
Can't you make it four?
I'm starving.

1043
01:20:19,429 --> 01:20:22,432
–Don't forget the wine.
–How could I forget the wine?

1044
01:20:22,474 --> 01:20:24,633
–And a corkscrew.
–And Felix.

1045
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:27,811
I won't forget Felix. Ta ta.

1046
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:30,269
–Ta ta.
–Ta ta.

1047
01:20:31,192 --> 01:20:34,726
You bet your sweet little crumpets. Ta ta.

1048
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:38,281
Felix, baby, I love ya.

1049
01:20:38,449 --> 01:20:41,494
You just overcooked us
into one hell of a night.

1050
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,871
Get the ice bucket.
I got the wine.

1051
01:20:43,913 --> 01:20:45,989
I'm not going.

1052
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,743
I said I'm not going.

1053
01:20:48,918 --> 01:20:53,331
Are you out of your mind?
Do you know what's waiting for us?

1054
01:20:53,507 --> 01:20:57,636
You've been invited to spend
the evening in a two bedroom hothouse

1055
01:20:57,678 --> 01:21:01,098
with the Coo-Coo Pigeon sisters.
What do you mean, “you're not going”?

1056
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:04,935
I've nothing left to say.
I already told them about my brother.

1057
01:21:04,977 --> 01:21:07,248
I've used up all my conversation.

1058
01:21:07,271 --> 01:21:11,898
They're crazy about you.
They're nuts about you. They told me.

1059
01:21:12,068 --> 01:21:15,071
One of them
wants to wrap you up into a bundle.

1060
01:21:15,112 --> 01:21:18,324
You're doing better than I am.
Come on, get the ice bucket.

1061
01:21:18,366 --> 01:21:21,035
Don't you understand?
I cried in front of two women.

1062
01:21:21,077 --> 01:21:25,290
And they loved it. I'm thinking
of getting hysterical. Come on.

1063
01:21:25,331 --> 01:21:28,585
I'm still emotionally tied
to Frances and the kids.

1064
01:21:28,627 --> 01:21:31,087
I don't want to talk about it any more.

1065
01:21:31,129 --> 01:21:34,333
I'm gonna scrub the pots
and wash my hair.

1066
01:21:34,508 --> 01:21:38,375
Your pots and your hair can wait.
You're coming with me.

1067
01:21:38,554 --> 01:21:40,214
I'm not going.

1068
01:21:40,389 --> 01:21:44,387
What am I going to do up there
with two girls?

1069
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,225
If I miss this opportunity,
I'll never forgive you.

1070
01:21:51,108 --> 01:21:54,193
You're not gonna
make any effort to change?

1071
01:21:54,362 --> 01:21:57,665
This is the person
you're gonna be till you die?

1072
01:21:59,659 --> 01:22:02,197
We are what we are.

1073
01:22:23,893 --> 01:22:26,728
It's 12 floors not 11.

1074
01:25:35,301 --> 01:25:36,843
Ah!

1075
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:54,736
Hello, sports fans.

1076
01:25:54,905 --> 01:25:58,117
Speculation is running high
among Yankee followers

1077
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:01,870
as to the possibility of trading away
the great Hank Moonjean

1078
01:26:01,912 --> 01:26:06,110
for three unknown players
and an undetermined amount of cash.

1079
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:10,421
Moonjean has racked up ten wins
against only three losses this year

1080
01:26:10,463 --> 01:26:13,832
which is, incidentally,
high for both leagues.

1081
01:26:14,008 --> 01:26:18,619
It looks like the Yankee office
will be bombarded by many protests…

1082
01:27:05,062 --> 01:27:07,268
How long is this gonna go on?

1083
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:10,524
You talking to me?
What do you want to know?

1084
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:15,992
If you gonna spend the rest of your life
not talking to me, I'll get a radio.

1085
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:21,910
You had your chance to talk last night.
I begged you to come.

1086
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:24,155
Here's a key to the back door.

1087
01:27:24,332 --> 01:27:28,252
You stick to the hallway and your room
and you won't get hurt.

1088
01:27:28,294 --> 01:27:29,670
Meaning what?

1089
01:27:29,837 --> 01:27:34,634
If you want to live here, I don't want
to see you or smell your cooking.

1090
01:27:34,676 --> 01:27:38,460
Now, kindly remove that spaghetti
from my poker table.

1091
01:27:42,726 --> 01:27:47,305
–What's so funny?
–It's not spaghetti. It's linguini!

1092
01:27:58,618 --> 01:28:00,326
Now it's garbage.

1093
01:28:11,548 --> 01:28:15,628
You're crazy. I'm a neurotic nut
but you're crazy.

1094
01:28:15,802 --> 01:28:19,519
That's really funny,
coming from a fruitcake like you.

1095
01:28:19,598 --> 01:28:23,263
–I'm not cleaning that up.
–Is that a promise?

1096
01:28:23,435 --> 01:28:27,184
Did you hear what I said?
I'm not cleaning your mess.

1097
01:28:27,356 --> 01:28:31,021
Look at it.
It's hanging all over the wall.

1098
01:28:33,863 --> 01:28:35,143
I like it.

1099
01:28:36,908 --> 01:28:40,656
You'd just let it hang there,
wouldn't you?

1100
01:28:40,828 --> 01:28:45,953
Till it got all hard and brown
and… disgusting.

1101
01:28:46,126 --> 01:28:49,874
–I'm cleaning it.
–Leave that alone.

1102
01:28:50,046 --> 01:28:54,958
Touch one strand
and I'll punch you right in the sinuses!

1103
01:28:55,135 --> 01:28:57,804
Oscar, come on, now!

1104
01:28:57,971 --> 01:29:00,380
Why don't you take a tranquilliser?

1105
01:29:00,516 --> 01:29:03,386
Go to your room.
Do you hear?

1106
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,352
Let's just settle down.

1107
01:29:09,692 --> 01:29:12,820
I'm warning you, Felix.
You want to live through this night,

1108
01:29:12,862 --> 01:29:16,578
you better keep this door locked
and your windows too!

1109
01:29:48,357 --> 01:29:51,867
All right, Oscar.
I'd like to know what's happened.

1110
01:29:53,738 --> 01:29:56,658
Something made you go off
the deep end. What is it?

1111
01:29:56,699 --> 01:30:01,243
–Is it something I said or did?
–Nothing you said, don't start me.

1112
01:30:01,413 --> 01:30:05,197
Oscar, what is it?
Is it the cooking? Or the cleaning?

1113
01:30:05,375 --> 01:30:08,816
I'll tell you. It's the cooking,
cleaning, crying…

1114
01:30:08,962 --> 01:30:11,096
It's the talking in your sleep.

1115
01:30:11,214 --> 01:30:16,238
It's those moose calls that open your
ears at two o'clock in the morning.

1116
01:30:18,931 --> 01:30:22,101
I can't take it anymore, Felix.
I'm cracking up.

1117
01:30:22,143 --> 01:30:24,384
Everything you do irritates me.

1118
01:30:24,562 --> 01:30:28,858
When you're not here, the things
I know you're gonna do irritate me.

1119
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:31,360
You leave me little notes on my pillow.

1120
01:30:31,402 --> 01:30:36,111
I told you 158 times,
I can't stand little notes on my pillow.

1121
01:30:36,282 --> 01:30:38,952
“We are all out of cornflakes, FU.”

1122
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:43,317
It took me three hours to figure out
that FU was Felix Ungar.

1123
01:30:53,050 --> 01:30:56,637
It's not your fault, Felix.
It's a rotten combination, that's all.

1124
01:30:56,679 --> 01:30:58,506
I get the picture.

1125
01:30:58,681 --> 01:31:01,433
I haven't even painted a picture yet.

1126
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,266
I got a typewritten list in my office

1127
01:31:05,438 --> 01:31:09,108
of the ten most aggravating things
you do that drive me berserk.

1128
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:11,215
But last night was the topper.

1129
01:31:11,277 --> 01:31:16,354
Oh, brother, that was the topper,
the ever loving Lulu of all times!

1130
01:31:17,534 --> 01:31:21,746
I had it all set up with those
English sisters and I wind up drinking tea,

1131
01:31:21,788 --> 01:31:26,293
–and telling them your life story.
–I warned you not to make that date.

1132
01:31:26,335 --> 01:31:29,880
Don't point that finger,
unless you intend to use it.

1133
01:31:29,922 --> 01:31:33,300
–Get off my back.
–What's this? A display of temper?

1134
01:31:33,342 --> 01:31:37,972
I haven't seen you really angry since
I dropped my cigar in your pancake batter.

1135
01:31:38,013 --> 01:31:42,268
You're asking to hear something
I don't wanna say, but you ought to hear it.

1136
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:46,272
If you've got anything on your chest
besides your chin, get it off.

1137
01:31:46,314 --> 01:31:48,585
All right then, you asked for it!

1138
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:52,779
You're a wonderful guy, Oscar!
You've done everything for me!

1139
01:31:52,821 --> 01:31:56,116
If it weren't for you, I don't know
what would have happened to me.

1140
01:31:56,157 --> 01:31:59,578
You gave me a place to live,
something to live for.

1141
01:31:59,619 --> 01:32:04,614
I'm never gonna forget you for that.
You're tops with me!

1142
01:32:08,837 --> 01:32:12,508
Have I just been told off?
I think I may have missed it.

1143
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,459
It's coming.

1144
01:32:14,635 --> 01:32:17,722
You are also
one of the biggest slobs in the world.

1145
01:32:17,763 --> 01:32:19,932
–Totally unreliable.
–Is that it?

1146
01:32:19,974 --> 01:32:22,977
–Undependable.
–Finished? Keep going, you're hot.

1147
01:32:23,019 --> 01:32:28,476
No, not keep going. You've been
told off. How do you like that?

1148
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:32,101
Because now,
I'm gonna tell you off.

1149
01:32:33,697 --> 01:32:38,201
For six months I've lived alone in this
apartment in eight big rooms.

1150
01:32:38,243 --> 01:32:42,372
I was dejected, despondent
and disgusted. Then you moved in.

1151
01:32:42,456 --> 01:32:45,208
My closest and dearest friend.

1152
01:32:45,376 --> 01:32:48,679
And after three weeks
of close personal contact,

1153
01:32:48,838 --> 01:32:51,542
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.

1154
01:32:51,716 --> 01:32:54,670
Do me a favour.
Move into the kitchen.

1155
01:32:54,844 --> 01:32:58,347
Live with your pots, pans, ladles,
your meat thermometers.

1156
01:32:58,389 --> 01:33:03,680
When you want to come out,
ring a bell and I'll run into the bedroom.

1157
01:33:03,853 --> 01:33:09,440
I'm asking you nicely, Felix,
as a friend, stay out of my way.

1158
01:33:12,529 --> 01:33:15,764
Walk on the paper.
I washed the floor in there.

1159
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:26,790
Stay away from me, Oscar.

1160
01:33:27,795 --> 01:33:29,953
Oscar stay away from me.

1161
01:33:30,965 --> 01:33:34,049
This is the day I'm gonna kill you.

1162
01:33:34,218 --> 01:33:36,425
Oscar. No, Oscar!

1163
01:33:45,939 --> 01:33:49,225
You hit me,
you get yourself one sweet lawsuit!

1164
01:33:49,401 --> 01:33:51,939
Those dogs should be on a leash.

1165
01:33:56,325 --> 01:34:00,592
–Can I speak to you calmly?
–First you bleed, then we'll talk.

1166
01:34:02,957 --> 01:34:06,293
I got you now, Felix.
There's no place for you to go but down.

1167
01:34:06,335 --> 01:34:08,921
If you want to fight,
let's go to the living room.

1168
01:34:08,963 --> 01:34:13,376
I don't want you in my living room,
bedroom, bathroom, kitchen,

1169
01:34:13,551 --> 01:34:16,422
or my building.
I don't want you at all.

1170
01:34:16,596 --> 01:34:20,183
–What are you talking about?
–It's over. We're getting an annulment.

1171
01:34:20,225 --> 01:34:23,311
Don't you understand?
I don't want to live with you.

1172
01:34:23,353 --> 01:34:26,731
Pack your things,
tie it in Saran wrap and get out.

1173
01:34:26,773 --> 01:34:30,527
–You mean actually move out?
–Actually, physically, immediately.

1174
01:34:30,569 --> 01:34:32,771
–This minute?
–Yes, this minute.

1175
01:34:32,863 --> 01:34:35,822
If you can do it sooner, I'd appreciate it.

1176
01:34:40,621 --> 01:34:43,167
I've got a good mind to really leave.

1177
01:34:45,501 --> 01:34:49,997
Why doesn't he hear me?
I know I'm talking. I recognise my voice.

1178
01:34:50,173 --> 01:34:53,340
Because, if you really
want me to go, I'll go.

1179
01:34:53,509 --> 01:34:57,175
I want you to go, so go!
When are you going?

1180
01:34:57,347 --> 01:35:01,048
Boy, you're in a bigger hurry
than Frances was.

1181
01:35:01,226 --> 01:35:05,355
Take as much time as she gave you.
Follow your usual routine.

1182
01:35:05,397 --> 01:35:07,649
In other words,
you're throwing me out?

1183
01:35:07,691 --> 01:35:10,736
Not in other words.
Those are the perfect ones.

1184
01:35:10,778 --> 01:35:15,664
I just wanted to get the record straight.
Let it be on your conscience.

1185
01:35:15,824 --> 01:35:18,150
Let what be on my conscience?

1186
01:35:18,327 --> 01:35:22,540
I'm perfectly willing to clear the air
of our differences, but you refuse.

1187
01:35:22,582 --> 01:35:26,544
I'm sick and tired of you clearing the air.
That's why I want you to leave.

1188
01:35:26,586 --> 01:35:31,299
But what happens to me is your
responsibility. Let it be on your head.

1189
01:35:31,341 --> 01:35:34,211
Let what be on my head?
Wait a minute.

1190
01:35:34,386 --> 01:35:37,597
Why can't you get thrown out
like a decent human being?

1191
01:35:37,639 --> 01:35:39,548
Let what be on my head?

1192
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:55,949
I'm leaving now,
according to your wishes and desires.

1193
01:35:56,117 --> 01:36:01,209
Either I'll come back and get the rest
of my clothes or someone else will.

1194
01:36:03,666 --> 01:36:05,742
You are not going any place

1195
01:36:05,919 --> 01:36:08,873
–until you take it back.
–Take what back?

1196
01:36:09,047 --> 01:36:12,217
“Let it be on your head.”
What the hell is that?

1197
01:36:12,258 --> 01:36:16,513
–“The Curse Of The Cat People?”
–I can't leave if you block the door.

1198
01:36:16,555 --> 01:36:20,809
Is this how you left Frances? No wonder
she wanted your room repainted.

1199
01:36:20,851 --> 01:36:23,603
I'm gonna have yours dipped in bronze.

1200
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:26,392
Would you get out of the way, please?

1201
01:36:51,424 --> 01:36:53,382
Where will you go?

1202
01:36:55,262 --> 01:36:57,301
Oh come on, Oscar.

1203
01:36:57,472 --> 01:37:00,088
You're not really interested, are you?

1204
01:37:03,187 --> 01:37:07,813
All right, you win.
We'll try to iron it out. Come back.

1205
01:37:07,983 --> 01:37:09,775
Felix!

1206
01:37:10,277 --> 01:37:13,729
Felix, come back!
Don't leave me like this.

1207
01:37:15,074 --> 01:37:19,787
I'm telling you, I'm worried. I know
Felix is going to try something crazy.

1208
01:37:19,829 --> 01:37:21,621
You threw him out?

1209
01:37:21,789 --> 01:37:25,085
I threw him out. I admit it.
Let it be on my head.

1210
01:37:25,126 --> 01:37:28,421
–Let what be on your head?
–Felix put it there, ask him.

1211
01:37:28,463 --> 01:37:30,090
He's out there somewhere.

1212
01:37:30,132 --> 01:37:32,342
He was driving us crazy
with his napkins and his ashtrays

1213
01:37:32,384 --> 01:37:35,220
and his bacon, lettuce and tomato
sandwiches. All of you said so.

1214
01:37:35,262 --> 01:37:36,722
We didn't say kick him out.

1215
01:37:36,763 --> 01:37:40,596
Who do you think I did it for?
I did it for us.

1216
01:37:40,768 --> 01:37:45,845
Do you know what he was planning for
Friday's game as a change of pace?

1217
01:37:46,023 --> 01:37:50,401
A Hawaiian luau!
Roast pork, fried rice, spareribs.

1218
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:52,738
They don't play poker
like that in Honolulu.

1219
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:55,575
–He's out there alone.
–Now I'm really worried.

1220
01:37:55,616 --> 01:37:58,661
Then why don't we stop worrying
and start looking?

1221
01:37:58,703 --> 01:38:01,662
How are we gonna find him?
It's a big city.

1222
01:38:01,664 --> 01:38:05,106
We'll look for a guy
with a suitcase who's crying.

1223
01:38:17,598 --> 01:38:20,184
They're not gonna like this
at the station.

1224
01:38:20,226 --> 01:38:23,062
You're not supposed to look for
a missing person with a missing car.

1225
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:27,101
Take it out of my taxes.
We'll try his apartment first.

1226
01:38:34,991 --> 01:38:39,412
Frances hasn't heard from him
since he called for her meatloaf recipe.

1227
01:38:39,454 --> 01:38:42,551
–Where to now?
–Cruise along Riverside Drive.

1228
01:38:42,582 --> 01:38:45,794
This is crazy, Oscar.
Why don't we call the cops?

1229
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:47,544
Drive the car.

1230
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,255
What are you doing, Murray?

1231
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:01,884
Off duty arrest.
Caught them gambling.

1232
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:12,647
We already combed the West Side.

1233
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:15,617
Why don't we go back
and wait to hear something?

1234
01:39:15,658 --> 01:39:17,702
I'm afraid we'll hear something.

1235
01:39:17,744 --> 01:39:20,413
–The poor guy.
–Will you stop saying that.

1236
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:23,250
What about me?
I got this lousy curse on my head.

1237
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:25,287
Let's go back. He'll show up.

1238
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:27,796
I know him.
He'll kill himself just to spite me.

1239
01:39:27,838 --> 01:39:32,380
Then his ghost will come back,
following me haunting and cleaning.

1240
01:39:35,429 --> 01:39:39,100
Come on, Oscar, play a few hands.
It'll take your mind off Felix.

1241
01:39:39,141 --> 01:39:41,763
Then stop mentioning his name.

1242
01:39:41,936 --> 01:39:45,106
I know what you're all thinking
but you're wrong.

1243
01:39:45,148 --> 01:39:47,021
It's his fault, not mine.

1244
01:39:47,191 --> 01:39:49,360
He never should have moved in here.

1245
01:39:49,402 --> 01:39:51,571
He should have stayed with Blanche.

1246
01:39:51,613 --> 01:39:53,855
–Why should he?
–She's his wife.

1247
01:39:54,032 --> 01:39:56,618
Blanche is your wife.
His wife is Frances.

1248
01:39:56,660 --> 01:40:00,914
Are you some kind of wise guy?
The game is over. Give me my cards.

1249
01:40:00,956 --> 01:40:03,750
–I don't want to play any more.
–We didn't even start.

1250
01:40:03,792 --> 01:40:07,046
I'm not gonna worry.
He's not worrying about me.

1251
01:40:07,087 --> 01:40:11,334
He's out in the streets,
sulking and having a wonderful time.

1252
01:40:11,509 --> 01:40:14,303
–I smell spaghetti.
–It's not spaghetti, it's linguini.

1253
01:40:14,345 --> 01:40:17,056
–Don't you care?
–I thought you weren't worried.

1254
01:40:17,098 --> 01:40:19,767
I'm not, dammit. I'm not worried.

1255
01:40:19,934 --> 01:40:22,893
–I'll bet that's him.
–I said he'd be back.

1256
01:40:23,021 --> 01:40:27,268
Vinnie, open the door.
Play like nothing happened. Just deal.

1257
01:40:28,693 --> 01:40:30,485
OK, open the door.

1258
01:40:33,824 --> 01:40:36,575
–Hello.
–How do you do?

1259
01:40:36,743 --> 01:40:38,819
Hello there, Cecily.

1260
01:40:38,996 --> 01:40:43,667
Gwendolyn. Please, don't stand up.
May I see you a moment, Mr Madison?

1261
01:40:43,709 --> 01:40:48,418
Certainly, Gwendolyn.
What's the matter?

1262
01:40:50,591 --> 01:40:54,671
I think you know.
I've come for Felix's things.

1263
01:41:03,188 --> 01:41:06,189
–You mean my Felix?
–Yes, Felix Ungar.

1264
01:41:06,358 --> 01:41:11,779
That sweet man who's in my flat
pouring his heart out to my sister.

1265
01:41:13,115 --> 01:41:17,444
Gwen, Felix doesn't want to stay.
Please tell him to stay.

1266
01:41:17,619 --> 01:41:20,706
Please, this is embarrassing.
I can go to a hotel.

1267
01:41:20,748 --> 01:41:24,501
–There's plenty of room on the sofa.
–I'll be in the way.

1268
01:41:24,543 --> 01:41:27,213
How could you possibly
be in anyone's way?

1269
01:41:27,254 --> 01:41:30,591
–You want to see a typewritten list?
–You've said enough.

1270
01:41:30,633 --> 01:41:34,583
–Please just for a few days.
–Until you get settled.

1271
01:41:34,762 --> 01:41:39,923
–Please, we'd be so happy.
–Maybe just for a few days.

1272
01:41:40,101 --> 01:41:43,271
–That's marvellous!
–Get the rest of your things.

1273
01:41:43,313 --> 01:41:45,607
–We'll clean the house.
–And cook dinner.

1274
01:41:45,649 --> 01:41:49,069
It'll be so nice to have a man
about the house again.

1275
01:41:49,111 --> 01:41:52,322
Good night, gentlemen.
Sorry to interrupt your bridge game.

1276
01:41:52,364 --> 01:41:54,273
–Ta ta.
–Ta ta.

1277
01:42:14,596 --> 01:42:17,849
What did I tell you?
It's always the quiet guys.

1278
01:42:17,891 --> 01:42:20,097
What nice girls.

1279
01:42:27,442 --> 01:42:30,487
Felix, are you really gonna move
in with them?

1280
01:42:30,529 --> 01:42:33,574
Just for a couple of days
until I get my own pad.

1281
01:42:33,615 --> 01:42:36,819
–Aren't you going to thank me?
–For what?

1282
01:42:36,994 --> 01:42:41,582
The two greatest things I've done for you.
Taking you in and throwing you out.

1283
01:42:41,624 --> 01:42:45,169
You're right. Getting thrown
out twice is enough for any man.

1284
01:42:45,211 --> 01:42:47,380
In gratitude, I remove the curse.

1285
01:42:47,421 --> 01:42:50,508
Bless you and thank you,
Wicked Witch of the North.

1286
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:53,595
Probably the girls.
They hate it when I'm late for cocktails.

1287
01:42:53,636 --> 01:42:55,629
It's your wife.

1288
01:42:58,141 --> 01:43:01,770
Do me a favour.
Tell her I can't talk to her right now.

1289
01:43:01,812 --> 01:43:05,857
I'll call her in a couple of days
because we have a lot to talk about.

1290
01:43:05,899 --> 01:43:07,643
And if I sound different,

1291
01:43:07,818 --> 01:43:11,989
it's because I'm not the same man
she threw out three weeks ago.

1292
01:43:12,031 --> 01:43:15,530
I will when I see her.
This is Oscar's wife.

1293
01:43:20,498 --> 01:43:21,992
Hello, Blanche.

1294
01:43:22,166 --> 01:43:23,876
I got a pretty good idea
why you're calling.

1295
01:43:23,918 --> 01:43:26,879
You got my cheques, right?
So now we're even.

1296
01:43:26,921 --> 01:43:29,875
No, I haven't been winning at the track.

1297
01:43:30,049 --> 01:43:34,637
I've just been eating home a lot lately.
You don't have to thank me.

1298
01:43:34,679 --> 01:43:38,433
I'm just doing what's right.
That's very nice of you too.

1299
01:43:38,475 --> 01:43:40,183
Good night, Mr Madison.

1300
01:43:40,352 --> 01:43:44,022
If you need any heavy cleaning,
I get a dollar and a half an hour.

1301
01:43:44,064 --> 01:43:45,772
Yeah, OK.

1302
01:43:45,941 --> 01:43:50,759
Talk to you tomorrow night.
Kiss the kids for me. Good night, Blanche.

1303
01:43:50,779 --> 01:43:54,860
What about next Friday?
You're not gonna break up the game?

1304
01:43:55,034 --> 01:43:58,371
Never. Marriage may come and go,
but the game must go on.

1305
01:43:58,412 --> 01:44:00,868
So long, Frances.

1306
01:44:01,999 --> 01:44:03,659
So long, Blanche.

1307
01:44:06,546 --> 01:44:10,295
What are we gonna do?
Sit around or play poker?

1308
01:44:10,467 --> 01:44:12,044
Let's play.

1309
01:44:13,303 --> 01:44:19,092
Boys, let's watch the cigarette butts.
This is my house, not a pig sty.

1310
01:44:22,187 --> 01:44:24,180
Ante a quarter, fellas.
