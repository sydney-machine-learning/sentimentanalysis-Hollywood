1
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,500
Two households,
both alike in dignity,

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,000
in fair Verona
where we lay our scene,

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,000
from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

4
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,500
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,800
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,500
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life,

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,000
whose misadventured
piteous overthrows

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
do with their death...
bury their parents'strife.

9
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,000
But the quarrel is between
our masters and us their men.

10
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,300
Ah, 'tis all one.

11
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,300
Here come the house
of the Montagues.

12
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,500
Ah, good morrow.

13
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,400
Good morrow
to you, sir.

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,500
Quarrel,
I will back thee.

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,000
Right.

16
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,700
Fail me not.

17
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,000
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I do bite
my thumb, sir.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,500
No, sir.

21
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
I do not bite my
thumb at you, sir,

22
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,000
but I do bite
my thumb, sir.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,500
Do you quarrel, sir?

24
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,000
Quarrel, sir?
No, no, no, sir.

25
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,500
If you do, sir,
I am for you.

26
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,500
I serve as good
a man as you.

27
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,500
No better?

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,800
Yes, better, sir.

29
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,000
You lie.

30
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,000
Draw!

31
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,700
Draw if you be men!

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,600
Gregory, remember
thy swashing blow!

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Kill the Capulets!

34
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,000
Part, fools!
Put up your swords!

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You know not what you do!

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The Prince hath
expressly forbid

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,100
this bandying
in Verona streets!

38
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,000
Here come the Capulets!

39
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,500
Tybalt, Capulet's kinsman!

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,900
What, art thou drawn among
these heartless hinds?

41
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,500
Turn thee, Benvolio.
Look upon thy death.

42
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,000
I do but keep the peace.

43
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,500
Put up thy sword

44
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,900
or manage it
to part these men with me.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,700
What, drawn
and talk of peace?

46
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
I hate the word,

47
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,700
as I hate hell,
all Montagues and thee.

48
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,300
Have at thee, cowards!

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,100
Capulet!

50
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,500
Montague!

51
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,000
Capulet!

52
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,700
Now hie thee home,
fragment.

53
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,100
You villain!

54
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,500
Capulet!

55
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,100
Give me my long sword! Ho!

56
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,500
Capulet!

57
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
Down to the market square!

58
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,000
Capulet!

59
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,800
Follow me! Follow me!

60
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,500
Kill that villain Montague!

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,900
My noble uncle!
My noble uncle!

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,700
What?

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,900
My sword! My sword!

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,900
Thou shalt not stir
a foot to seek a foe!

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,900
Hold me not!
Let me go!

66
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Montague!

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
Montague!

68
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,000
Kill the villain!

69
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I'll strike thee, coward.

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
The Prince!

71
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,900
The Prince is coming!
Put down your weapons!

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,200
The Prince!

73
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,400
The Prince!

74
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,100
Here comes the Prince!

75
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,300
Put your weapons down!
The Prince!

76
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,400
Rebellious subjects,
enemies to peace,

77
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,000
throw your mistempered
weapons to the ground...

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Down with your weapons.

79
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,300
And hear the sentence
of your moved Prince.

80
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,000
Three civil brawls
bred of an airy word,

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,500
by thee, old Capulet...

82
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,200
No, no.

83
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,100
And Montague...

84
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,400
Have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

85
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,900
If ever you disturb
our streets again,

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,900
your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,400
For this time
all the rest depart away!

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,500
You, Capulet,
shall go along with me.

89
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,000
And, Montague,
come you this afternoon.

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,400
Once more, on pain of death,
all men depart.

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Where is Romeo?
Saw you him today?

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,500
Right glad I am
he was not at this fray.

93
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,900
Madam, an hour before
the worshipped sun

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,500
peered forth
the golden window of the east,

95
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,900
a troubled mind drove me
to walk abroad:

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
where, underneath
the grove of sycamore

97
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,600
so early walking
did I see your son.

98
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,400
Towards him I made;
but he was ware of me,

99
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,400
and stole into
the cover of the wood.

100
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,400
Many a morning hath
he there been seen.

101
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,400
See, where he comes.

102
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,500
So please you, step aside.

103
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I would thou wert
so happy by thy stay,

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,500
to hear true shrift.

106
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,000
Come, madam. Let's away.

107
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,900
Good morrow, cousin.

108
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Is the day so young?

109
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,600
But new struck nine.

110
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,900
Ay me!

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,500
Sad hours seem long.

112
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,000
Was that my father
that went hence so fast?

113
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
It was.

114
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,100
What sadness lengthens
Romeo's hours?

115
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,100
Not having that, which having
makes them short.

116
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,300
Hmm. Hmm!

117
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,000
But, Romeo...

118
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Farewell, Coz.

119
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,500
God's me,
what fray was here?

120
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
Yet tell me not,

121
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,000
for I have heard it all.

122
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,500
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

123
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,300
Soft, I will go along.

124
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,000
But Montague is bound
as well as l,

125
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,000
in penalty alike,

126
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
and 'tis not hard, I think,

127
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,500
for men as old as we
to keep the peace.

128
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Oh...

129
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,000
Of honorable reckoning
are you both,

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,500
and pity 'tis you
lived at odds so long:

131
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,500
but, but now, my lord,

132
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
what say you to my suit?

133
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,500
But saying o'er what
I have said before,

134
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,700
my child is yet
a stranger in the world.

135
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,500
She hath not seen the change
of fourteen years.

136
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,000
Let two more summers
wither in their pride,

137
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,900
'ere we may think her
ripe to be a bride.

138
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,700
Younger than she
are happy mothers made.

139
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,500
And too soon marred
are those so early made.

140
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,500
The earth hath swallowed
all my hopes but she,

141
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,500
she is the hopeful lady
of my earth.

142
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,000
But woo her, gentle
Paris, get her heart,

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,500
my will to her consent
is but a part.

144
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh, Peter!

145
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,500
This night I hold
an old accustomed feast

146
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,000
whereto I have invited
many a guest.

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Such as I love,
you among the store,

148
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
one more, most welcome,
makes my number more.

149
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,800
Nurse,
where's my daughter?

150
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,000
Call her forth to me.

151
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,000
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,

152
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,500
I bade her come.

153
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,000
Where is the girl?
Juliet! Juliet!

154
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,200
Where is the girl?
Juliet!

155
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,500
Where is the girl? Juliet!

156
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,000
How now, who calls?

157
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,100
Your mother!
Your lady mother!

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Juliet, it's your mother,
your lady mother.

159
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Make haste, girl.
Make haste.

160
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,800
Where were you?

161
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

162
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,500
This is the matter.

163
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,000
Make haste, girls.
Come on, come on.

164
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,100
Nurse, um...

165
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,900
give leave awhile,
we must talk in secret.

166
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,500
Nurse, come back again.
I have remembered me.

167
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Thou's hear our counsel.

168
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,000
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

169
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,000
I can tell her age
unto an hour.

170
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,400
She's not fourteen.

171
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,400
I'll lay fourteen
of my teeth.

172
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,400
And yet to
my teen be it spoke,

173
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,400
I have but four,
she's not fourteen.

174
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,100
How long is it
to Lammastide?

175
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,900
A fortnight and odd days.

176
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,300
Even or odd, of all
the days of the year,

177
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,300
come Lammas Eve at night
shall she be fourteen.

178
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
Susan and she--

179
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,300
God rest all Christian
souls were of an age.

180
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,800
Well, Susan is with God.
She was too good for me.

181
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,700
But, as I said,
on Lammas Eve

182
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,900
at night
shall she be fourteen.

183
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,100
That shall she, marry!
I remember it well.

184
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,800
My lord and you
were then at Mantua!

185
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,400
Nay, I do bear a brain.

186
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,900
For then she could,
she could stand high lone.

187
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Nay, by the road she could have
run and waddled all about,

188
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,900
for even the day before
she broke her brow;

189
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,800
and then my husband-- God rest his soul,
'a were a merry man--

190
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,300
took up the child.

191
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,900
"Yea," quoth he,
"dost thou fall upon thy face?

192
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,800
"Thou wilt fall backward
when thou hast more wit;

193
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
wilt thou not, Jule?"

194
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Nurse!

195
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,400
And by my holiday,

196
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,900
the pretty wretch left
crying and said, "Ay."

197
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,900
Enough of this,
I pray thee hold thy peace.

198
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,500
Yes, madam.

199
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Now, Juliet.

200
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,300
God mark thee to His grace

201
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,800
Thou was the prettiest babe
that 'er I nurs'd.

202
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
And I might live to see
thee married once,

203
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,800
I have my wish.

204
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:20,300
Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
I came to talk of.

205
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,600
Tell me,
daughter Juliet,

206
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,800
how stands your disposition
to be married?

207
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,900
It is an honor
that I dream not of.

208
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,400
An honor, were I not
thy only nurse,

209
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,300
I would say thou hadst sucked
wisdom from my teat.

210
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,900
Well, think
of marriage now.

211
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,900
Younger than you, here in Verona,
ladies of esteem,

212
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,400
are made
already mothers.

213
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,900
By my count
I was your mother

214
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,900
much upon these years
that you are now a maid.

215
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,400
Oh, yes, I remember.

216
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,200
Thus then, in brief...

217
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,200
the valiant Paris
seeks you for his love.

218
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,300
A man, young lady!
Lady, such as all the world--

219
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,300
Why he's a man of wax.

220
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,300
Verona's summer hath
not such a flower.

221
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,300
Nay, he's
a flower in faith.

222
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,800
What say you?
Can you love the gentleman?

223
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,200
Madam! Madam!

224
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,300
The guests have come,
supper serv'd up,

225
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,500
you call'd,
my young lady ask'd for!

226
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,800
We follow.

227
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Speak briefly,
can you like of Paris' love?

228
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:37,400
I'll look to like,
if looking liking move.

229
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,900
But no more deep
will I endart mine eye,

230
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,900
than your consent gives
strength to make it fly.

231
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Juliet, the county stays.

232
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,900
Madam, I come.

233
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Go, girl, seek happy nights
for happy days.

234
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,100
Give me a case
to put my visage in;

235
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100
a visor for a visor.

236
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,800
What care I what curious eye
doth quote deformities.

237
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,300
Here are the beetle-brows
shall blush for me.

238
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
What, shall this speech
be spoke for our excuse?

239
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
Or shall we on
without apology?

240
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
The date is out
of such prolixity.

241
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,100
Let them measure us
by what they will.

242
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,400
We'll measure them
a measure and be gone.

243
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Come, knock and enter,
and no sooner in,

244
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,200
but every man
betake him to his legs.

245
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,900
And we mean well in
going to this masque,

246
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,300
but 'tis no wit to go.

247
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,100
Why, may one ask?

248
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,300
I dreamt a dream tonight.

249
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,100
Ho, and so did I.

250
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,700
Well, what was yours?

251
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,100
That dreamers often lie.

252
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,800
In bed asleep while they
do dream things true.

253
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,400
Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.

254
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,100
Queen Mab?

255
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,700
She is...She is
the fairies' midwife.

256
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
And she comes in state

257
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,300
no bigger than
an agate stone

258
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,300
on the forefinger
of an alderman,

259
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,600
drawn with a team
of little atomies

260
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,900
athwart men's noses
as they lie asleep.

261
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,900
Her wagon spokes are made
of long spinner's legs;

262
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,400
and the cover,
of the wings of grasshoppers;

263
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,900
the traces
of the smallest spider's web;

264
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:03,800
and the collars, mmm,
of the moonshine's watery beams;

265
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,300
her whip, crack!

266
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Is a cricket's bone;
the lash of film;

267
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,800
and in this state

268
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,500
she gallops night by night
through lovers' brains,

269
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,000
and then they dream of love,

270
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,500
o'er ladies' lips,
who straight on kisses dream,

271
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,000
which oft the angry Mab
with blisters plagues,

272
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,000
because their breaths
with, er,

273
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,500
sweetmeats tainted are.

274
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,000
Snd sometime comes she
with a tithe-pig's tail,

275
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,000
tickling the parson's nose
as he lies asleep,

276
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,200
and dreams he
of another benefice.

277
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,000
Amen.

278
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,400
Sometimes she driveth
o'er a soldier's neck,

279
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,900
and then dreams he

280
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,400
of cutting foreign throats,
of breaches,

281
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
ambuscadoes, spanish blades,
drums in his ear,

282
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,100
at which he starts and wakes;

283
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,600
and being thus frighted
tries a prayer or two...

284
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,100
and sleeps again.

285
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
This is that very Mab

286
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,100
that plaits the manes
of horses in the night,

287
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,100
and bakes the elf-locks
in foul sluttish hairs,

288
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,700
which once untangled
much misfortune bodes.

289
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,100
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs,

290
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,600
that presses them
and learns them first to bear

291
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,100
making them women
of good carriage.

292
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,900
This is she...

293
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,100
This is she that...

294
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,900
This...is she.

295
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
Peace, Mercutio, peace.

296
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,100
Thou talk'st of nothing.

297
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,600
Thou talk'st of nothing.

298
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,800
True.

299
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,100
True, I talk of dreams;

300
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,100
which are the children
of an idle brain...

301
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,100
Begot of nothing
but vain fantasy;

302
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,600
which is as thin
of substance as the air,

303
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
and more inconstant
than the wind

304
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,100
who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north,

305
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,100
and being angered
puffs away from thence,

306
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,100
turning his side
to the dew-dropping south.

307
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,600
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves.

308
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,600
Strike drum.
Come, lusty gentlemen.

309
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,000
Romeo, we shall
arrive too late.

310
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,500
I fear too early...

311
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,600
For my mind misgives...

312
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,100
Some consequence,
yet hanging in the stars,

313
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,100
shall bitterly begin
his fearful date

314
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,600
with this night's revels,

315
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,600
and expire the term
of a despised life

316
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
closed in my breast,

317
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,600
by some vile forfeit
of untimely death.

318
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,100
But he that hath
the steerage of my course...

319
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,100
Direct my sail.

320
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,100
Enter my poor house.
Vido, vido, welcome.

321
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,100
Oh, my lovely Helena,
my lovely niece.

322
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Welcome all!
Be merry, gentlemen.

323
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,000
Be lively, ladies.
Ahoy! Ahoy!

324
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,500
Welcome, gentlemen.

325
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,000
I have seen the day
that I have worn a visor

326
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,500
and could tell a whispering tale
in a fair lady's ear,

327
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,100
such as would please.

328
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,100
'Tis gone, 'tis gone.
You are welcome, gentlemen.

329
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Ladies, ho, ho!

330
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
She doth teach the torches
to burn bright.

331
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,800
It seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night

332
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,000
as a rich jewel
in an Ethiop's ear;,

333
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,600
beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

334
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,100
So shows a snowy dove
trooping with crows,

335
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,700
as yonder lady
o'er her fellow shows.

336
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,900
Did my heart love till now?

337
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,500
Forswear it sight,

338
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,900
for I ne'er saw true beauty
till this night.

339
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,800
This by his voice
should be a Montague.

340
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,500
Uncle, this is
a Montague, our foe;

341
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,500
a villain that is
hither come in spite,

342
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,500
to scorn at
our solemnity this night.

343
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,100
Young Romeo is it?

344
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,500
Dares the slave come hither
covered in an antic face,

345
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,400
to fear and scorn
at our solemnity?

346
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,500
'A bears him like
a courtly gentleman;

347
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,500
and to say truth,
Verona brags of him

348
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,500
to be a virtuous
and well managed youth.

349
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,500
I would not for the wealth
of all this town

350
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,500
here in my house
do him disparagement.

351
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,900
Therefore have patience,
take no note of him.

352
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,500
The Moureska!

353
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,000
The Moureska!

354
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Why, Uncle,
'tis a shame!

355
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,000
Go to.

356
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,500
You are a saucy boy.

357
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,000
You'll make a mutiny
among my guests!

358
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,500
Am I the master here,
or you?

359
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,000
I will not endure him.

360
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,200
You will not endure!
He shall be endured!

361
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,700
Or I know what!

362
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Well said, my hearts.

363
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,500
You're a princox.

364
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,700
Be quiet or...

365
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,500
For shame!
I'll make you quiet.

366
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,100
Leonardo will sing!

367
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,700
Leonardo, I pray thee, sing.

368
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,300
What is a youth?

369
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,100
Impetuous fire

370
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,100
What is a maid?

371
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,400
Ice and desire

372
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,900
The world wags on

373
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,400
A rose will bloom

374
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,800
It then will fade

375
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:44,300
So does a youth

376
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:53,300
So does the fairest maid

377
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,600
Comes the time

378
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,100
When one sweet smile

379
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,600
Has its season for a while

380
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:09,500
Then love's in love with me

381
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,400
Some may think only to marry

382
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,000
Others will tease and tarry

383
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,400
Mine is the very best parry

384
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,200
Cupid he rules us all

385
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,800
Caper the caper,
sing me the song

386
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,300
Death will come soon
to hush us along

387
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,800
Sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall

388
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,500
Love is a pastime
that never will pall

389
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall

390
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,400
Cupid he rules us all

391
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,000
A rose will bloom

392
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,100
And then will fade

393
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:23,000
So does a youth

394
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:32,700
So does the fairest maid

395
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,500
If I profane
with my unworthiest hand

396
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,000
this holy shrine,

397
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,200
the gentle sin is this;

398
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:50,400
my lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand

399
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:57,300
to smooth the rough touch
with a gentle kiss.

400
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:20,000
Good pilgrim, you do wrong
your hand too much

401
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,000
which mannerly devotion
shows in this;

402
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:28,500
for saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch

403
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,500
and palm to palm is
holy palmers' kiss.

404
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,500
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

405
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,500
Ay, pilgrim, lips that
they must use in prayer.

406
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,000
O then, dear saint,

407
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,500
let lips do
what hands do...

408
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,000
They pray,
grant thou,

409
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,500
lest faith
turn to despair.

410
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Saints do not move,

411
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
though grants
for prayers' sake.

412
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Then move not...

413
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,500
While my prayer's
effect I take.

414
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:27,000
Thus from my lips,
by thine,

415
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,700
my sin is purged.

416
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,500
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.

417
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,500
Sin from my lips!

418
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,500
O trespass sweetly urged!

419
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,500
Give me my sin again.

420
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,000
A rose will bloom

421
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,300
It then will fade

422
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:07,400
So does a youth

423
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:20,400
So does the fairest maid

424
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,500
Juliet!

425
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,200
Lady Juliet!

426
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,900
Nurse?

427
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,700
Your mother craves
a word with you.

428
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,200
Make haste, make haste!

429
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,500
What is her mother?

430
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,000
Hmm.
Merry, bachelor,

431
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,000
her mother is
the lady of the house,

432
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,000
and a good lady,
and wise, and virtuous;

433
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,500
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

434
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,500
I tell you he that
shall lay hold of her

435
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,000
shall have the chinks.

436
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,500
Is she a Capulet?

437
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,000
Ah, dear account!

438
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,300
My life is my foe's debt.

439
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,200
What, ho, my mistresses?

440
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,000
What, will you be gone?

441
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,500
It seems so, poor God,
it is so very late.

442
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,800
We'll call it early,
by and by.

443
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,100
Good night,
sweet, my Lady Juliet.

444
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,500
Come hither, nurse.

445
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,100
What is yon gentleman?

446
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,500
Count Paris.

447
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,100
No. What's he
that follows there?

448
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,900
Oh! I know not.

449
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Go, ask his name.

450
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Hmm. Romeo, of
the house of Montague.

451
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,100
What?

452
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,100
His name is Romeo,
and a Montague;

453
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,800
the only son of
your great enemy.

454
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,500
My only love sprung
from my only hate,

455
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,500
too early seen unknown,
and known too late!

456
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,000
Prodigious birth of love
it is to me

457
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,900
that I must love
a loathed enemy.

458
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,000
Juliet!

459
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,500
My Lady Juliet!

460
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,000
Madam!

461
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,300
Romeo!

462
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,100
Juliet!

463
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,000
Romeo!

464
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,600
Lady Juliet!

465
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,500
Juliet!

466
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,600
Romeo!

467
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,000
Romeo!

468
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Romeo!

469
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Romeo!

470
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,500
Romeo!

471
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,100
Romeo!

472
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,500
Romeo!

473
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,500
Romeo!

474
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,000
1, 2, 3.

475
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,500
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

476
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,000
He is wise,

477
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,200
and on my life hath
stolen him home to bed.

478
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,500
He leaped
this orchard wall.

479
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,700
Call, good Mercutio.

480
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,000
Romeo!

481
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,200
Romeo! Passion! Lover!

482
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,800
O-hooo! Madman!

483
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,200
O-hooo! Romeo!

484
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,300
He heareth not,
he stirreth not, he moveth not.

485
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,900
The ape is dead.

486
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,800
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.

487
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,500
Romeo, it's all right.

488
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,400
But soft,

489
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,600
what light through
yonder window breaks?

490
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,300
It is my lady,

491
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,400
oh, it is my love.

492
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,900
O that she knew she were.

493
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,400
She speaks,
yet she says nothing.

494
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,600
What of that?

495
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,900
Her eye discourses,
I will answer it.

496
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,900
I am too bold,

497
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,900
'tis not to me she speaks.

498
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,400
Two of the fairest stars
in all the heavens,

499
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,900
having some business,
do entreat her eyes

500
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,900
to twinkle in their spheres
till they return.

501
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

502
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,500
Oh, that I were
a glove upon that hand,

503
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,100
that I might touch
that cheek.

504
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,700
Ay me!

505
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
She speaks.

506
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,600
Oh, speak again,
bright angel.

507
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,400
O Romeo, Romeo,

508
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,900
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

509
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,000
Deny thy father,
and refuse thy name.

510
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,000
Or if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

511
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,400
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

512
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,900
Shall I hear more,

513
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,900
or shall I speak at this?

514
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,900
'Tis but thy name
that is my enemy.

515
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,700
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.

516
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,000
What is Montague?

517
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:49,000
It is nor hand nor foot,
nor arm nor face

518
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,900
nor any other part
belonging to a man.

519
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,100
O be some other name.

520
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,100
What's in a name?

521
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,600
That which we call a rose

522
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,700
by any other name
would smell as sweet;

523
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,300
so Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called,

524
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,900
retain that dear perfection

525
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,900
which he owes
without that title.

526
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,400
Romeo, doff thy name,

527
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,400
and for that name
which is no part of thee,

528
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,500
take all myself.

529
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,600
I'll take thee
at thy word.

530
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Call me but love,
and I'll be new baptized;

531
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,900
henceforth I never
will be Romeo.

532
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,400
What man art thou,
that thus bescreened in night

533
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,100
so stumblest
on my counsel?

534
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,000
By a name I know not how to
tell thee who I am.

535
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,900
My name, dear saint,
is hateful to myself,

536
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,300
because it is
an enemy to thee.

537
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,200
Had I it written,
I would tear the word.

538
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,400
My ears have not yet drunk

539
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,400
a hundred words
of that tongue's utterance,

540
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,400
yet I know the sound.

541
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,500
Art thou not Romeo,
and a Montague?

542
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,000
Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.

543
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,800
How cam'st thou hither,
tell me and wherefore?

544
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,300
The orchard walls are
high and hard to climb,

545
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,700
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

546
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,300
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

547
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,900
With love's light wings

548
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,900
did I o'er perch
these walls,

549
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,400
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,

550
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,400
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

551
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,200
Therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me.

552
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,400
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee.

553
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,900
I have night's cloak to
hide me from their eyes.

554
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,900
And but thou love me...

555
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,700
Let them find me here

556
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,700
my life were better
ended by their hate,

557
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,100
than death prorogued,
wanting of thy love.

558
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,900
Dost thou love me?

559
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,100
I know thou wilt say ay,
and I will take thy word;

560
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,600
yet if thou swearest,

561
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,000
thou mayst prove false;

562
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:05,500
at lovers' perjuries
they say jove laughs.

563
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,800
O gentle Romeo,

564
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:13,000
if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

565
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,800
Or if thou thinkest
I am too quickly won,

566
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,400
I'll frown and be perverse,
and say thee nay,

567
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,800
so thou wilt woo
but else not for the world.

568
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,000
In truth, fair Montague,
I am too fond...

569
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,500
And therefore thou mayst think
my haviour light.

570
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,700
No.

571
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,500
But trust me, gentleman,
I'll prove more true

572
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,600
than those that have
more cunning to be strange.

573
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,000
I should have been
more strange,

574
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,500
I must confess,

575
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,500
but that thou overheard'st,
ere I was ware,

576
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,000
my true love's passion;

577
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,000
therefore pardon me,

578
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,000
and not impute this yielding
to light love,

579
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,900
which the dark night
hath so discovered.

580
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,500
Lady, by yonder
blessed moon, I swear.

581
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,500
Oh, swear not by the moon,

582
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,000
th'inconstant moon,

583
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,500
that monthly changes
in her circled orb,

584
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,600
lest that thy love prove
likewise variable.

585
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,100
What shall I swear by?

586
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,100
Do not swear at all.

587
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,500
Or if thou wilt...

588
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,500
Swear by thy gracious self,

589
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,500
which is the god
of my idolatry,

590
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,000
and I'll believe thee.

591
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:39,100
If my heart's dear love,
I swear...

592
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, Juliet!

593
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,500
Sweet, good night.

594
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,000
This bud of love
by summer's ripening breath

595
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,000
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

596
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,200
Good night, good night.

597
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,700
As sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart

598
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,700
as that
within my breast.

599
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,100
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

600
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,900
What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

601
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,800
Th' exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

602
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,000
I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it.

603
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,800
And yet I would it were
to give again.

604
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,500
Wouldst thou
withdraw it?

605
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,800
For what purpose, love?

606
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,800
But to be frank
and give it thee again.

607
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:22,500
And yet I wish
but for the thing I have,

608
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,500
my bounty is
as boundless as the sea,

609
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,000
my love as deep.

610
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,000
The more I give to thee,
the more I have,

611
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,000
for both are infinite.

612
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,500
Juliet!

613
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,000
Anon, good nurse!

614
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,500
Sweet Montague, be true.

615
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,000
Madam!

616
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,000
Stay but a little,
I will come again.

617
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,500
Madam! Lady Juliet!

618
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,200
O blessed, blessed night!

619
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,800
Oh! I am afeard,
being in night,

620
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,000
all this is but a dream,

621
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,500
too flattering-sweet
to be substantial.

622
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

623
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,500
If that thy bent of love
be honorable,

624
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,000
thy purpose marriage,
send me word tomorrow,

625
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,500
by one that I'll procure
to come to thee.

626
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,500
Where and what time
thou wilt perform the rite,

627
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,000
and all my fortunes
at thy foot I'll lay

628
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,700
and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

629
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,000
Madam!

630
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,100
I come, anon.

631
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,500
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee--

632
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,700
Lady Juliet!

633
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,000
By and by I come!

634
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,200
To cease thy suit
and leave me to my grief.

635
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,700
Tomorrow will I send.

636
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,400
So thrive my soul.

637
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,100
A thousand times
good night!

638
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,500
Romeo!

639
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,300
At what o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

640
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,500
At the hour of nine.

641
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,500
I will not fail.

642
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,800
'Tis twenty years
till then.

643
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,100
Romeo!

644
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,000
I have forgot
why I did call thee back.

645
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,500
Let me stand here
till thou remember it.

646
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,100
I shall forget, to have
thee still stand there,

647
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,300
remembering how
I love thy company.

648
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,800
And I'll still stay,

649
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,800
to have thee
still forget,

650
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,800
forgetting
any other home but this.

651
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,900
Good night, good night!

652
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,500
Parting is
such sweet sorrow

653
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,700
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

654
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,200
Friar Laurence!

655
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,000
What early tongue
so sweet saluteth me?

656
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,000
Good morrow, father!

657
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,300
Young son, it argues
a distempered head

658
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,800
so soon to bid
good morrow to thy bed.

659
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,900
Therefore thy earliness
doth me assure

660
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,900
thou art uproused with
some distemperature.

661
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,400
Or if not so,
then here I put it right

662
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,900
our Romeo hath not
been in bed tonight.

663
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,100
The last is true.
The sweeter rest was mine.

664
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,400
God pardon sin!
Wast thou with Rosaline?

665
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,900
With Rosaline,
my ghostly father, no.

666
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,900
I have forgot that name
and that name's woe.

667
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,400
That's my good son.

668
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,400
Well, where hast
thou been then?

669
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,900
I'll tell thee ere
thou ask it me again.

670
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,400
I have been feasting
with mine enemy,

671
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,800
where on a sudden
one hath wounded me.

672
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,900
Be plain, good son,
and homely in thy drift.

673
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,000
Riddling confession finds
but riddling shrift.

674
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,900
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set,

675
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,400
on the fair daughter
of rich Capulet.

676
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,900
As mine on hers,
so hers is set on mine,

677
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,400
and all combined,
save what thou must combine

678
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,400
by holy marriage.

679
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,400
When and where,
and how we met,

680
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,900
we woo'd, and made
exchange of vow,

681
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,300
I'll tell thee as we pass.

682
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,900
But this I pray,

683
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,200
that thou consent
to marry us today.

684
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,400
Hmmm?

685
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,600
Holy Saint Francis!

686
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,900
Is Rosaline,
that thou didst love so dear,

687
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,400
so soon forsaken?

688
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,400
Thou doest not mock me, Father!

689
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,400
Young men's love then lies
not truly in their hearts,

690
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,900
but in their eyes.

691
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,400
Hear me, Father.

692
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,400
Jesu Maria!
What a deal of brine

693
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,900
hath washed thy sallow cheeks
for Rosaline!

694
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,400
And art thou changed?

695
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,900
Pronounce this
sentence then.

696
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,900
Women may fall when
there's no strength in men.

697
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,400
Thou chidst me oft
for loving Rosaline.

698
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,400
Doting, not for loving,
pupil mine.

699
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,600
Yes, for loving and,
and badest me bury love.

700
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,600
Not in a grave
to lay one in,

701
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,200
another out to have.

702
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,900
Come, young waverer,

703
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,400
come, go with me.

704
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,400
In one respect
I'll thy assistant be.

705
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,900
O Father!

706
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,900
For this alliance
may so happy prove

707
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,400
to turn your households'
rancor to pure love.

708
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,900
O, let us hence!

709
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,900
I stand on sudden haste.

710
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,400
Shh! Wisely and slow,

711
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,400
they stumble
that run fast.

712
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,900
Where the devil
should this Romeo be?

713
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,800
Came he not home tonight?

714
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,800
Huh?

715
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,800
Came he not home tonight?

716
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,800
Who?

717
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,000
Romeo.

718
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,800
O no, not to his father's.
I spoke with his man.

719
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,400
Hey, Tybalt, the kinsman
to old Capulet,

720
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,400
hath sent a letter
to his father's house.

721
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,900
A challenge, on my life.

722
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,400
Romeo will answer it.

723
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,400
Any man that can write
may answer a letter.

724
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,400
Nay, he will answer
the letter's master,

725
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,400
how he dares,
being dared.

726
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,900
Alas, poor Romeo,
he is already dead;

727
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,400
stabbed with
a white wench's black eye;

728
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,400
run through the ear
with a love song;

729
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,400
the very pin
of his heart cleft

730
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,400
with the blind
bow-boy's buttshaft.

731
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,400
And is he a man
to encounter Tybalt?

732
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,300
Why, what is Tybalt!

733
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,100
More than Prince of Cats,
I can tell you.

734
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,200
Ah, good morrow
to you both.

735
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,800
That we should be
thus afflicted

736
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,300
with these
strange flies,

737
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,400
these fashionmongers,

738
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,900
these pardonnez moi's.

739
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,400
Ah, Signor Romeo,

740
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,900
Bonjour.

741
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,400
Bonjour.

742
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,900
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

743
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,900
You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.

744
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,900
What counterfeit
did I give you?

745
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,900
The slip, sir, the slip,

746
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,300
can you not conceive?

747
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,700
Pardon, good Mercutio.

748
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,100
My business was great--

749
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
In such a case as mine

750
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,900
a man may strain courtesy.

751
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,400
Come between us,
good Benvolio;

752
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,900
my wit faints.

753
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,900
Thy wit is
very bitter sweeting

754
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,400
it is most sharp sauce.

755
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,900
Why, is not this
better now

756
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,100
than groaning for love?

757
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,800
Now art thou sociable,

758
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,800
now art thou Romeo;

759
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,300
now art thou
what thou art,

760
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,300
by art as well as
by nature.

761
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,800
For this driveling love
is like a great natural

762
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,300
that runs malling
up and down

763
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,300
to hide his bauble
in a hole.

764
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,800
Stop there,
stop there.

765
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,800
Thou desirest me to stop
in my tale against the hair?

766
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,800
Thou wouldst else
have made thy tale large.

767
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,400
No, no, no,
thou art deceived;

768
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,900
For I was come to
the whole depth of my tale,

769
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,000
and meant to occupy
the argument no longer.

770
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,800
Here's goodly gear.

771
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,100
Here's a fine barge.

772
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,300
A sail.

773
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,300
A sail, a sail.

774
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:54,000
Two, two; a shirt
and a smock.

775
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,300
Peter.

776
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,700
Anon.

777
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,900
My fan, Peter.

778
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,500
Good, Peter,
to hide her face,

779
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,700
for her fan's
the fairer of the two.

780
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,800
God ye good morrow,
gentlemen.

781
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,100
God ye good den,
fair gentlewoman.

782
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,700
Is it good den,
I pray?

783
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,300
Well, 'tis no less
I tell you,

784
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,600
for the bawdy hand
of the dial

785
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,600
is now upon the prick
of noon.

786
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,000
Out upon you,
what a man are you?

787
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,800
One, gentlewoman, that God
hath made himself to mar.

788
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,800
By my troth
it is well said,

789
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,300
for himself to mar
quoth 'a?

790
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,800
Gentleman, can any
of you tell me

791
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,500
where I may find
young Romeo?

792
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,300
Romeo, Romeo.

793
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,800
I am the youngest
of that name

794
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,300
for fault of a worse.

795
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,800
If you be he, sir,

796
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,900
I desire some
conference with you.

797
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,200
She will indite him
to some supper.

798
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,700
A bawd, a bawd.

799
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,800
A bawd!

800
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,300
You filthy varmint you!

801
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,200
Here she comes!

802
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,800
Mercutio, no!

803
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,300
An old hare hoar

804
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,100
And an old hare hoar

805
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:38,900
Is very good meat,
in lent

806
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,300
But a hare
that is a hoar

807
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,300
Is too much
for a score

808
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,500
When it hoars
ere it be spent

809
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:01,400
Farewell, ancient lady.

810
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,200
Scurvy knave,
scurvy knave.

811
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,500
I'm none of
his flirt-gills.

812
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,400
I'm none of
his skein mates.

813
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,200
Er, cur, lousy knave,

814
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,200
lousy, lousy knave.

815
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,600
I pray you, sir.

816
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,600
What saucy merchant
was this

817
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,400
that was so full
of his property?

818
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,000
A gentleman, nurse, that loves
to hear himself talk,

819
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,100
and will speak
more in a minute

820
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,100
than he will stand to
in a month.

821
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,400
I'll take him down,

822
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,400
an 'a were lustier
than he is,

823
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,700
and twenty such jacks;

824
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,200
and if I cannot,
I'll find those that shall.

825
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,800
And thou must
stand by too

826
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,200
and suffer every knave

827
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,000
to use me
at his pleasure.

828
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,700
Punk rampant!

829
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,700
Pray you, sir,
a word.

830
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,200
Beef wit.

831
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,700
My young lady bid me
inquire you out.

832
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,200
What she did
bid me say,

833
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,200
I will keep to myself;,

834
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,700
but first
let me tell ye,

835
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,200
if ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise--

836
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,700
Nurse.

837
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,200
Shh! As they say,

838
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,700
it were a very gross
kind of behavior;,

839
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,200
for the gentlewoman
is young;

840
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,700
and therefore if you
should deal double with her,

841
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,200
it were an ill thing to be
offered to any gentlewoman,

842
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,700
and very
weak dealing.

843
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,200
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady and mistress,

844
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,300
I protest unto thee.

845
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,800
Bid her devise,

846
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,300
some means to come to
shrift this afternoon,

847
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,300
and there she shall
at Friar Laurence's cell

848
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:46,500
be shrived and married.

849
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,300
Here's for thy pains.

850
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,300
No, no truly, sir,
not a penny.

851
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,300
Go to,
I say you shall.

852
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,400
No.

853
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,200
Well...

854
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,800
Sir, my mistress
is the sweetest lady.

855
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,700
Lord, Lord, when she were
a little prating thing.

856
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,200
Good-bye. Oh!

857
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,200
O there is
a noble man in town,

858
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,200
One Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard.

859
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:20,200
I anger her sometimes and say
that Paris is the properer man.

860
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,700
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady.

861
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,200
A thousand times.

862
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:57,300
The clock struck nine
when I did send the nurse,

863
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:01,200
in half an hour
she promised to return...

864
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,700
perchance
she cannot meet him;

865
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,700
ahh, that's not so,

866
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,700
oh, she's lame,

867
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,200
love's heralds
should be thoughts!

868
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,200
Had she affections
and warm youthful blood,

869
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,700
she would be
as swift in motion

870
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,200
as a ball.

871
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:22,200
But old folks,
many feign as they were dead,

872
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:26,200
unwieldy, slow, heavy...

873
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,900
And pale as lead.

874
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,200
O God, she comes.

875
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,700
O honey nurse,
what news?

876
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,700
O Lord, why look'st
thou sad?

877
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,700
Though news be sad,

878
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,200
yet tell
them merrily.

879
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,200
Send the man away.

880
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,300
Peter, stay at the gate.

881
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,800
Go on.

882
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,800
Hast thou met
with him?

883
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,300
Oh, I am aweary.

884
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,800
Give me leave awhile.

885
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,800
Fie, how my bones ache!

886
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,200
Ooh!

887
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:06,100
Sweet, sweet...

888
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,100
Sweet nurse.

889
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,600
Tell me, what says my love?

890
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,600
Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

891
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:21,600
and courteous,
and kind,

892
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,600
and handsome,
and, I warrant him,

893
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,600
a virtuous--

894
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,100
Where is your mother?

895
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,600
Where is my mother?

896
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,100
Why, she is within.

897
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,600
Where should she be?

898
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,100
How oddly thou repliest!

899
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,600
"Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

900
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:37,600
where is your mother?"

901
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,200
Oh, God's lady,
are you so hot?

902
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,700
Marry, come up I trow.

903
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,200
Is this the poultice
for my aching bones?

904
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,700
Henceforward do
your messages yourself.

905
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,200
Here's such a coil!

906
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,000
Come! What says Romeo?

907
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,700
Have you got leave
to go to shrift today?

908
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,200
I have.

909
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:03,200
Then, hie you hence
to Friar Laurence's cell,

910
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,700
there stays a husband
to make you a wife.

911
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,300


912
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,700
Now comes the wanton blood
up in your cheeks.

913
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,800
They'll be in scarlet
straight at any news.

914
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,200
Hie you to church!

915
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,400
I'll to dinner.

916
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,200
Honest nurse, farewell!

917
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,600


918
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,200
So smile the heavens
upon this holy act,

919
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,200
that after-hours with sorrow
chide us not.

920
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,200
Amen, amen.

921
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,700
Come what sorrow can,

922
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,200
it cannot countervail
the exchange of joy

923
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,200
that one short minute
gives me in her sight.

924
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,200
These violent delights
have violent ends,

925
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,700
and in
their triumph die,

926
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,200
like fire and powder,

927
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,200
which as
they kiss consume.

928
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,200
The sweetest honey
is loathsome

929
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,700
in its own...

930
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,200
Deliciousness.

931
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,700
Deliciousness.

932
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,700
And in the taste
confounds the...

933
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,000
Appetite.

934
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,300
Appetite.

935
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,200
Therefore
love moderately...

936
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,700
Long love doth so.

937
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,600
Ah, here comes
the lady.

938
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,800
O, so light a foot will ne'er
wear out the everlasting flint.

939
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,700
Juliet!

940
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,700
Good even to
my ghostly confessor.

941
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,200
Romeo shall thank thee,
daughter, for us both.

942
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,700
Ah, Juliet,

943
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,900
if the measure of thy joy
be heaped like mine,

944
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,700
that thy skill be
more to blazon it,

945
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,200
then sweeten
with thy breath

946
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,700
this neighbor air.

947
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,700
They are but beggars
that can count their worth.

948
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,200
But my true love is
grown to such excess,

949
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,700
I cannot sum up
sum of half my wealth.

950
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,900
Come, come with me...

951
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,800
We will make short work.

952
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,300
For, by your leaves,

953
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,300
you shall not
stay alone

954
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,700
till holy church
incorporate two in one.

955
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,300
I pray thee,
good Mercutio, let's retire.

956
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,600
The day is hot.

957
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,900
The Capulets abroad!

958
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,800
If we meet we shall not
'scape a brawl.

959
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,800
For now these hot days
is the mad lood stirring.

960
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Mercutio,let's retire.

961
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,400
Thou art like one
of these fellows

962
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,900
that when he enters
the confines of a tavern

963
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,900
claps me his sword n the table,

964
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,400
and says, "God send me
no need of thee"

965
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,000
and by the operation
of the second cup,

966
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:39,800
draws him on
the drawer,

967
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
when indeed
there is no need.

968
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,400
Am I like
such a fellow?

969
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,700
Nay and there were two such we should have none shortly 
for the one would kill the other.

970
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,900
Why thou hast quarreled with a manfor coughing
in the street

971
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,800
because he hath wakened thy dog
that hath lain asleep in the sun.

972
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,400
And thou wilt tutor me
from quarreling!

973
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,400
Mercutio...

974
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,300
By my head,
here come the Capulets.

975
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,900
By my heel,
I care not.

976
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,800
Gentlemen, good den.

977
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,000
Good den.

978
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,400
A word with one of you.

979
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,600
And but one word
with one of us.

980
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,900
Couple it with something make it a word
and a blow.

981
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:00,400
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir 
and you will give me occasion.

982
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,800
Can you not take some occasion
without the giving?

983
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,500
Mercutio, thou
consortest with Romeo.

984
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:11,600
Consort? 

985
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,200
What dost thou
make us minstrels?

986
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,400
An you make minstrels of us,
you look to hear nothing but discords.

987
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,500
Here's my fiddlestick.

988
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,000
Here's that shall
make you dance.

989
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:25,700
Zounds! Consort!

990
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,300
We talk here in
the public haunt of men.

991
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,800
Either withdraw unto
some private place,

992
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,600
or reason coldly
of your grievances,

993
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,000
or else depart;

994
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,900
here all eyes gaze on us.

995
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:40,000
Men's eyes were made to look,
and let them gaze.

996
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:43,000
I will not budge for
no man's pleasure, I.

997
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,500
Well, peace be
with you, sir,

998
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,500
here comes my man.

999
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:09,400
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford no better
term than thisthou art a villain.

1000
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:19,650
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee doth much excuse
the appertaining rage to such a greetingvillain am I none.

1001
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,900
Therefore farewell,
I see thou knowest not me.

1002
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Boy...

1003
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,500
This shall not excuse the injuries thou hast done me
therefore turn and draw.

1004
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,500
I do protest
I never injured thee,

1005
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:41,400
but love thee better than thou canst devise.
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.

1006
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,400
And so, good Capulet,

1007
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,500
which name I tender
as dearly as mine own,

1008
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,500
be satisfied.

1009
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,500
No, Mercutio.

1010
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,500
O calm, dishonorable,
vile submission!

1011
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,000
No, Mercutio, no!

1012
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,500
Leave me...

1013
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,500
Tybalt, you ratcatcher!

1014
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,100
What wouldest thou
have with me?

1015
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:37,600
Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives,
that I mean tomake bold withal...

1016
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,700
And as you shall use me hereafter...

1017
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,200
Dry-beat the rest of the eight.

1018
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,500
Please, good Mercutio.

1019
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:50,600
Will you pluck your sword
out of his pilcher by the ears?

1020
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,600
Make haste,
lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.

1021
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,600
I am for you, sir.

1022
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,500
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

1023
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,000
Come, come.

1024
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,000
Benvolio, beat down
their weapons!

1025
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,000
Gentlemen, for shame!
Forbear this outrage!

1026
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:27,000
The Prince expressly hath
forbid this bandying in Verona streets.

1027
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,400
Leave us!

1028
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,000
Begone, begone...

1029
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:07,900
I am hurt.

1030
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,800
I am hurt.

1031
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,600
What! Art thou hurt?

1032
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:28,000
A scratch, a scratch,

1033
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,100
marry 'tis enough.

1034
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,100
Courage, man, the hurt
cannot be much.

1035
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:40,000
No, 'tis not so deep as a well,
nor so wide as a church door,

1036
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,500
but 'tis enough;

1037
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,500
you ask for me tomorrow,

1038
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,500
and you shall find me
a grave man.

1039
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,500
Where is my page?

1040
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,100
Go, villain, and fetch me a surgeon.
Fetch me a surgeon!

1041
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,500
Why the devil
came you between us?

1042
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,000
I was hurt under your arm.

1043
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,000
I thought all
for the best, I...

1044
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,900
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
or I shall faint.

1045
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,000
A plague o'
both your houses!

1046
01:20:55,400 --> 01:21:00,000
They have made
worms' meat of me.

1047
01:21:09,000 --> 02:42:15,500
I have it, and soundly too...

1048
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,800
Your houses!
He jests!

1049
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,000
brave Mercutio's dead.

1050
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:52,300
This day's black fate,
on more days doth depend.

1051
01:21:52,900 --> 01:22:02,500
This but begins the woe others must end.
He gone in triumph!
And Mercutio slain!

1052
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:09,900
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
and fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!

1053
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:32,300
This way!

1054
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,500
Now, Tybalt...

1055
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,500
Take the villain back again,

1056
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,000
that late thou gav'st me;

1057
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:54,500
for Mercutio's soul

1058
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,500
is but a little way
above our heads,

1059
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:04,500
staying for thine to keep him company:
either thou, or l, or both, must go with him!

1060
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,400
Let him go!
Let him go!

1061
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Sword, Romeo.

1062
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:28,800
O thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
shalt with him hence.

1063
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,500
This shall
determine that.

1064
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,900
Hit the feet, Romeo!

1065
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:50,100
Protect the eyes, Romeo!

1066
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,100
Give me your sword.

1067
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:16,800
Watch his feet!

1068
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,800
Give me the sword!

1069
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:09,200
The sword!

1070
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,700
The sword!

1071
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,300
Give it to me!

1072
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,500
Your sword, Romeo!

1073
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,700
Romeo, away, be gone.

1074
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,200
The citizens are up.

1075
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,700
Stand not amazed,

1076
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,100
the Prince will doom thee death,
if thou art taken.

1077
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:43,700
Hence, go away!

1078
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:56,400
Oh, I am fortune's fool!
Oh, Romeo! Away, away!

1079
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,800
A curse on the Montagues!

1080
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,800
The best friend I had,

1081
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:15,000
oh, courteous Tybalt,
honest gentleman,

1082
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:19,800
that ever I should live to see thee dead!
Oh, God!

1083
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,800
Did Romeo's hand
shed Tybalt's blood?

1084
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,800
It did, it did,
alas the day, it did!

1085
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,300
Oh, nurse,

1086
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:30,800
oh, serpent heart,
hid with a flow'ring face!

1087
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:33,800
Was ever book containing
such vile matter

1088
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:35,800
so fairly bound?

1089
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:42,800
There's no faith,
no trust,

1090
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,300
no honesty in men;

1091
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,800
all perjured,
all forsworn,

1092
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,300
all naught,
all dissemblers.

1093
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,200
Shame come to Romeo.

1094
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:54,800
Blistered be thy tongue
for such a wish.

1095
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,300
He was not born
to shame.

1096
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,100
Upon his brow shame
is ashamed to sit.

1097
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,700
Will you speak well of him
that killed your cousin?

1098
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:06,300
Shall I speak ill of him
that is my husband?

1099
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:17,800
Poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
when I thy three-hours wife

1100
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,900
have mangled it?

1101
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,100
But wherefore villain,
didst thou kill my cousin?

1102
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,900
Capulet! To the prince!

1103
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,700
Speak, Benvolio, speak!

1104
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,300
Go on, speak.

1105
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,300
Prince!
As thou art true,

1106
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,600
for blood of ours
shed blood of Montague.

1107
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:17,400
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
Tybalt, here slain.

1108
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:25,800
No! Romeo did speak him fair,
bid him bethink how nice the quarrel was,

1109
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,700
and urged withal
your high displeasure.

1110
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,100
It's true, Prince.

1111
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,800
The picture
makes him false.

1112
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,300
He speaks not true.

1113
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:39,500
I beg for justice,

1114
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,300
which thou,
Prince must give.

1115
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:47,400
Romeo slew Tybalt,
Romeo must not live.

1116
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,000
Romeo slew him.

1117
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,600
He slew Mercutio.

1118
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,100
Who now the price
of his dear blood doth owe?

1119
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,300
Not Romeo, Prince...

1120
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:24,800
He was Mercutio's friend.

1121
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:28,800
His fault concludes
but what the law should end.

1122
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:30,900
The life of Tybalt!

1123
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,300
And for that offense,

1124
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,800
immediately we do
exile him hence.

1125
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:39,300
Let Romeo ence in haste,

1126
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,800
else, when he's found...

1127
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:45,000
That hour is his last.

1128
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,200
Ah, banishment...

1129
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:03,700
Be merciful, say death!

1130
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,400
Do not say banishment.

1131
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,700
Arise.

1132
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,800
One knocks;
good Romeo, hide thyself.

1133
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,100
Who's there?

1134
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,800
Who knocks so hard?

1135
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:19,300
Whence come you?

1136
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:20,800
What's your will?

1137
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:22,800
Let me come in,

1138
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,300
and you shall know
my errand.

1139
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:27,300
I come from
Lady Juliet.

1140
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,800
Welcome then.

1141
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:34,300
Holy friar,
o tell me, holy friar,

1142
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:36,300
where's my lady's lord,
where's Romeo?

1143
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:39,000
There, on the ground.

1144
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,600
With his own tears
made drunk.

1145
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:44,300
There is no world
without Verona walls.

1146
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,800
Even so lies she,

1147
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,300
blubbering and weeping,

1148
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,800
weeping and blubbering.

1149
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:52,800
Stand up!

1150
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:56,300
Stand and you
be a man.

1151
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,700
For Juliet's sake,
for her sake,

1152
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,200
rise and stand.

1153
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,700
Why should you fall
into so deep an 'ole?

1154
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,200
Nurse.

1155
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:08,200
Ah, sir, death's
the end of all.

1156
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:10,200
Speakst thou of Juliet?

1157
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:11,200
How is it with her?

1158
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:13,800
Does she not think
me an old murderer?

1159
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,300
Where is she?
How doth she?

1160
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:17,800
What says
my concealed lady

1161
01:32:17,810 --> 01:32:19,300
to our canceled love?

1162
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:22,300
She says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps,

1163
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:24,500
and Tybalt calls,
and then on Romeo cries.

1164
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,500
As if that name
did murder her.

1165
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:30,300
O tell me, friar,
tell me,

1166
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:33,300
in what vile part
of this anatomy

1167
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:35,000
doth my name lodge?

1168
01:32:35,010 --> 01:32:39,000
Tell me that I may sack
the hateful mansion!

1169
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,800
Hold thy
desperate hand.

1170
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,300
By heavens!
Leave it!

1171
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:48,800
Thou hast amazed me.

1172
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,800
Thou a man?

1173
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:53,300
Thy form
cries out thou art.

1174
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,300
Thy tears
are womanish,

1175
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:59,200
thy wild acts denote the
unreasonable fury of a beast.

1176
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,200
Hast thou slain Tybalt?

1177
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,700
Wilt thou slay thyself,
and slay thy lady,

1178
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,200
that in thy life lives,

1179
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:06,700
by doing damned hate
upon thyself?

1180
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,200
Rouse thee, man...

1181
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,700
Thy Juliet is alive.

1182
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,200
There art thou happy.

1183
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,700
Tybalt would kill thee,

1184
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,200
but thou slewest Tybalt;

1185
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,700
there art thou happy.

1186
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,800
The law that threatened death
becomes thy friend,

1187
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:26,200
and turns it to exile; there art thou happy.

1188
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:29,800
A pack of blessings
light upon thy back...

1189
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,900
Ascend her chamber,
hence and comfort her.

1190
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,800
But look thou stay
not till the watch be set,

1191
01:33:39,801 --> 01:33:42,200
for then thou canst not
pass to Mantua,

1192
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:45,300
where thou shalt live
till we find a time

1193
01:33:45,301 --> 01:33:47,800
to blaze your marriage,
reconcile your friends,

1194
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:50,800
beg pardon of the Prince,
and call thee home,

1195
01:33:50,801 --> 01:33:53,200
with twenty hundred
thousand times more joy

1196
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,900
than thou wentest forth
in lamentation.

1197
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:00,700
Go before, nurse...

1198
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,200
Commend me to thy lady,

1199
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:05,200
and bid her hasten
all the house to bed,

1200
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:08,200
which heavy sorrow
makes them apt unto

1201
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:10,200
Romeo's coming.

1202
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,700
Wilt thou be gone?

1203
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:26,200
It is not yet
near day.

1204
01:36:26,201 --> 01:36:29,200
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

1205
01:36:29,201 --> 01:36:34,200
that pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear.

1206
01:36:34,201 --> 01:36:37,300
Nightly she sings
on yond pomegranate tree.

1207
01:36:37,301 --> 01:36:39,700
Oh, believe me, love,

1208
01:36:39,701 --> 01:36:43,200
it was the nightingale.

1209
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:46,200
It was the lark...

1210
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:49,200
The herald of the morn,

1211
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:51,200
no nightingale.

1212
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:57,700
Night's candles
are burnt out...

1213
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:11,200
And jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountaintops.

1214
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:16,700
I must be gone and live,

1215
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,000
or stay and die.

1216
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:24,700
Yond light is not
daylight...

1217
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,700
I know it, I.

1218
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,700
Therefore stay yet,
thou needst not to be gone.

1219
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,200
Oh, let me be taken,

1220
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,700
let me be put to death.

1221
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,700
I am content so thou
wilt have it so.

1222
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,700
I'll say yon gray
is not the morning's eye,

1223
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,700
nor that is not
the lark

1224
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:50,300
whose notes do beat
the vaulty heavens

1225
01:37:50,301 --> 01:37:51,600
so high above
our heads.

1226
01:37:51,601 --> 01:37:56,800
I have more care
to stay than will to go.

1227
01:37:56,801 --> 01:38:00,200
Come death, and welcome,
Juliet wills it so.

1228
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:05,200
It is...

1229
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:08,100
It is, hie hence,
be gone away.

1230
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,100
Romeo, it is.

1231
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:18,200
It is the lark that
sings so out of tune,

1232
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:22,700
straining harsh discords,
and unpleasing sharps.

1233
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,700
Some say the lark
makes sweet division;

1234
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:30,200
oh, this doth not so,
for she divideth us.

1235
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:31,200
So now be gone,

1236
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:33,400
more light and light
it grows.

1237
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,900
More light and light,

1238
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,700
more dark and dark
our woes.

1239
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,200
Madam!

1240
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:46,200
Your lady mother
comes to your chamber.

1241
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:49,700
Nurse.

1242
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,700
Your lady mother is
coming to your chamber.

1243
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,700
The day is broke,
look about.

1244
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,200
Oh, art thou gone so,

1245
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,700
my husband, friend?

1246
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,200
I must hear from thee
every day in the hour,

1247
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:06,700
for in a minute
there are many days,

1248
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:10,200
o by this count
I shall be much in years,

1249
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:12,200
ere I again behold my Romeo.

1250
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:14,200
I will omit
no opportunity

1251
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:16,700
that may convey
my greetings, love, to thee.

1252
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,200
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

1253
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:26,700
I doubt it not,

1254
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,200
and all these woes
shall serve

1255
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:32,700
for sweet discourses
in our time to come.

1256
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:38,700
Farewell, farewell,

1257
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,200
one kiss
and I'll descend.

1258
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:06,700
Adieu.

1259
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:15,000
Adieu!

1260
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:22,600
Oh, God!

1261
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:46,700
We will have vengeance
for it,

1262
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,200
fear thou not...

1263
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,700
No!

1264
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,200
Then weep no more.

1265
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,700
I'll send to one
in Mantua,

1266
01:41:00,701 --> 01:41:03,700
where that same
banished runagate doth live

1267
01:41:03,701 --> 01:41:08,200
shall give him such
an unaccustomed dram,

1268
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:11,200
that he shall soon
keep Tybalt company.

1269
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:13,700
No!

1270
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:17,700
But now I'll tell thee
joyful tidings, girl.

1271
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:21,200
Well, then thou hast
a careful father,

1272
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,200
one who to put thee
from thy heaviness

1273
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,700
hath sorted out
a sudden day of joy.

1274
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:32,200
And joy comes well
in such a needy time.

1275
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:35,200
Marry, my child,
early next Thursday morn,

1276
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:37,700
the gallant, young
and noble prince,

1277
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,700
the county Paris,
at St. Peter's church,

1278
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,700
shall happily make thee
there a joyful bride.

1279
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:49,200
Now by St. Peter's church,
and Peter too,

1280
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:53,700
he shall not make me there
a joyful bride!

1281
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:56,100
No! No!

1282
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:01,800
So, it is concluded.

1283
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:08,800
Son, Paris.

1284
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:16,000
How now, wife, have you
delivered to her our decree?

1285
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:18,700
Ay, sir,
but she will none,

1286
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,700
she gives you thanks.

1287
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,500
I would the fool were
married to her grave.

1288
01:42:25,501 --> 01:42:31,700
Soft...
take me with you.

1289
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,700
Take me with you, wife.

1290
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:38,200
How? Will she none?

1291
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:40,700
Doth she not
give us thanks?

1292
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,200
Is she not proud?

1293
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:46,700
Doth she not count her blessed,
unworthy as she is,

1294
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,300
that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

1295
01:42:51,301 --> 01:42:53,800
Wretched fool!
Let me see her!

1296
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,300
Ungrateful baggage!

1297
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:58,700
Say what thou wilt,
thou shalt not house with me!

1298
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,400
Fie! What, are you mad?

1299
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:02,200
Hang thee,
young baggage!

1300
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:03,400
Disobedient wretch!

1301
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:06,700
I tell thee what,
get thee to church on Thursday,

1302
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,700
or never after
look me in the face.

1303
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:12,200
Oh, father, good father,
I beseech you.

1304
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,700
Speak not, reply not,
do not answer me.

1305
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,200
My fingers itch.

1306
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:19,200
You are to blame, my lord,
to rate her so.

1307
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:20,700
And why,
my lady wisdom?

1308
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,200
Hold your tongue!

1309
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:24,700
Good prudence, smatter
with your gossips, go!

1310
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,200
I speak no treason.

1311
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:27,700
May not one speak?

1312
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,200
Speak!
You mumbling fool!

1313
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:31,200
Utter your gravity
o'er a gossip's bowl,

1314
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:32,700
for here we need it not.

1315
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,200
You are too hot.

1316
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:38,600
God's bread,
it makes me mad.

1317
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:42,900
Thursday's near.

1318
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,200
Lay hand on heart, advise.

1319
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:48,300
An you be mine,
I give you to my friend;

1320
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,700
an you be not,

1321
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,600
hang, beg, starve,
die in the streets.

1322
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:53,700
No!

1323
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:56,300
For by my soul,
I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,

1324
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,400
for what is mine
shall never do thee good.

1325
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,200
Father!

1326
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:05,700
Trust to't, bethink you,
I'll not be forsworn.

1327
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:15,400
Oh, no! No!

1328
01:44:15,401 --> 01:44:18,200
Oh sweet, my mother,
cast me not away.

1329
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,700
Delay this marriage
for a month, a week, oh!

1330
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,800
Talk not to me,
for I'll not speak a word.

1331
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:29,200
Do as thou wilt,
for I have done with thee.

1332
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:36,100
Oh, God!

1333
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,200
Oh, nurse?

1334
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:39,200
How shall this
be prevented?

1335
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:41,200
What sayest thou?

1336
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:44,200
Hast thou not
a word of joy?

1337
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:46,600
Some comfort, nurse.

1338
01:44:46,601 --> 01:44:49,200
Faith, here it is.

1339
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,700
Romeo is banished...

1340
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:56,200
And all the world
to nothing,

1341
01:44:56,201 --> 01:44:59,200
that he dares ne'er come back
to challenge you;

1342
01:44:59,201 --> 01:45:03,200
or if he do, it needs must
be by stealth.

1343
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:07,700
Then since the case so stands
as now it doth,

1344
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:12,600
I think it best
you marry with the county.

1345
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:24,700
True.

1346
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,200
O he's a lovely
gentleman.

1347
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,800
Romeo's
a dishclout to him.

1348
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:40,100
An eagle, madam,
hath not so green,

1349
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:43,600
so quick, so fair an eye
as Paris hath.

1350
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:45,100
Beshrew my heart,

1351
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:48,600
I think you happy
in this second match.

1352
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:51,400
It excels your first.

1353
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:56,500
For if it did not,
your first is dead,

1354
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,600
or 'twere as good he were
as living here,

1355
01:45:59,601 --> 01:46:02,600
and you no use of him.

1356
01:46:02,601 --> 01:46:05,400
Speakest thou
from thy heart?

1357
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:11,700
And from my soul, too...

1358
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,100
Or else
beshrew them both.

1359
01:46:16,101 --> 01:46:17,600
Amen.

1360
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:20,100
What?

1361
01:46:20,101 --> 01:46:24,900
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvelous much.

1362
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:31,600
Go in, and tell my lady
I am gone,

1363
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:33,100
having displeased my father,

1364
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,100
to Laurence's cell,

1365
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:38,100
to make confession
and to be absolved.

1366
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,600
Marry, I shall,
and this is wisely done.

1367
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:45,100
Go!

1368
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:18,000
You say you do not know
the lady's mind.

1369
01:47:18,001 --> 01:47:21,000
Uneven is the course,
I like it not.

1370
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:23,500
Immoderately she weeps
for Tybalt's death,

1371
01:47:23,501 --> 01:47:26,000
and therefore have I
little talked of love,

1372
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:29,000
for Venus smiles not
in a house of tears.

1373
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,100
Happily met,
my lady and my wife.

1374
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:49,400
That may be, sir,
when I may be a wife.

1375
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:54,500
Come you to make
confession to this father?

1376
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,400
Are you at leisure,
holy father, now,

1377
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:02,300
or shall I come to you
at evening mass?

1378
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,600
My leisure serves me,
pensive daughter, now.

1379
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:07,200
My lord, we must entreat
the time alone.

1380
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:10,000
God shield I should
disturb devotion.

1381
01:48:10,001 --> 01:48:13,400
Juliet, on Thursday early
will I rouse thee.

1382
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,500
Till then, adieu...

1383
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
and keep this holy kiss.

1384
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,300
Oh, shut the door,
and when thou hast done so,

1385
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:37,000
come weep with me,
past hope,

1386
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:40,700
past care, past help.

1387
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:53,500
Oh, Juliet, I already
know thy grief.

1388
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,400
Tell me not, Friar,
that thou heard'st of this,

1389
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:59,400
unless thou tell me
how I can prevent it.

1390
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:02,900
If in thy wisdom
thou cans't give no help...

1391
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,100
Hold, daughter.

1392
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:24,000
I do spy a kind of hope,

1393
01:49:24,001 --> 01:49:26,500
as that is desperate
which we would prevent.

1394
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,500
If rather than to marry
county Paris,

1395
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,500
thou hast
the strength of will to--

1396
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:36,500
O bid me leap,
rather than marry Paris,

1397
01:49:36,501 --> 01:49:38,000
from off the battlements
of any tower,

1398
01:49:38,001 --> 01:49:39,800
or bid me go
into a new-made grave

1399
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:42,500
and hide me with a dead man
in his shroud.

1400
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:43,600
Hold then.

1401
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:58,000
Go home.

1402
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,900
Be merry.

1403
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:05,900
Give consent
to marry Paris.

1404
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Oh, no.

1405
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:10,300
Wednesday is tomorrow.

1406
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:16,000
Tomorrow night
look that thou lie alone,

1407
01:50:16,001 --> 01:50:19,600
let not the nurse
lie with thee in thy chamber.

1408
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:31,600
Take thou this phial,
being then in bed...

1409
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:40,100
And this distilling liquor
drink thou off...

1410
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:46,000
When presently through
all thy veins shall run

1411
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:48,900
a cold and drowsy humor;,

1412
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,400
for no pulse shall keep
his native progress,

1413
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:54,900
but surcease;

1414
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:00,500
no warmth, no breath
shall testify thou livest...

1415
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:07,400
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death

1416
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:13,400
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours...

1417
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:24,000
And then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

1418
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:32,000
In the meantime,
against thou shalt awake

1419
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:35,400
shall Romeo by my letters
know our drift,

1420
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,400
and hither shall he come,

1421
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,900
and he and I
will watch thy waking,

1422
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,600
and that very night shall Romeo
bear thee hence to Mantua.

1423
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Give me, give me!

1424
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:50,300
Tell me not of fear.

1425
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,200
Hold, then.

1426
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:02,400
Get thee gone.

1427
01:52:02,401 --> 01:52:04,900
Be strong and prosperous
in this resolve.

1428
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,400
How now, my headstrong.

1429
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,400
Where have you
been gadding?

1430
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,400
Where I have learnt me

1431
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,900
to repent the sin
of disobedient opposition.

1432
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,900
Pardon me,
henceforward l,

1433
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,300
I am ever ruled by you.

1434
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:00,300
Why, I am glad on't!

1435
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:02,900
This is well.
Stand up.

1436
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:05,200
This is
as it should be.

1437
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,600
Love give me strength.

1438
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:13,400
Give this letter
into the hand of Romeo,

1439
01:54:13,401 --> 01:54:14,500
in Mantua.

1440
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:52,900
My lord! My lord!

1441
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,700
She's dead,
Juliet is dead!

1442
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,600
My Lady Juliet, my lord.
She's dead, she's dead!

1443
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:07,200
My baby,
where is she?

1444
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:13,800
O lamentable day.

1445
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:17,900
Death lies on her
like an untimely frost

1446
01:55:17,901 --> 01:55:22,700
upon the sweetest flower
of all the field.

1447
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:39,100
Master.

1448
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,700
Balthasar!

1449
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:45,400
How fares my Juliet?

1450
01:57:45,401 --> 01:57:48,600
For nothing can be ill,
if she be well.

1451
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:51,500
How fares my lady?

1452
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:05,800
She's dead, my lord.

1453
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:07,800
She's dead.

1454
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:10,800
Her body sleeps
in capel's monument.

1455
01:58:10,801 --> 01:58:14,800
I saw her laid low
in her kindred's vault.

1456
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:29,300
Then, I defy you, stars!

1457
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:54,400
Live...

1458
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:59,200
and be prosperous.

1459
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:01,700
Farewell, good fellow.

1460
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:11,700
Juliet.

1461
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:03,400
O my love...

1462
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:09,800
My wife.

1463
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:16,300
Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath,

1464
02:02:16,301 --> 02:02:19,500
hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.

1465
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:26,300
Thou art not conquered...

1466
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:34,300
Beauty's ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips

1467
02:02:34,301 --> 02:02:36,800
and in thy cheeks.

1468
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:41,800
Death's pale flag
is not advanced there.

1469
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:49,400
Tybalt.

1470
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:58,700
Liest thou there
in thy bloody sheet?

1471
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:13,000
What more favor
can I do to thee,

1472
02:03:13,001 --> 02:03:17,500
than with that hand
that cut thy youth in twain

1473
02:03:17,501 --> 02:03:23,300
to sunder his
that was thine enemy?

1474
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:32,000
Forgive me, cousin.

1475
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:45,200
Ah, dear Juliet.

1476
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:52,700
Why art thou yet so fair?

1477
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:58,000
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous,

1478
02:03:58,001 --> 02:04:00,500
and that the lean
abhorred monster

1479
02:04:00,501 --> 02:04:03,800
keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

1480
02:04:03,801 --> 02:04:10,500
For fear of that,
I still will stay with thee.

1481
02:04:15,100 --> 02:04:20,500
Never from this palace
of dim night depart again.

1482
02:04:23,100 --> 02:04:28,000
Here, here will I remain,

1483
02:04:28,001 --> 02:04:33,500
with worms that are
thy chambermaids.

1484
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:54,900
Eyes, look your last.

1485
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:04,500
Arms, take your last embrace.

1486
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:12,000
And lips,
o you the doors of breath,

1487
02:05:12,001 --> 02:05:14,000
seal with a righteous kiss

1488
02:05:14,001 --> 02:05:16,800
a dateless bargain
to engrossing death.

1489
02:05:55,100 --> 02:05:57,600
Here's to my love.

1490
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:28,100
Thus with a kiss...

1491
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:31,500
I die.

1492
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:46,500
Who's there?

1493
02:06:46,501 --> 02:06:50,000
A friend, and one
that knows thee well.

1494
02:06:50,001 --> 02:06:53,000
Balthasar. How long
hast thou been here?

1495
02:06:53,010 --> 02:06:54,500
Full half an hour.

1496
02:06:54,501 --> 02:06:56,900
Go with me to the vault.

1497
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,400
I dare not, sir.

1498
02:06:58,401 --> 02:07:01,400
My master knows not
that I am gone hence.

1499
02:07:01,401 --> 02:07:04,100
Stay then,
I'll go alone.

1500
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:08,000
Fear comes upon me.

1501
02:07:08,001 --> 02:07:11,300
O much I fear
some ill unlucky thing.

1502
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:51,500
Romeo!

1503
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,400
Oh, what an unkind hour

1504
02:08:04,401 --> 02:08:08,100
is guilty of this
lamentable chance?

1505
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:05,800
O comfortable Friar,
where is my lord?

1506
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,400
I do remember well
where I should be,

1507
02:09:10,401 --> 02:09:12,400
and there I am.

1508
02:09:12,401 --> 02:09:14,400
Where is my Romeo?

1509
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:19,000
I hear some noise.

1510
02:09:19,001 --> 02:09:21,500
Oh, where is my Romeo?

1511
02:09:21,501 --> 02:09:25,500
Oh, lady, come from this nest
of death, contagion,

1512
02:09:25,501 --> 02:09:27,000
and unnatural sleep.

1513
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:32,000
A greater power
than we can contradict

1514
02:09:32,001 --> 02:09:33,500
hath thwarted
our intents.

1515
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:36,000
Come along.
The watch is coming.

1516
02:09:36,001 --> 02:09:38,100
Where is my Romeo?

1517
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,800
Come. Go, good Juliet.

1518
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:49,500
No.

1519
02:09:49,501 --> 02:09:51,500
I dare no longer stay.

1520
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:53,000
No!

1521
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:55,900
I dare no longer stay.

1522
02:09:55,901 --> 02:09:57,400
Juliet!

1523
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,900
I dare no longer stay.

1524
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:04,400
I dare
no longer stay!

1525
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:47,100
What's here?

1526
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,200
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

1527
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:01,900
O churl!

1528
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,900
Drunk all,
and left no friendly drop

1529
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,900
to help me after!

1530
02:11:06,905 --> 02:11:08,900
I will kiss thy lips;

1531
02:11:08,901 --> 02:11:11,900
haply some poison
yet doth hang on them

1532
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:14,900
to make me die
with a restorative.

1533
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,900
Thy lips are warm!

1534
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:36,800
Oh, no, no!

1535
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,500
Lead, boy, which way?

1536
02:11:49,501 --> 02:11:51,400
Search about
the churchyard.

1537
02:11:51,401 --> 02:11:53,000
Go, some of you...

1538
02:11:53,001 --> 02:11:54,500
Yea, noise?

1539
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:00,100
No!

1540
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:10,000
Then I'll be brief,
o happy dagger!

1541
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:14,500
This is thy sheath;

1542
02:12:14,505 --> 02:12:18,000
there rest and let me die.

1543
02:14:08,900 --> 02:14:10,800
Where be these enemies?

1544
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:14,700
Capulet!

1545
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:19,800
Montague!

1546
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:31,900
See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate...

1547
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:38,500
that heaven finds means
to kill your joys with love;

1548
02:14:38,501 --> 02:14:48,300
and l, for winking
at your discords too,

1549
02:14:48,350 --> 02:14:53,000
have lost
a brace of kinsmen.

1550
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:58,100
All are punished.

1551
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:05,800
All are punished!

1552
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:41,900
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.

1553
02:15:41,901 --> 02:15:47,400
The sun for sorrow
will not show his head,

1554
02:15:47,401 --> 02:15:50,900
for never was a story
of more woe

1555
02:15:50,901 --> 02:15:56,100
than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.
