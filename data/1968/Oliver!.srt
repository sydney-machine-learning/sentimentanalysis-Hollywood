- How much did you say?
- Only three guineas, Mr. Sowerberry.

98
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:24,702
- A bargain, if ever there was one.
- I was looking for a boy.

99
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:26,948
All right, bring him in, Mr. Bumble.

100
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:33,264
My love, I said we might consider
taking this boy...

101
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,503
...to help in the shop.

102
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,305
Dear me. He’s very small.

103
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:43,751
He is rather small, there’s no denying,
but he'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry.

104
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:47,231
I dare say he will.
On our bittles and our drink!

105
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:50,430
These workhouse boys
always cost more than they’re worth.

106
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:53,106
- Where did he come from?
- Mother came to us destitute.

107
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:58,220
She gave birth to him and promptly died,
leaving no forwarding name or address.

108
00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:01,623
Here he is, yours for three guineas.
Cash on delivery.

109
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:06,431
No, cash upon liking. A week on approval.

110
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:11,750
If he works hard on a little food,
then we’ll keep him.

111
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:14,705
He can help put the shutters up.
Do you hear, now?

112
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:18,262
- Then he can clean around the house.
- I'll look after him, missus.

113
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:23,349
My dear, it occurred to me,
he’ll make a delightful coffin-follower.

114
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:28,984
That expression of melancholy.
Interesting, don’t you think so, my love?

115
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:34,628
I don’t mean a regular coffin-follower
to attend grown-up people, no...

116
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:37,107
...just at children’s funerals.

117
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:40,462
A mute in proportion, so to speak?

118
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:44,467
Precisely. A superb effect, don’t you think?

119
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:48,667
Do you think you could look like
that gentlemen up there?

120
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:54,629
Perhaps, if I had a tall hat.

121
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:25,067
Look, it’s Oliver!

122
00:19:57,752 --> 00:19:59,390
- Noah, come on.
- No.

123
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:10,431
How’s your mother, workhouse?

124
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:18,141
You leave my mother out of it. She’s dead.

125
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:24,506
What did she die of? Shortage of breath?

126
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:31,230
You’d better not say anything
about her to me.

127
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:33,742
Don’t be cheeky, workhouse.

128
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:38,787
Your mother, she was a nice one,
a regular right-down bad one.

129
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,028
What did you say?

130
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:45,629
It’s a good thing she died when she did
"cause she’d be in prison doing hard labour.

131
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:49,225
Help!

132
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:57,863
Get away! Get away from him!

133
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:05,388
What’s going on down here?
What are you trying to do, wake the dead?

134
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,111
It’s you! Get out of here!

135
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,711
He started it!

136
00:21:10,632 --> 00:21:12,031
Come here, you!

137
00:21:42,912 --> 00:21:44,903
- Quick!
- Hurry up.

138
00:21:47,592 --> 00:21:48,388
Oh, dear!

139
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:50,144
I'm going off. Water!

140
00:21:51,152 --> 00:21:55,191
Noah, run over to the workhouse.
Get Mr. Bumble. Tell him to come quick.

141
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,108
Where is he? Where is the young rascal?

142
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:24,023
- Oliver?
- Yes, I'm here.

143
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:27,508
- Do you know this voice?
- Yes, I do.

144
00:22:27,672 --> 00:22:31,824
Ain't you afraid of it?
Ain’t you trembling when I speak?

145
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,591
No, l’m not!

146
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:39,828
- He’s gone mad to speak to you like that.
- It’s not madness, it’s meat.

147
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:43,463
- Meat?
- Meat, ma'am! You overfed the boy.

148
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:47,706
You raised an artificial spirit in the lad
unbecoming to his station in life.

149
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:50,431
This wouldn’t have happened
if you’d fed him gruel.

150
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,221
l’d be glad to give you the recipe.

151
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:56,783
- Having a rest, Mr. Bumble?
- He’s sitting on Oliver.

152
00:22:56,872 --> 00:23:00,751
- Quite right. We must all sit on Oliver.
- You’ve been drinking again?

153
00:23:01,072 --> 00:23:04,542
- I met a friend in the cemetery.
- Help!

154
00:23:06,712 --> 00:23:07,940
Who’s in there?

155
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:10,990
That coffin should not have been occupied
until tomorrow.

156
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:13,540
It’s reserved for a very important client.

157
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,907
Stand back!

158
00:23:17,392 --> 00:23:20,862
- What’s your explanation, you scallywag?
- He called my mom a name.

159
00:23:20,952 --> 00:23:24,865
And what if he did, you ungrateful wretch?
She deserved what he said and worse.

160
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:26,067
- She didn’t!
- She did!

161
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:27,187
It’s a lie.

162
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:31,743
- Hold your tongue, boy.
- Put him down in the cellar.

163
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:35,503
It’s really quite comfortable.

164
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,068
Stay there till we decide
what to do with you.

165
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:43,790
Here’s your baggage, workhouse.

166
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,944
Three pounds, indeed!
You can take him back.

167
00:24:26,472 --> 00:24:29,782
"Where is love?

168
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:36,028
"Does it fall from skies above?

169
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:44,101
"Is it underneath the willow tree

170
00:24:45,112 --> 00:24:48,787
"That I've been dreaming of?

171
00:24:52,512 --> 00:24:55,026
"Where is she

00:24:58,392 --> 00:25:01,987
"Who I close my eyes to see?

Don’t say you don’t know
what a "beak" is?

198
00:30:28,432 --> 00:30:30,343
It’s a bird’s mouth, isn’t it?

199
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:33,146
My eyes, how green can you get!

200
00:30:33,592 --> 00:30:36,265
For your information,
a beak is a magistrate.

00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:42,301
- Who you running from, your old man?
- No, l’m an orphan.

- Not a farthing.

Do you know of anywhere?

210
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:23,985
I know a respectable old gentleman
who'll give you lodgings for nothing.

211
00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:29,028
And never ask for the change,
if a gentleman he knows introduces you.

- Yeah, a laundry!

Not exactly. A laundry would be
a very nice thing indeed.

too well though, Charlie.

343
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:09,102
We’ll have to pick the initials out
with a needle.

344
00:46:09,752 --> 00:46:14,030
- You'll need to learn how to do this, too.
- Yeah, the trademark.

345
00:46:14,392 --> 00:46:17,589
In the meantime,
you must learn how to make wallets.

346
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:23,146
- Like the Dodger. Would you like that?
- Yes, if you'll teach me.

347
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:25,781
Certainly, my boy, no fee.

348
00:46:26,072 --> 00:46:28,632
Just do as Dodger and the others do.

349
00:46:28,712 --> 00:46:32,022
Make them your models,
especially Dodger.

350
00:46:32,152 --> 00:46:34,985
He’s going to be a right little Bill Sikes.

351
00:46:36,072 --> 00:46:38,870
Who’s Bill Sikes, Mr. Fagin?

352
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,870
He’s a very clever gentleman.

353
00:46:44,952 --> 00:46:46,590
You’ll meet him tomorrow.

354
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:49,101
Maybe now. Is it possible, by chance...

355
00:46:49,512 --> 00:46:53,425
...that my kerchief is protruding
from my pocket?

356
00:46:54,192 --> 00:46:56,706
- Yes. I can just see the edge.
- Can you?

357
00:46:57,512 --> 00:47:00,549
See if you can take it out
without my feeling it...

358
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:02,863
...like you saw the others do.

359
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:20,028
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys

360
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:25,104
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two"

361
00:47:27,592 --> 00:47:29,947
Is it gone?

362
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:35,907
Yes, Mr. Fagin. Look!

363
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:41,621
Well, that’s a surprise, I must say.

364
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:47,146
You’re a clever boy, Oliver.
I never saw a sharper lad.

365
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:50,027
Here’s a shilling for you.

366
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:54,069
I have to go to the bank.

367
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:57,391
Bedtime, all of you!
There’s a hard day’s work ahead!

368
00:47:57,552 --> 00:47:59,110
Put up the shutters.

369
00:48:05,512 --> 00:48:07,104
Where do I sleep, sir?

370
00:48:09,672 --> 00:48:10,900
Over here, my dear.

371
00:48:11,592 --> 00:48:12,820
Settle down!

372
00:48:12,952 --> 00:48:15,785
Dodger, take your legs off his bed.
Where’s your manners?

373
00:48:16,912 --> 00:48:19,346
Here, my dear, have a good sleep.

374
00:48:37,752 --> 00:48:39,151
If you go on...

375
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:41,668
...the way you’ve started...

376
00:48:42,232 --> 00:48:46,384
...you will be the greatest man of all time.

377
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:52,423
Sweet dreams, Oliver.

378
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:58,944
Sweet dreams.

379
00:49:01,152 --> 00:49:02,824
Goodnight, sir.

380
00:49:10,472 --> 00:49:16,149
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two, boys

381
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:27,347
"You’ve got to pick a pocket or two"

382
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,423
Is he here?

383
00:51:02,872 --> 00:51:05,306
Mr. Sikes. Has he come yet?

384
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:07,821
Nancy’s inside waiting for him.

385
00:51:31,752 --> 00:51:35,540
- How’s business? Nice and brisk?
- Don’t burn your fingers, will you?

386
00:51:35,712 --> 00:51:39,148
I never do, my dear. Not if I can help it.

387
00:51:57,712 --> 00:52:00,226
Nancy! He’s back! He’s here!

388
00:52:55,112 --> 00:52:56,830
Beautiful.

389
00:53:14,072 --> 00:53:15,391
You’ve done well, Bill.

390
00:53:17,232 --> 00:53:19,427
All one job?

391
00:53:26,552 --> 00:53:28,065
Such a professional.

392
00:53:36,472 --> 00:53:38,064
Now, Bill...

393
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:43,147
Carry cash? At this time of night?

394
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:46,708
All those thieves
and robbers lurking in dark alleys?

395
00:53:47,192 --> 00:53:48,784
I wouldn’t dare.

396
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:52,506
Besides, l’ve got to price it first.

397
00:53:55,672 --> 00:53:58,470
Nancy’s waiting. Give you a good supper.

398
00:54:02,552 --> 00:54:03,780
Tomorrow, Bill.

399
00:54:05,192 --> 00:54:06,671
My word on it.

Get to work, then. No argument.
There’s fine pickings in the street.

544
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:31,830
- Go and earn your keep.
- You said we could see the hanging!

545
01:09:31,912 --> 01:09:33,630
Be sure it ain’t your own.

546
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:35,270
Fagin, l’m waiting.

547
01:09:36,592 --> 01:09:39,186
Waiting, my dear? What for?

548
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:43,505
Bill will give you what for, if you don’t
fork out. Hand over, start counting.

549
01:09:43,592 --> 01:09:45,389
- Rush.
- What do you think we are?

550
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,828
- You and Bill, you’ll be the ruin of me!
- That’s right.

551
01:09:48,912 --> 01:09:50,664
If it’s all the same to you.

552
01:09:54,552 --> 01:09:56,668
- What was that for?
- For getting caught.

553
01:09:56,752 --> 01:09:58,151
I was only practising.

554
01:09:58,912 --> 01:10:01,631
I'll die a pauper yet. Here, take it.

555
01:10:01,712 --> 01:10:04,863
I'll starve. You’ll find me in the gutter
with me feet in the air.

556
01:10:04,952 --> 01:10:08,388
Bill might think the count is a bit short,
wouldn’t you say?

557
01:10:10,912 --> 01:10:16,703
I only wish you had to get rid of the stuff,
that’s all I wish.

558
01:10:16,832 --> 01:10:18,948
He still might, come on.

559
01:10:22,032 --> 01:10:26,344
So me and the boys we’ll live on air
till I find a customer?

560
01:10:26,512 --> 01:10:30,187
Heartless, that’s what I am.
Come on, Bet. Ta-ta, kids.

561
01:10:34,832 --> 01:10:38,142
Young Oliver wants to come
on the game with Charlie and me.

562
01:10:40,592 --> 01:10:42,947
What’s that? On the job, you mean?

563
01:10:45,192 --> 01:10:48,150
Can I? Please? I’d like to.

564
01:10:49,552 --> 01:10:52,862
Would you? Well, why not?

565
01:10:53,112 --> 01:10:56,422
You got to start somewhere.
You couldn’t do it in better company.

566
01:10:57,632 --> 01:11:00,829
- Look after him, Dodger.
- Hats on, boys. Time we’re off.

567
01:11:00,992 --> 01:11:04,029
- Then I can go, sir?
- Good luck on your first job, my dear.

We’ll catch him.

622
01:15:53,312 --> 01:15:55,030
He went that way.

01:16:15,712 --> 01:16:19,182

Watch where you’re going!

627
01:17:23,432 --> 01:17:25,229
There’s the gent he stole from.

628
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,468
Can you identify this boy as the thief?

629
01:17:27,912 --> 01:17:30,824
Yes, I saw him run away.

630
01:17:32,472 --> 01:17:36,147
Why didn’t you look after him?
Why didn’t you bring him back with you?

631
01:17:36,232 --> 01:17:37,347
How can I help it?

632
01:17:37,432 --> 01:17:40,583
A fine thing, Oliver in jail,
and tomorrow he’ll be before a beak!

633
01:17:40,672 --> 01:17:43,266
For pinching a wallet.
He goes to jail, what’s it matter?

634
01:17:43,352 --> 01:17:46,344
l’m afraid he may say something
which will get us into trouble.

635
01:17:46,432 --> 01:17:50,027
That’s very likely, Fagin.
You see, you’re blowed upon.

636
01:17:55,472 --> 01:17:57,508
And l’m afraid, you see, that...

637
01:17:58,872 --> 01:18:01,181
...if the game was up with us...

638
01:18:01,952 --> 01:18:04,512
...it might be up with a good many more.

639
01:18:05,712 --> 01:18:09,022
It would come out rather worse for you...

640
01:18:10,192 --> 01:18:12,228
...than it would for me.

641
01:18:16,912 --> 01:18:22,669
Why you miserable,
sneaking, treacherous old...

642
01:18:23,992 --> 01:18:26,108
You go down to that court
in the morning...

643
01:18:26,192 --> 01:18:28,342
...and you will find out what happens.

644
01:18:29,072 --> 01:18:35,261
Me? Go to court?
With a magistrate sitting there?

645
01:18:35,392 --> 01:18:37,826
I'll go, they won’t know me.

646
01:18:38,272 --> 01:18:41,070
Good girl. Clever girl.

647
01:18:41,952 --> 01:18:44,625
And if he does talk,
you’ll come and tell us quick...

648
01:18:44,992 --> 01:18:47,870
..."cause then we’ll have to
look after ourselves, won’t we?

649
01:18:47,952 --> 01:18:51,388
You won’t have to look after yourself.

650
01:18:52,432 --> 01:18:54,627
"Cause l’ll look after you, believe me.

651
01:18:54,952 --> 01:18:58,911
I always believe you. Have another drink.

652
01:19:08,992 --> 01:19:10,948
Silence in court.

653
01:19:39,832 --> 01:19:44,781
What crime is this one charged with?
He looks a thorough reprobate, to me.

654
01:19:44,872 --> 01:19:47,022
Speak up, man! What’s he charged with?

655
01:19:47,112 --> 01:19:51,071
He’s not charged, Your Worship.
This gentlemen appears against the boy.

656
01:19:52,432 --> 01:19:55,981
- What boy? I see no boy.
- The boy in the dock, Your Worship.

657
01:19:58,152 --> 01:20:01,986
- Yes. Stand up, boy!
- He is standing up.

658
01:20:02,152 --> 01:20:04,871
Don’t be impertinent.
Put him on a box or something.

659
01:20:08,752 --> 01:20:12,028
- What’s he charged with?
- Picking pockets, sir.

660
01:20:12,912 --> 01:20:14,550
What’s your name, boy?

661
01:20:18,192 --> 01:20:20,023
Does your father know you’re here?

662
01:20:27,512 --> 01:20:29,468
He says he’s an orphan.

663
01:20:30,032 --> 01:20:31,909
Where do you come from?

664
01:20:33,352 --> 01:20:35,070
Where do you live?

665
01:20:35,632 --> 01:20:37,748
Who looks after you?

666
01:20:48,712 --> 01:20:51,943
He doesn’t seem able to say where he lives
or anything else.

667
01:20:56,552 --> 01:20:58,588
A liar as well as a thief.

668
01:20:59,552 --> 01:21:02,271
And insolent, too. That settles it.

669
01:21:02,352 --> 01:21:05,628
The boy is committed to three months
with hard labour.

670
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,625
This is disgraceful! I demand to be heard.

671
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:09,861
You have not yet...

672
01:21:09,952 --> 01:21:13,422
- I was there.
- Remove this lunatic! Clear the court.

673
01:21:13,512 --> 01:21:16,982
I will speak, I saw what happened.
He was outside my shop.

674
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:21,111
Two other boys stole the wallet.
This child had nothing to do with it.

Hasn’t it?

677
01:21:34,632 --> 01:21:37,192
He didn’t talk. Case was dismissed.

678
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:41,626
What a great judge! Fetch the boy.

679
01:21:41,952 --> 01:21:45,024
- I’ve done my share.
- Look!

Where are we going?

682
01:21:52,312 --> 01:21:56,305
At least I can make some amends.
You’re coming home with me. Jump in.

683
01:22:02,912 --> 01:22:05,187
- After them.
- Let the kid go.

684
01:22:05,272 --> 01:22:07,866
- He can still blab on us, can’t he?
- Leave him be.

685
01:22:09,552 --> 01:22:11,190
Don’t lose him.

- Shut your trap, Dodger.

You’ve caused enough trouble already.
It’s going to be done quiet, no fuss.

It’s no good trying it on with me.

768
01:35:59,072 --> 01:36:03,145

by that remark?

769

What I say. I’m not going!

770
01:36:12,592 --> 01:36:15,789

He won’t do you no harm!

Why can’t you leave him where he is?
Where he’ll have the chance at a good life?

772
01:36:21,392 --> 01:36:23,303
You’ll bring him back here, my girl...

773
01:36:23,992 --> 01:36:26,825
...unless you want to feel my hand
on your throat.

774
01:36:27,792 --> 01:36:32,912
Nancy, my dear,
we must have that boy brought back.

775
01:36:33,312 --> 01:36:38,181
If he talked, think what would happen
to us. Think what would happen to Bill.

776

It would be the gallows for him, the drop.

777

would you, my dear? Not to Bill.

All right. Mrs. Bedwin, the books
are on the table beside my bed.

You’ll take those books to Mr. Jessop.

825
01:42:57,712 --> 01:43:01,421
Tell him you have come to pay
the £4.10 that I owe him.

826
01:43:01,832 --> 01:43:04,949
This is £5 note,
so there'll be 10 shillings change.

Yes.

01:44:12,592 --> 01:44:15,789
"Such a sky you never did see

845
01:44:15,952 --> 01:44:21,948
"Who will tie it up with a ribbon
And put it in a box for me?"

846
01:45:42,672 --> 01:45:45,140
- Help!
- Get in the cart.

847
01:45:48,272 --> 01:45:50,740
Bull’s-eye, come here.

848
01:46:13,992 --> 01:46:16,586
- Oliver’s back.
- Look at his togs.

849
01:46:16,672 --> 01:46:21,462
- He’s got books, too. Quite the little gent.
- Lovely bit of stuff.

850
01:46:21,592 --> 01:46:24,060
Delighted to see you’re so well, my dear.

851
01:46:24,272 --> 01:46:27,423
Dodger will give you another suit
in case you spoil that Sunday one.

852
01:46:27,512 --> 01:46:29,309
Look at this!

853
01:46:32,192 --> 01:46:33,989
I'll bank it for you.

854
01:46:34,592 --> 01:46:36,344
What’s that?

855
01:46:37,912 --> 01:46:42,747
- That’s mine, Fagin.
- No. Mine, ours.

856
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:48,066
- You shall have the books.
- You hand it over, you old skeleton.

857
01:46:52,592 --> 01:46:54,469
That’s for our share of the trouble.

858
01:46:55,152 --> 01:46:57,620
You keep the books. Start a library.

859
01:46:57,792 --> 01:47:02,070
Mr. Brownlow will be here after you if he
finds out you’ve got his books and money.

860
01:47:03,232 --> 01:47:07,703
So he’ll be here, will he?
Out here, after us?

861
01:47:10,512 --> 01:47:13,185
- What did you tell him about us?
- Nothing.

862
01:47:14,792 --> 01:47:17,511
I'll wager this young rat’s
told him everything.

863
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:19,831
What did you tell him?

864
01:47:26,232 --> 01:47:28,985
- No, leave him alone.
- You stand off me.

865
01:47:29,072 --> 01:47:30,107
No violence.

866
01:47:30,192 --> 01:47:32,945
You’ll have to kill me
before you lay a hand on that boy.

867
01:47:33,032 --> 01:47:35,421
Don’t you tell me. You keep out of this.

868
01:47:35,512 --> 01:47:38,185
If he says he didn’t tell them,
he didn’t tell them.

869
01:47:38,272 --> 01:47:39,546
Hit me, would you?

870
01:47:39,632 --> 01:47:46,185
I won’t stand by and see it done.
Let him be, or l’ll put my mark on you...

871
01:47:46,312 --> 01:47:50,146
Nancy, you’re wonderful tonight!
Such talent! Such a joker!

872
01:47:50,592 --> 01:47:52,867
You take care, I don’t know,
but do it, Fagin...

873
01:47:53,032 --> 01:47:57,071
...or l’ll put the finger on all of you,
and I don’t care if I hang for it.

874
01:47:59,232 --> 01:48:04,226
- Do you know who you are? What you are?
- You don’t have to tell me.

875
01:48:04,312 --> 01:48:07,941
- A fine one for the boy to make a friend of.
- Yes, I am, God help me.

876
01:48:08,992 --> 01:48:12,951
And I wish l’d been struck down dead
before l’d laid a hand to bring him back.

877
01:48:13,432 --> 01:48:15,104
From tonight he’s a liar...

878
01:48:15,832 --> 01:48:18,869
...and a thief, and all that’s bad.

879
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:21,831
Ain’t that enough for you
without beating him to death?

880
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:25,825
Come, come, Sikes.
We must have civil words.

881
01:48:27,832 --> 01:48:30,585
Yes, you deserve them from me, don’t you?

882
01:48:30,912 --> 01:48:33,745
I thieved for you when I was half his age.

883
01:48:33,832 --> 01:48:37,984
- It’s your dirty work I been doing since.
- It’s a living isn’t it?

884
01:48:38,072 --> 01:48:44,591
- He’s right, Nancy, a living is a living.
- Some living, Lord help me. Some living!

885
01:48:45,032 --> 01:48:46,704
Get to bed, all of you.

886
01:48:48,392 --> 01:48:50,826
Get to bed, I said!

887
01:48:51,312 --> 01:48:54,543
All this violence, all these scenes,
screams, dramas!

888
01:48:55,072 --> 01:48:57,791
l’m asking you, is it necessary?

889
01:48:59,512 --> 01:49:00,865
Not yet, Fagin.

890
01:49:03,712 --> 01:49:08,740
But if this godforsaken little
good-for-nothing’s uttered one word...

891
01:49:09,672 --> 01:49:11,867
If he has, the little devil...

892
01:49:11,992 --> 01:49:18,830
...we sit down, talk it over, we think it out,
we decide a safe action, we stay calm.

893
01:49:20,192 --> 01:49:23,423
Do we? And while we’re sitting here...

894
01:49:23,872 --> 01:49:27,581
...thinking, and talking, and staying calm...

895
01:49:27,712 --> 01:49:32,502
...our collars get felt.
And it’s, "Come with me, if you please."

896
01:49:33,712 --> 01:49:35,509
No, thank you.

897
01:49:35,792 --> 01:49:40,547
You thought us into this lot.
You can think your way out of it.

898
01:49:41,592 --> 01:49:45,665
From now on, Bill Sikes
takes the law into his own hands.

899
01:49:46,712 --> 01:49:48,191
These hands.

900
01:49:49,752 --> 01:49:55,224
Have you ever heard the sound
of a chicken getting its neck wrung?

901
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:59,429
Can’t say I have...

902
01:49:59,912 --> 01:50:03,541
They squawk, Fagin, they squawk.

903
01:50:05,112 --> 01:50:06,909
Not a very pretty sound.

904
01:50:08,192 --> 01:50:09,102
No, Bill.

905
01:50:09,192 --> 01:50:12,389
And then they die, don’t they?

906
01:50:13,592 --> 01:50:15,947
Yes. I mean, no.

907
01:50:16,472 --> 01:50:21,262
They say some even start squawking
before that even.

908
01:50:21,392 --> 01:50:25,351
They get what you might call
a premonition.

909
01:50:28,152 --> 01:50:32,350
You’re wouldn’t be having no premonition
of that sort, would you?

910
01:50:33,552 --> 01:50:36,988
Not me, Bill. The lips are sealed.

911
01:50:37,712 --> 01:50:43,025
l’m glad. Because if anyone here
should lead the law to me...

912
01:50:43,512 --> 01:50:48,188
...and I gets to hear of it,
then it will be your neck.

913
01:50:48,672 --> 01:50:52,984
Your scraggy old neck.

914
01:51:00,792 --> 01:51:02,350
You think about it, Fagin.

915
01:51:30,232 --> 01:51:33,827
A violent man, Dodger.
A very violent man.

916
01:51:35,072 --> 01:51:38,701
When that man’s back is up, no one is safe.

917
01:52:11,272 --> 01:52:12,944
Look after him, Dodger.

918
01:52:16,512 --> 01:52:18,980
And l’ll look after myself.

919
01:52:28,832 --> 01:52:30,982
A man’s got a heart, hasn’t he?

920
01:52:32,192 --> 01:52:34,422
Joking apart, hasn’t he?

921
01:52:35,272 --> 01:52:40,141
"Though l’d be the first one to say
that I wasn’t a saint

922
01:52:42,152 --> 01:52:48,182
"l’m finding it hard to be really as black
as they paint

923

01:52:57,512 --> 01:53:01,027
"Can a fellow be a villain all his life?

925
01:53:01,192 --> 01:53:07,950
"All the trials and tribulation!
Better settle down and get meself a wife

926
01:53:08,072 --> 01:53:11,747
"And the wife would cook and sew for me
And come for me, and go for me

927
01:53:11,832 --> 01:53:15,268
"And go for me and nag at me
The finger she would wag at me

928
01:53:15,352 --> 01:53:18,822
"The money she would take from me
A misery, she’d make from me

929
01:53:19,752 --> 01:53:22,585
"I think l’d better think it out again!

930
01:53:25,112 --> 01:53:31,506
"A wife you can keep, anyway

931
01:53:33,032 --> 01:53:37,071
"Left without anyone in the world
And l’m starting from now

932
01:53:38,472 --> 01:53:43,182
"So, how to win friends
and to influence people?

933
01:53:44,552 --> 01:53:45,951
"So, how?

"l’m reviewing the situation

935
01:53:55,832 --> 01:53:58,869

"I will own a suite at Coleridge’s

With friendliness, as much as is

"Is it such a humiliation
For a robber to perform an honest job?

948
01:55:01,432 --> 01:55:05,061
"So a job l’m getting, possibly
I wonder who my boss'll be?

01:55:05,152 --> 01:55:08,508

"I think l’d better think it out again!"

965
01:56:44,392 --> 01:56:49,512
So, when I heard about dear little Oliver,
I decided to come to London.

966
01:56:49,592 --> 01:56:52,948
- I decided.
- It was good of you to come.

967
01:56:53,112 --> 01:56:54,625
What have you got to tell me?

968
01:56:54,992 --> 01:56:57,426
This locket once belonged
to the boy’s mother.

969
01:56:57,512 --> 01:56:59,707
Found by the wife after she passed away.

970
01:57:00,232 --> 01:57:02,871
The boy’s mother, that is,
not my dear wife.

971
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:17,502
- You’ve kept this all these years?
- Why should I not?

972
01:57:17,632 --> 01:57:21,341
Didn’t it occur to you that it might provide
the answer to the boy’s parentage?

973
01:57:21,432 --> 01:57:25,391
- His identity! His name!
- He had none. The mother was unmarried.

974
01:57:25,512 --> 01:57:28,982
It is your clear duty to show this evidence
to some higher authority.

975
01:57:29,192 --> 01:57:32,582
- Your behaviour, madam, was shameful.
- How dare you speak to me so!

976
01:57:32,672 --> 01:57:34,503
I only came here to help you.

977
01:57:34,912 --> 01:57:37,710
You came here to profit
from your own greed and dishonesty.

978
01:57:37,792 --> 01:57:40,784
- You don’t think it belongs to my wife?
- Be quiet.

979
01:57:41,072 --> 01:57:45,190
Your reward and something for the locket.
Your lucky you’re not in the law’s hands.

980
01:57:45,272 --> 01:57:47,740
- Show these people out.
- There’s gratitude for you!

981
01:57:50,352 --> 01:57:54,231
I hope this unfortunate circumstance
won’t deprive me of my parochial office?

982
01:57:54,352 --> 01:57:56,024
My hope, sir, is that it will.

983
01:57:56,272 --> 01:57:59,184
But it was all Mrs. Bumble.
I knew nothing till yesterday.

984
01:57:59,312 --> 01:58:02,622
No excuse. In the eyes of the law
you are the more guilty of the two.

985
01:58:02,712 --> 01:58:05,670
The law supposes your wife acts
under your direction.

986
01:58:05,752 --> 01:58:08,550
If that’s what the law supposes, sir,
then the law’s an ass.

987
01:58:08,632 --> 01:58:11,226
If that’s the eye of the law, sir,
then law’s a bachelor.

988
01:58:11,392 --> 01:58:16,671
The worst I wish the law is that it’s eye
be opened by experience. By experience!

989
01:58:26,592 --> 01:58:30,107
Sir, the locket, I didn’t really see it.

990
01:58:30,232 --> 01:58:34,669
I recognised it at once. I gave it
to my niece, Emily, on her 18th birthday.

991
01:58:35,872 --> 01:58:39,421
So it wasn’t just her young man jilting her
that made her run away?

992
01:58:39,912 --> 01:58:40,708
No.

993
01:58:41,992 --> 01:58:45,701
She must have made her way to that
workhouse and had her baby there.

994
01:59:19,912 --> 01:59:20,947
What’s going on?

995
01:59:23,072 --> 01:59:26,667
- Why have you brought the boy here?
- "Cause he’s coming on a job...

996
01:59:27,912 --> 01:59:28,947
...with me.

997
01:59:29,112 --> 01:59:30,022
But, why him?

998
01:59:31,792 --> 01:59:35,102
Because I need a little one. That’s why.

999
01:59:36,312 --> 01:59:37,665
And he’s nice and thin.

1000
01:59:38,712 --> 01:59:41,749
And on this particular job,
that’s what counts.

1001
01:59:44,152 --> 01:59:45,426
Must I go?

1002
01:59:45,832 --> 01:59:47,185
One word out of you...

1003
01:59:48,232 --> 01:59:52,191
...while you’re out with me
and you know what will happen.

1004
01:59:59,672 --> 02:00:03,381
Bill, you can’t do this to him.
Please! You can’t!

1005
02:00:03,672 --> 02:00:05,424
- I won’t let you...
- No more of that.

1006
02:00:10,992 --> 02:00:13,506
You just be at the tavern at 11:00.

1007
02:01:09,592 --> 02:01:13,710
- I’ve come about Oliver. Tell Brownlow...
- You better come inside. Mr. Brownlow!

1008
02:01:13,792 --> 02:01:16,909
- No. I just want to leave a message.
- But he’ll want to see you.

1009
02:01:17,032 --> 02:01:19,751
- Please! I can’t stay!
- Sir, this person wants to...

1010
02:01:19,832 --> 02:01:21,788
- Who is it?
- It’s about the boy, sir.

1011
02:01:21,912 --> 02:01:24,221
- Is there news of him?
- He’s in danger.

1012
02:01:24,352 --> 02:01:26,627
He was dragged off
the day you sent him out.

1013
02:01:26,752 --> 02:01:28,947
- Who took him?
- Me and someone else.

1014
02:01:29,112 --> 02:01:31,342
- You took him by force?
- Yes!

1015
02:01:32,032 --> 02:01:34,944
- Now I wish I had never been part of it.
- Where is he now?

1016
02:01:35,112 --> 02:01:37,831
Who is this other person?
Can you take me to him?

1017
02:01:37,952 --> 02:01:40,420
You want to help the boy.
Why else are you here?

1018
02:01:40,512 --> 02:01:42,628
- Then tell me where he is!
- I can’t!

1019
02:01:44,792 --> 02:01:47,590
I'll bring him to you. Not here. It’s too far.

1020
02:01:47,912 --> 02:01:48,867
Where, then?

1021
02:01:50,152 --> 02:01:52,871
London Bridge, tonight at midnight.

1022
02:01:53,832 --> 02:01:57,188
But you’ve got to come alone.
Promise you’ll come on your own!

1023
02:01:58,952 --> 02:02:02,661
You don’t trust me, do you?
But you’ve got to.

1024
02:02:04,992 --> 02:02:08,143
- I'll be there.
- Thank God. Let me go.

1025
02:02:08,792 --> 02:02:11,352
Wait! Is the boy hurt, ill-treated?

1026
02:02:11,552 --> 02:02:15,750
I can’t say no more. Please!
He’ll kill me as it is if he finds out.

1027
02:02:16,472 --> 02:02:19,384
- Who is this man?
- No, I won’t tell you.

1028
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:23,352
Whatever I do, I won’t turn on him.

1029
02:02:27,672 --> 02:02:29,310
You wouldn’t understand.

1030
02:02:33,392 --> 02:02:34,871
l’ve got to go back.

1031
02:02:36,632 --> 02:02:38,031
I want to go back.

1032
02:02:42,232 --> 02:02:44,792
- Promise you’ll come?
- At 12:00.

1033
02:03:15,832 --> 02:03:19,108
Remember, you little worm, the front door.

1034
02:03:33,232 --> 02:03:34,142
There.

1035
02:04:22,992 --> 02:04:23,947
Hurry!

1036
02:04:31,792 --> 02:04:33,066
Look above you.

1037
02:05:16,792 --> 02:05:18,748
Who is it? Who’s there?

1038
02:05:19,392 --> 02:05:21,622
Rufus! Dragon! Come down, seize him!

1039
02:05:27,552 --> 02:05:29,190
Seize him! Good dog!

1040
02:06:09,232 --> 02:06:12,622
Why worry, my dear? He always turns up!

1041
02:06:17,312 --> 02:06:20,429
Maybe he’s taken Oliver back to my place.

1042
02:06:20,632 --> 02:06:23,704
- He said he was coming straight here.
- And that’s what he’ll do.

1043
02:06:37,272 --> 02:06:40,981
- Everything all right, Bill?
- No it’s not, Fagin.

1044
02:06:41,832 --> 02:06:46,269
- The brat woke them up. We had to run.
- Anybody see you?

1045
02:06:46,592 --> 02:06:47,342
No.

1046
02:06:53,312 --> 02:06:56,065
I'll just take the boy and put him to bed.
I'll be back.

1047
02:06:59,992 --> 02:07:01,186
Put him back.

1048
