1
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,549
Don't let it be day.

2
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,032
Get up.

3
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,554
Mmm, not yet.

4
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,631
I'm having a heart attack.

5
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,519
Every day is the same:
Heart attacks, cancer.

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,352
Get up.

7
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,592
I'm dead.

8
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,399
Can I move my arms?

9
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,950
Lazy Mary, will you get up?

10
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,839
Will you get up?
Will you get up?

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,709
Lazy Mary, will you get up?
Or you'll be late for...

12
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,235
What?
- School.

13
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,160
Good morning, Rachel dear.

14
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,273
Morning, Mother.

15
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,796
Say, I was wondering if by any chance
you intend to pass Shabab's...

16
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,349
...on your way home from school
this evening?

17
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,598
Well, I don't intend anything
at the moment but I can.

18
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,470
Well, maybe you could pick me up
one of those nice chocolate bars.

19
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,435
All right.

20
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,755
It can be small.

21
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,309
The 5 cent one's
plenty good enough for me.

22
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,755
Good morning, Hector.

23
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,592
Morning, Rachel.

24
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,591
You're out on the job early this morning.

25
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,638
I had the damnedest nightmares
all night long.

26
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,869
Guilty conscience?

27
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,951
Don't I wish.

28
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,475
Rachel.

29
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,235
Don't get me the milk, you know.
Get the plain.

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,231
- Not too much cholesterol in that.
- What?

31
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,308
The chocolate.

32
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,038
What was she doing up there?

33
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,590
She thinks of everybody
and now all the other...

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,592
Stupid thought.

35
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,954
Morbid.

36
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,078
I mustn't give houseroom in my skull
to that sort of thing.

37
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,912
Muriel Simpson says she'll die

38
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,198
For the want of the Golden City

39
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,591
She is handsome, she is pretty

40
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,309
She's the queen of the Golden City

41
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,593
Inside, Grade 2s.

42
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,672
Everybody at his seat
before the bell stops.

43
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,637
Come on, now.

44
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Miss Cameron?

45
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,999
Boy, what a day, huh?

46
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,720
There's chill in the air now,
but it's gonna be a scorcher.

47
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,394
Yes, the summer certainly
seems to be upon us.

48
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,632
Yeah. Angela's working
on her summer cold already.

49
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,030
Every year like clockwork.

50
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,919
Hey, you know,
your eyes look a little red too.

51
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,999
Uh, the sandman failed to pay
his usual visit to me last night.

52
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,038
You know, you ought to take
a nerve relaxer. I do.

53
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,509
Once the tension's gone...

54
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,116
...sleep can be a very
sensual experience.

55
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,114
Leighton, is there something special
you have in mind?

56
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,272
Oh, well, Angela and I were wondering...

57
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,954
...if you'd like to have some supper
with us at home tonight.

58
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,439
Well, she'd really like it.

59
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,275
So would I. I mean, we've been meaning
to have you for a very long time...

60
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,874
...but Angela's been busy
with out-of-town relations...

61
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,191
...and now summer's here
and we haven't had our little Rachel in...

62
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,476
Angela's been busy
with out-of-town relations...

63
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,189
...and now summer's here
and we haven't had our little Rachel in...

64
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,998
...for a single meal.

65
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,310
So if you could see your way clear...

66
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,869
...you'd be putting balm
on sore consciences.

67
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,873
Well, tonight is my mother's
bridge night. Uh...

68
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,519
Leighton, I'm awfully sorry.

69
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,035
I usually fix her coffee and sandwiches.

70
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,998
Oh, what a pity.

71
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,878
So we're gonna have a lot of fun.

72
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,871
And an old friend of yours
is gonna be there too.

73
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,075
Just the four of us.

74
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,753
- Who is that?
Uh-uh.

75
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,433
Too late now. Ha, ha.

76
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,079
Unless you change your mind.

77
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,551
James Doherty,
will you get off that swing this instant?

78
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,872
Or else.

79
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,231
James.

80
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,313
Look at you, the fastest gun in the West
and the slowest thing on two feet.

81
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Now, look alive.

82
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,358
Hup, two, three, four.

83
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,158
Hup, two, three, four.

84
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,355
That's a boy.

85
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,318
Thattaway.

86
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,873
That's very good.

87
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,914
Miss Cameron.

88
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,108
Just a minute. Get in line.

89
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,920
We' re off to the library
to look at castles and keeps.

90
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
What are you off to?

91
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,198
- We're going to be fairies and butterflies.
- Ooh.

92
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,989
Oh, guess who invited me
for supper tonight and I said no.

93
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,513
The Groper.

94
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,910
He probably serves rat.

95
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,152
Come on up after,
I bought you a nothing gift.

96
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,389
What?

97
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,551
A companion that needs taking care of...

98
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,429
...but unlike your mother,
it doesn't talk back.

99
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,398
All right.

100
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,193
Have all my Walter Raleighs died?

101
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,194
Drawbridges do not open by themselves.

102
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,591
Thank you.

103
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,196
Psst! Outside.

104
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,478
Close the door.

105
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,679
Four times five equals 20.

106
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,277
Four times six equals 24.

107
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,352
I've been going over
your attendance records...

108
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,397
...among other things.

109
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,237
James Doherty's been absent too much.

110
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,116
Three weeks in March.

111
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,834
Ten days in May.

112
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,194
And again this week.

113
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,715
Yes, I know, it's tonsillitis.

114
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,228
James has too much honor
to play hooky.

115
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,755
I only wanna talk to him, Rachel.

116
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,673
Now, would you send the
young gentleman out to me, please?

117
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,628
Leighton, it's his mother's fault,
she wrote the excuses.

118
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,394
Would you like to conduct
the entire investigation?

119
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,790
...one equals nine.

120
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,238
Nine times two equals 18.

121
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,110
Nine times three equals 27.

122
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,956
Nine times four equals 36.

123
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,672
James.

124
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,952
Would you go to Mr. Siddley, please?

125
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,269
He's waiting in the hall.

126
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,956
James, get your things. Come along.

127
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,793
- Where are we going?
- Home, to my house.

128
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Miss Cameron.

129
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,155
What?

130
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,959
Do I still have to call you
Miss Cameron anymore?

131
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,874
Darling, you can call me
anything you like.

132
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,518
Coward.

133
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,317
God, but I wanna leave this school.

134
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,913
No, you don't.

135
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,719
If you wanted to leave, you'd leave.

136
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,159
You'll never leave anything, Rachel.

137
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,315
Rachel Cameron says she'll die

138
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,677
For the want of the Golden City

139
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,037
She is handsome, she is pretty

140
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,317
She's the queen of the Golden City

141
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,950
She is pretty, one, two, three

142
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,157
Queen of Golden City

143
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,029
Y oo-hoo!

144
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,391
Child.

145
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,439
Calla, I have asked you before
not to call me "child. "

146
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,635
It sounds ridiculous.

147
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,313
Sorry, slip of the tongue.

148
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,595
You coming up?

149
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,675
I'd come down but I'm busy
trying to get my eagle back in his cage.

150
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,551
Jacob, will you get your ass down here?

151
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Just ignore him.

152
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,831
Where's my present?

153
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,958
May it watch over you till fall.

154
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Oh.

155
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,878
It's the one we saw at the flower show.

156
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,871
Naturally.

157
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,871
I can't take that.

158
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,792
That's too much.

159
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,995
I'll borrow it from you.

160
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,559
Oh, shut up.

161
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Look.

162
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,555
When things get glumpy,
you just hold it up to the light.

163
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,314
You get the feeling
you're actually sitting under it.

164
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,552
And everything gets very calm and quiet.

165
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,598
It's too much.

166
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,231
I just wish I had something
to give to you.

167
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,592
What are you planning to do
between now and Labor Day?

168
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,716
Sit on the porch with Mama?

169
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,594
I guess so.

170
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,389
I am going to paint my apartment lilac.

171
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,195
We bought a whole mess of lilac paint
on sale...

172
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,157
...to use at tabernacle.

173
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,278
But nobody liked it but me.

174
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,038
I'm gonna get a good suntan.

175
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,352
No, I'm not.

176
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,753
Every summer, I say that
and I buy oodles of suntan lotion...

177
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,549
...and at the end of the summer,
I'm still just as pale as a mushroom.

178
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,439
Yeah, well, we shouldn't make too much
of vacations.

179
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,397
They're just time like any other time.

180
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,837
A dozen Sunday newspapers.

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,230
I'm in the exact middle of my life.

182
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,392
What?

183
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,832
I'm exactly in the middle of my life.

184
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,230
This is my last...

185
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,029
...ascending summer.

186
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,273
Everything else from now on is just...

187
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,639
...rolling downhill into my grave.

188
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,270
My life didn't even begin
until a year ago next week.

189
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,353
The eve of the Fourth of July
was my Dependence Day.

190
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,112
Independence.

191
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,558
Don't correct me. That was the day
I started leaning on the Lord.

192
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,553
Calla, we made a bargain
not to talk about that.

193
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,756
I think friends are more important
than bargains.

194
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,235
I'm not gonna listen.

195
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,992
I'm just gonna whistle.

196
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,030
Don't you wanna open yourself up
to life and loving experiences?

197
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,557
Calla, if I wanna hear people yell and
slobber and make fools of themselves...

198
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,392
...I will go to an insane asylum.

199
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,554
You're certainly an authority...

200
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,188
...for someone who doesn't know
a damn thing about it.

201
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,954
Well, I don't know whether
you're talking about God or LSD.

202
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,280
That's the second time
you've been bitchy today.

203
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,872
"Don't call me 'child,' Calla.
It sounds ridiculous. "

204
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,314
You just made me aware
of how we talk, that's all.

205
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,160
Like Sidony T ravis,
have you ever heard her?

206
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,912
" Rachel, dear,
would you be a good girl...

207
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,038
...and pass me
one of those yummy cookies? "

208
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,359
Calla, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

209
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,753
Well, back to our respective cages.

210
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,195
I just wanna say one thing.

211
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,510
Every time we've ever gone
for an ice cream cone...

212
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,079
...you've ordered vanilla.

213
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,390
That's not the only kind, Rachel.

214
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,952
There are 30 other flavors,
plus a flavor of the month.

215
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,032
And there are more people on this Earth
than just you.

216
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,752
Calla.

217
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,118
When's the next...?

218
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,196
- What do you call it? Service?
- T omorrow. Why?

219
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,672
If you want me to, I'll come.

220
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,439
Don't do me any favors.

221
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,959
Do you want your tree back?

222
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,598
All right, I'm gonna plant it.

223
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,398
Right here in the asphalt.

224
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,152
Oh, Rachel.

225
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,309
Nighty-night.

226
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,631
Nighty-night.

227
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,629
Slaughter, slaughter
Undertaker's daughter

228
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,829
Slaughter, slaughter

229
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,560
Undertaker's daughter

230
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,950
Slaughter, slaughter

231
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,680
Undertaker's daughter

232
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,035
Slaughter, slaughter

233
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,509
Undertaker's daughter

234
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,910
Slaughter, slaughter

235
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,594
Undertaker's daughter

236
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,990
Slaughter, slaughter

237
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,628
Undertaker's daughter

238
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,109
Slaughter, slaughter

239
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,669
Undertaker's daughter

240
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,349
Rachel, is that you out there?

241
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,560
You ought to be upstairs with your mom.

242
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,159
Are you Stevie?

243
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
No, I'm Nick.

244
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,151
You look just like Stevie.

245
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,710
Twins means you look like somebody.

246
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,314
- Did Dad put him in the basket?
- Yeah.

247
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,151
Did you...? Did you watch?

248
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,389
They wouldn't let me.

249
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,352
Rachel.

250
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,677
Did I hear myself say to get upstairs
or was that my imagination?

251
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,354
Dad, what are you gonna do to him?

252
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,309
I'm gonna make him happy again
and put back his smile.

253
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,119
Now, you best do what I ask
before I count to three. One.

254
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,395
What made him die?

255
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,355
He had the infantile, like all the others.
I'm counting, miss. One's used up.

256
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,909
You know what happens
when I get to three.

257
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,193
Two.

258
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,278
Two and a half.

259
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,032
Two and three-quarters.

260
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,557
Two and seven-eighths.

261
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,155
Three.

262
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,231
You're awfully late this evening, dear.

263
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,549
I almost gave up.

264
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,153
I'm sorry.

265
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,232
I don't enjoy sitting here
entertaining the pots and pans.

266
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,591
- Where are you?
- I'm right here, Mother.

267
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Don't kiss me, dear.

268
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,911
I'm all full of egg white.

269
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,912
Oh, I'm exhausted.

270
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,514
When it got to be 6:00
and you still hadn't come...

271
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,229
...I thought, "Oh, my goodness,
she's correcting papers.

272
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,676
Shabab's will be closed and I bet
she forgot all about my chocolate bar. "

273
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,513
Oh. I did. I'm sorry.

274
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,193
I'm not criticizing, dear.

275
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,679
We all forget sometimes.

276
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,353
Anyhow, I got it myself.

277
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,829
I took a nice long walk in the heat.

278
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,115
Well, why don't you just lie down and
take a rest and I'll fix the sandwiches?

279
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,395
Oh, no, darling.

280
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,959
Really, I'm fine.

281
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,314
Truly, I am.

282
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,472
I just hope you're not coming down
with something.

283
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Why? Should I be?

284
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,750
Well, dear, do that over here
where I can see you.

285
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,752
You have a fever?

286
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,273
- No.
- Here.

287
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,953
Give me your forehead.

288
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,916
Oh, just a little warm, that's all.

289
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,116
Mother, I'm always warm.

290
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,193
I heard the most awful thing
about the Stewart girl today.

291
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,715
Cassie Stewart has, shall we say...

292
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,074
...been away.

293
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,190
Been away with quotation marks?

294
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,635
Double quotation marks. Twins.

295
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,109
And no prospect of a husband in sight.

296
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,876
Can you imagine her poor mother?

297
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,110
She's a very nice woman. Really, she is.

298
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,840
Not too cultivated but very nice.

299
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,953
Oh, what a heartbreak for her.

300
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Twins.

301
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,431
Yes, I suppose that must be
twice the heartbreak of one.

302
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,635
That's right, dear.

303
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,836
Just go ahead and make light of it.

304
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,991
Life is just a comedy to you.

305
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,669
She going to keep them?

306
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,751
Oh, that's what's so awful about it.
She is.

307
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,592
I found out all about it.

308
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,035
It was Mrs. Barnes that told me.

309
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,875
I ran into her this morning on the porch
at poor old Mr. Shoemaker's funeral.

310
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,959
And I said to her... I said... I said:

311
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,156
"Well, I thank my lucky stars...

312
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,269
...I never had one moment's worry
with either one of my daughters. "

313
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,279
Oh, Verla, you're not going to no-trump.

314
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,635
Oh, girls, isn't she the meanest thing?

315
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,950
Don't be a sore loser, May.

316
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,838
When you come to my house,
you can win.

317
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,069
Three hearts.

318
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,470
May I be a greedy piggy
and look at that candy box?

319
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,393
I think I'll just try
one of these peppermints.

320
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,757
Don't feel them, Florence.
You always feel everything.

321
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,399
I wish somebody would explain...

322
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,870
...why they keep putting
those green ones in with the limey taste.

323
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,669
If they're going to look like peppermints,
they should taste like peppermints.

324
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,955
Don't you agree?

325
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,395
Excuse me, but I have to go to bed now.

326
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,560
Oh.

327
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,631
Until later, dear.

328
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,153
Oh, my precious.

329
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,117
And I thank you so much.

330
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,793
Goodness, yes.

331
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,555
Well, those elegant sandwiches
were simply delicious.

332
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,039
So glad you enjoyed them.

333
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,633
Enjoyed them?

334
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,475
I'm not gonna be able
to haul myself out of this chair.

335
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Good night.

336
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,911
Good night.
Good night.

337
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,551
I think Rachel is just marvelous.

338
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,039
I mean, the way she manages things.

339
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,953
And anybody who teaches
is an absolute saint.

340
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,429
Oh, she's always been wonderful.

341
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Don't, Rachel.

342
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,073
Don't.

343
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,758
But it's just so I can sleep.

344
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,553
Don't.

345
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,995
Okay, everybody back. Come on.

346
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,391
Now, vacation hasn't started yet.
Don't push.

347
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,276
Goodbye, James.

348
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,434
"Some relations
with a double standard. "

349
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,952
What are you gonna have today, Rachel?

350
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,951
I'll have some, uh, cigarettes...

351
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,238
...and, uh, chocolate bars.

352
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,395
Oh, should I get some suntan lotion?

353
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,278
Take a small one, Rachel.

354
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,908
I'll give you a check
for the whole caboodle, all right?

355
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,116
Rachel Cameron.

356
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,553
Nick.

357
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,952
Nick Kazlik.

358
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,759
The one with the brother in the basket.

359
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,031
- You're staring.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

360
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,350
I don't think I would've recognized you.

361
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,318
I mean, we haven't seen each other
since high school.

362
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,835
Thought we'd have
your company at Leighton's.

363
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,792
Oh, were you the one? Oh.

364
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,632
I'll give you a chance to make it up.

365
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,030
- You wanna go to a movie tonight?
- What's playing?

366
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,352
What's the difference?

367
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,317
That'll be 4.02, Rachel.

368
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,311
Oh, thank you, Lee.

369
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,751
Well, actually, I couldn't go tonight...

370
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,959
...because I promised a friend
that I would go someplace with her.

371
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,432
Actually, I ought to be pointing my nose
in the direction of home right now.

372
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,033
Excuse me.

373
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,799
Thank you.

374
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,552
You still live in the same place?

375
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,870
Oh, yes, I keep house for my mother.

376
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,190
I have since my father died.

377
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,839
I didn't know he died.

378
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,399
There's no need for condolences.

379
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,516
It was 14 years ago.

380
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,148
That's a lot of housekeeping.

381
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,639
You didn't get to college?

382
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,553
Yes, I went to college.
But when he died, I had to come back.

383
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,679
You see, my mother sold the place
to Hector Jonas...

384
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,478
...for such a nominal sum...

385
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,950
...that, uh, he allowed us to live upstairs
in perpetuity.

386
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,315
Or at least until we were ready
to take our business downstairs to him.

387
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,512
I'm sorry, what did you ask me?

388
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,557
I'm a schoolteacher.

389
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,869
I didn't ask you.

390
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,075
But so am I.

391
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,389
Oh, in the city?

392
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,629
High school.

393
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,076
You teach high school in the city?

394
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,954
Why did you come back here?

395
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,997
T o see my folks.

396
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,720
They're beginning to slow down.

397
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,233
Another look.

398
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,992
That's all.

399
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,312
Well, I hope you have a nice visit.

400
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,159
Excuse me.

401
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,715
You wanna go to a movie
tomorrow night?

402
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,389
I don't like movies very much.

403
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,870
I mean, I see so many of them
on television.

404
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,116
How about your sister? Is she busy?

405
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,397
Oh, Stacey?
Stacey got married and moved away.

406
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,518
We don't see much of her
since she, uh, had her children.

407
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,395
And you got left behind?

408
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,675
Oh.

409
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,990
I forgot my galoshes.

410
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,473
Hey.

411
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,914
Oh.

412
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,752
- Thank you.
Uh, no offense.

413
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,038
I was just looking for a little action.
I thought maybe you might be too.

414
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,191
Maybe I'll see you, Nick.

415
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,872
Excuse me.

416
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Excuse me.

417
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,275
Oh, come on, Rachel,
we'll miss the beginning.

418
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,235
I'm a sleepwalker.

419
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,676
Have you by any chance
had yourself a little nipsy on the sly?

420
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Sure.

421
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,877
First, an encounter at Shabab's.

422
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,077
And then home to the cooking sherry,
that's me.

423
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,077
Nothing's real.

424
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,355
Nothing is now.

425
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,512
If somebody pinched me,
I wouldn't even hurt.

426
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,950
I don't know, I've only got one life.

427
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,558
I say to myself, "Oh, maybe next time
this or that comes around, I'll grab it. "

428
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,678
But nothing ever comes around again,
ever, does it?

429
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,076
Don't chicken out.
It's nothing to be afraid of.

430
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,514
I know myself. I can't make...

431
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,956
You don't know anything about yourself.
Trust me.

432
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,989
Welcome, brother.

433
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,912
Lean on the Lord.

434
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,116
Calla, good to see you.

435
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,191
This is my friend, Rachel Cameron.

436
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,715
How are you?
Two seats right over there.

437
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,233
Love, baby.

438
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,311
- What?
- Love.

439
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,432
It's for you.

440
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,071
I'm sorry.

441
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,279
I don't know why I'm laughing.

442
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,431
Laughter's beautiful, baby. Be free.

443
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,029
Brothers and sisters!

444
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Calla.

445
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,634
Shh. I'm right beside you.

446
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,836
Brothers and sisters...

447
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,470
...I'm just standing here...

448
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,596
...feeling so...

449
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,672
...blessed...

450
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,879
...and I have to tell you why.

451
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,754
I can't keep the joy inside me.

452
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Listen to me.

453
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,958
Those of you who were here
one night last winter...

454
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,270
...remember that we had a visitor.

455
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,793
- Yes.
Yes.

456
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,430
A man who brought God
right into this room.

457
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,468
Brought the voice of the living God...

458
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,269
...right into this room
like a mighty rushing wind.

459
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,873
Praise God.
- Praise God.

460
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,110
- Praise God.
- Praise God.

461
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,711
He's here with us again.

462
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,632
Hallelujah.
Praise the Lord.

463
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,473
That man is sitting right there.

464
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,712
Right back in that dark kitchen.

465
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,599
Oh, my God. I'm so grateful.

466
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,352
- Calla, who is he?
Do you love him?

467
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,476
He's so beautiful,
I can't even describe him.

468
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,949
And he speaks in tongues.

469
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,473
Praise God.
- He does what?

470
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,551
- He's got the gift of tongues.
Praise God.

471
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,994
Praise God.

472
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,514
Close the doors, please.

473
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,309
Please, everyone, sit down.

474
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,310
I've been a lot of places
and something's happening.

475
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,236
But something is beginning to happen.

476
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,548
And not just with kids but all...

477
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,911
All kinds of people, all ages.

478
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,991
All over.

479
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,477
Maybe for the first time
since Jesus Christ.

480
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,110
You see, there's this...

481
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,191
...tremendous...

482
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,832
...yearning...

483
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,075
...to be...

484
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,913
...words.

485
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,397
- Words.
- Words.

486
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,074
Words and walls. Walls...

487
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,434
...between us. Chasms.

488
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,635
The animals are less alone
with roaring...

489
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,475
...than we are with all our words.

490
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,279
How we suffer.

491
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,158
How we...

492
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,395
...languish in the deep
and lifeless dungeons of ourselves.

493
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,350
We're cut off from each other.

494
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,431
We're cut off from God...

495
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,192
...and each other.

496
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,875
Oh, what can we do?

497
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,758
Can't we be what we are?

498
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,309
Isn't that our first and final obligation?

499
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
To be more...

500
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,599
...and more what we are?

501
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,229
More and more the image...

502
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,393
...God made us? His? Mine? Man's?

503
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,834
Look at your neighbor.

504
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,839
The human being in front or next to you
that you don't know. Look in his eye.

505
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,228
Now, who is he?

506
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,999
He's you.

507
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,038
And you're him
and you're both suffering...

508
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,637
...because you can't say what you want
to each other. What do you want to say?

509
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,388
What do you feel?

510
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
Love.

511
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,274
Say it again.

512
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,998
Love.

513
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,513
Oh, say it, people.

514
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,193
Say it.

515
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,839
- Love.
Love.

516
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,672
Praise God.

517
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,671
With all your hearts, people, love.

518
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Love.

519
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,399
Do you know what that is
to say that here?

520
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,236
In this life?

521
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,835
In this world?

522
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,038
It's happening.

523
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,634
Love that is given by God through us
to one another...

524
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,669
...the greatest gift of the spirit,
don't you feel it happening?

525
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,831
Don't you love the Lord
with all your hearts?

526
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,798
- Y es.
Love the Lord.

527
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,473
Come out in front, old man.

528
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,993
Will you help him, please?

529
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,878
And you, will you help her?

530
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,598
And you, come right out here.

531
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,275
And you, ma'am.

532
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,832
Go on.

533
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,078
And you?

534
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,352
- No.
You mustn't be afraid.

535
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,557
Are you so frightened of a hand?

536
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,119
No.

537
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,032
It's only a hand.

538
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,192
It won't harm you, don't you know that?
Five...

539
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,591
...fingers to hold with, to hold on with.

540
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,671
Would you hold onto me?

541
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,029
I think you want to. Be willing, please?

542
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,037
Please allow what you're feeling.

543
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,515
The door is open.

544
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,836
Love.

545
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,112
Say it with me. Love.

546
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,192
It's just a word, don't be embarrassed.
Say it. Love.

547
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,239
- Love.
- Love.

548
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,156
Again, love.
Love.

549
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,469
Again, love.

550
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,199
Will you all stand, please?

551
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,916
Join hands.

552
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,995
Join hands in an endless chain of love
that our living God can pass through.

553
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,715
Oh, my friends...

554
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,998
...I believe the Lord is here this
very minute wanting to help us.

555
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,480
Oh, please, Lord...

556
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,430
...please free these people
from all their suffering.

557
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,234
The Church of the Apostles...

558
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,109
...this very Church did indeed enjoy...

559
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,636
...and practice to the fullest
every gift of the spirit.

560
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,110
Y eah.
Every gift of the spirit.

561
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,558
Now there are diversities of gifts
but given by the same spirit.

562
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,395
For the one is given by the spirit
the words of wisdom.

563
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,519
Praise God.
To another the gift of healing.

564
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,639
To another the working of miracles.

565
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,315
To another diverse kinds of tongues.

566
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,391
Praise God.
Oh, Lord...

567
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,834
- ... above!
- Praise God.

568
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,192
Oh, Lord, Lord above!

569
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,318
Love me. Love me.

570
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,879
Love me. Love me.

571
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,439
Love me. Love me.

572
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,556
Love me. Love me.

573
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,835
Love me. Love me.

574
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,639
Love me.

575
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,234
Love me.

576
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,551
Are you all right?

577
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,312
Please. Say something to me.

578
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,638
Talk to me.

579
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,316
Say my name.

580
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,038
What happened?

581
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,353
Nothing.

582
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,511
Nothing bad.

583
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,355
I was on the floor.

584
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,919
Nothing bad happened.

585
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,275
Honestly, Rachel.

586
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,672
I... Was I loud?

587
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,637
Did it take long?

588
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,155
It was a couple of minutes maybe.

589
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,311
- But was I loud?
- Oh, no.

590
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,916
It was just a tiny little voice,
you could hardly hear it.

591
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,991
I don't believe you.

592
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,673
I am not a liar, Rachel.

593
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,389
In case you think God had something
to do with that, he didn't.

594
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,312
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

595
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,552
I didn't mean to snap, I just...

596
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
Oh, don't do that.

597
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,598
I feel so responsible.

598
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,751
I made a fool of myself.

599
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,478
Listen, we're all fools.

600
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,758
You can't be part of the human race
and not be a fool to somebody.

601
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,480
But I can't trust myself anymore.
I don't know...

602
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,755
Oh, honey, honey.

603
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,114
Honey lamb.

604
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,589
My poor honey lamb.

605
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,753
Oh, it practically kills me
to see you like this.

606
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,030
Oh, Rachel.

607
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,394
Oh.

608
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,028
Oh, I didn't... I didn't mean that.

609
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,191
Oh, God.

610
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,708
Oh, please.

611
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,154
Now I'm a fool.

612
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,831
I'm a fool.

613
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,589
The wind blows low, the wind blows high

614
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,591
The snow comes falling from the sky

615
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,478
Rachel Cameron says she'll die

616
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,710
For the want of the Golden City

617
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,950
She is handsome, she is pretty

618
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,190
She's the queen of Golden City

619
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,316
She is pretty, one, two, three

620
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,040
In the Golden City

621
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,634
Y o!

622
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,432
Rachel.

623
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,039
Is that...? Is that Nick Kazlik?

624
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,158
What are you doing? T aking a walk?

625
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,313
I'm going down to the river
to read a book.

626
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,754
How are you?

627
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,434
I'll tell you tonight
if you wanna take in a movie.

628
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,270
I'll have to check
with my social secretary.

629
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,034
You do that and I'll see you around 8.

630
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,508
Thank you.

631
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,999
What?

632
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,549
I said, okay.

633
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,676
Hi.
Hi.

634
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,478
How are you?

635
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,959
How do you do?

636
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,270
How do you double-do?

637
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,199
Will you be with me?

638
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,476
Do you promise to be with me?

639
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,870
Doctors can't make promises.

640
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,759
Just try to let the sedative
take its effect now.

641
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,353
Oh, to think, Jim...

642
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,954
...you'll be holding my heart
in your hands...

643
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,590
...actually holding it
in your two good hands.

644
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,478
Haven't I always done that?

645
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,715
Hello.

646
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,791
I'm sorry I didn't pull into the drive...

647
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,350
...but if I parked behind that hearse,
I'd feel like I was next in line.

648
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,114
Oh, listen, don't I know.

649
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,836
Crawl up here slowly.

650
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,592
Put your face against mine.

651
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,909
Now look.

652
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,071
There. In the corner.

653
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,434
My God.

654
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,079
It's not...

655
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,468
It's not even human.

656
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,552
- Thank you.
- That's to make up for taking me so long.

657
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,280
Didn't you get something for yourself?

658
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,554
Oh.

659
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,270
There's a technique to this because
these things go off like cherry bombs.

660
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,352
Now, if the manager hears,
no drinking on the premises.

661
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,033
That sort of thing.

662
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,512
So if it's a comedy,
wait until everybody's laughing.

663
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,038
But if it's quiet, the way it is now...

664
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,715
...you gotta create
your own diversionary action.

665
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,392
Ta-da.

666
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,270
Sorry, buddy, no drinking in here. Out.

667
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,440
- Out?
Out.

668
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,431
Oh, that's what I said, out.

669
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,031
Come on, you too.

670
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,235
- Cheers.
Cheers.

671
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,072
Cheers.

672
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,877
Here's to you and here's to me
and if we ever disagree, here's to me.

673
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,271
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, Nick, your
old man's been in here looking for you.

674
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,352
He kept hollering your brother's name.
Steve, Steve.

675
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,750
Well, next time,
tell him to look in the graveyard.

676
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,920
Nick.

677
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,038
Three times this week,
he's called me Steve.

678
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,792
That's awful.

679
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,234
Don't waste your sympathy.

680
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,595
The wily bastard's as lucid as I am.

681
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,880
It's part of a plot.

682
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,712
To make me take over the farm.

683
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,108
Aw, you're the bastard.

684
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,236
My heart really bleeds for him.

685
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,914
I hate cows, that's all.

686
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,559
I'm not my brother, okay?

687
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,756
Okay.

688
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,551
Cows.

689
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,873
I don't like the way they parade
around nude in mixed company.

690
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,715
I think they should either wear
brassieres, half-slips or go to jail.

691
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,472
What about you?

692
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,239
We really...

693
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,914
...go at each other
like mastodons sometimes.

694
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,757
We really tromp each other.

695
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,920
You and your father?

696
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,353
Well...

697
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,157
Don't you think people
that love each other usually...

698
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,435
Love?

699
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,274
I should have been the one
in the basket.

700
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,396
Father spiders and brother spiders.

701
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,039
We all have our share.

702
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,909
Sometimes even the ones
you think are gone are still with you.

703
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,476
When you step on a spider,
it wriggles till the sun goes down.

704
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,838
I don't know. I think that's snakes.

705
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,594
- It's the same thing.
- Oh.

706
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,875
I like you, Rachel.

707
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,031
Well, thank you, heh, heh.

708
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,914
Hey, Don, you wanna shoot me over
another beer?

709
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,518
Boy, when you look at a person,
you really look.

710
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,796
Was I staring?

711
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,910
Oh, right across to the wrong side
of the tracks.

712
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,158
What did you think of us?

713
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,831
Us bohunk kids way back then?

714
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,357
I envied you.

715
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,953
Why?

716
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,960
Did you think we spent all our time
getting laid?

717
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,635
And doing gay Slavic dances?

718
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,879
I've embarrassed you again.

719
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,793
Like when I said I was looking
for a little action. I'm sorry.

720
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,196
No, it's just that sometimes you don't
talk very much like a schoolteacher.

721
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,749
There aren't any second-graders here.

722
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,432
Let's dance.

723
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,955
Oh, I only do the box step.

724
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,879
You wanna go someplace with me?

725
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,477
Some place?

726
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,956
My mother has a rather uncertain heart...

727
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,157
...and she gets very worried about me
when I'm not home on time...

728
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,915
...so I think maybe the evening
had better be over now.

729
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,349
Mother spiders weave
very sticky webs too.

730
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,953
"I wanna go, I wanna stay.

731
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,159
He loves me, he loves me not. "

732
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,918
Should I make the big decision for you?

733
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,957
Please.

734
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,473
Thank you.

735
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,079
How polite and well brought up you are.

736
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,710
"Thank you. Please. " For everything.

737
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,956
It's very thoughtful of you
to have brought that along.

738
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,872
Hmm, that's me.

739
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,314
Gallant to the end.

740
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,391
- Have a seat.
- Heh, heh.

741
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,996
You have beautiful skin.

742
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,153
Thank you.

743
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,352
Touch me.

744
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,957
The moon's so bright,
I can see the cemetery.

745
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,831
Well, that grave's a fine and private place

746
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,992
But none, I think, do there embrace

747
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,188
What's wrong?

748
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,794
I just want it to be so...

749
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,757
Don't worry, love.

750
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,514
It's never much good the first time.

751
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,036
Is it so obvious, then?

752
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,236
Is what so obvious?

753
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,789
That it's the first time for me?

754
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,709
You don't have to play the virgin.

755
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,550
I'm not gonna go around
saying you're a whore.

756
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,639
Who's that?

757
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,394
Cinderella home from the ball?

758
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:31,834
Oh, you must've had a lovely evening,
dear, to have stayed out so late.

759
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,958
Well, we drove around.

760
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,509
It was a lovely evening.

761
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,228
Oh, I hope you didn't catch cold.
The wind seemed awfully chilly to me.

762
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,994
I opened the window and closed it again.

763
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,390
Uh, did you have to take your heart pill?

764
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,595
No.

765
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,149
And I forgot my sleepy-bye pill too.

766
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,159
I just feel so wide-awake
and bright-eyed.

767
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,953
Does it show?

768
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,588
Can a miracle happen and never show?

769
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,079
Rachel.

770
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,879
Look, honey, I'm not such
a whiz at saying things.

771
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,158
He didn't say "whiz"
and he didn't call me "honey. "

772
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,910
He said, "Fix yourself up
when you get home. "

773
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,193
That's all.

774
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,751
But how can I?

775
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,953
I can't just walk into the drugstore
and ask for, well, what I need.

776
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,515
Unless Mother has something.

777
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:48,279
Some antique rubber museum piece that
you can still smell the disinfectant on.

778
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,238
Oh, Nick...

779
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,834
...I know I didn't do well.

780
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,714
It couldn't have been very nice for you.

781
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,960
God, please.

782
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,951
Whoever you are...

783
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,914
...please let him see me again.

784
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,830
So I can make it up to him.

785
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,993
Just so I can cancel out the clumsiness.

786
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,672
Anyone seen that rotten thing that's on
at the Manawaka Theater this week?

787
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,796
" Not I, " said the Little Red Hen.

788
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,793
Florence,
I think you' re sitting on the pencil.

789
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:51,479
I always said that Claudette Colbert
was so sweet and natural.

790
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,312
And she always had such lovely hair.

791
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,040
And Marguerite Clark,
she was darling too.

792
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,998
Oh, that was years ago, Holly.

793
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,752
Years and years ago.

794
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,876
Well, it doesn't seem
years and years ago to me.

795
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,040
- Pass.
- Three hearts.

796
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,274
Yes?

797
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,759
Who is it?

798
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,319
Nick?

799
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,117
You're not exactly invisible, Calla.

800
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,558
I left you a note but it blew down.
It's by the step.

801
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,119
I just hadn't seen you around anywhere
so I thought something might be wrong.

802
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,757
No, I've just been kind of busy.

803
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,708
Yeah, well, I was just passing by.

804
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,591
Oh, Rachel...

805
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,438
...I've been so miserable.

806
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,072
Calla, it's my mother's bridge night.

807
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,518
I'd like to stay out and talk but I
really think I'd better go back upstairs.

808
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,310
You don't know what it's like.

809
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,236
AII I do is stare at the phone.

810
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,234
I know it won't ring
and I don't have the courage to call.

811
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,438
You build things up
out of all proportion.

812
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,669
I'm not asking you to go out...

813
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,831
...or even see me...

814
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,075
...but if we could have just one talk.

815
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,753
I mean...

816
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,998
...if this silence goes on,
it'll be impossible at school.

817
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,957
I don't see why.

818
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,148
You might as well give me my note back.

819
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,799
I told you all that was in it...

820
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,236
...and the rest of the confession,
you don't need.

821
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,238
You look wonderful.

822
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,118
You too.

823
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,870
Well, I'm just gonna take
that dirty old queen.

824
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,110
What do you think of them apples?

825
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,954
Are you gonna discard?

826
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,553
Oh, look, there's Hector.

827
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,631
Hello, Hector!

828
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,075
How's my favorite big gamblers
this afternoon?

829
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,559
Oh, we're scalding.

830
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,915
Can't you do something
about the humidity, Hector?

831
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,672
If you're a real friend, you would.

832
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,594
I have here two quarts
of ripple fudge ice cream in this bag...

833
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,433
...and I'd love to accommodate you girls
before it melts.

834
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,716
Thank you, Hector, but I'm a vanilla girl.

835
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,313
Or rather, I was.

836
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,790
Cold rich things on a warm day
only make you warmer, Hector.

837
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,871
I tried.

838
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,672
What's so funny?

839
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,548
Well, I finally wormed it out of him.

840
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,396
Why he smells so much nicer
than your father did.

841
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,753
He smells just like a pine tree, you know.

842
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,554
He told me that now
they're putting perfume...

843
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,995
...into the embalming fluid.

844
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,915
Pine, cedar, rose,
any pretty scent you like.

845
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,677
Your father always smelled
of formaldehyde.

846
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,716
Stuck to his clothes,
it clung to everything he touched.

847
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,190
Just like those nasty wolverines I read
about in the National Geographic.

848
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,558
They leave their stench on everything
they catch so that nothing else will eat it.

849
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,598
When he died
and we aired out the house...

850
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:35,390
...I realized that I hadn't taken
a decent breath in 25 years.

851
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:42,791
Did she think
he carried death upstairs with him?

852
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,520
Did she think it was catching?

853
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,919
Did I?

854
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,153
Well, I'm going to go down with three.

855
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,514
What do you mean, "was"?

856
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,636
Don't you like vanilla anymore?

857
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,315
No, as a matter of fact,
I think I probably hate it.

858
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,311
Hello.
- Mother, who is it?

859
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,629
Mother?

860
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,633
No, I'm sorry.
She's having her shower right now.

861
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,950
- Who's calling, please?
I'm coming. I'm coming.

862
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,314
Who's calling, please?

863
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,959
Just a minute. I'm coming.

864
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,516
He says it's a Dr. Timothy Leary.

865
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,036
- Hello.
Hello.

866
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,200
Oh.

867
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,713
Oh, hello.

868
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,996
My folks are away for the weekend...

869
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,276
...so I thought maybe you'd like
to play house.

870
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,873
We've got, like, three bedrooms...

871
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,953
...so we can chase each other
from room-to-room between, you know...

872
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,831
Y es, I ' d love to read that book.
It sounds very interesting.

873
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,956
Can you get it from the public library?

874
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,634
Oh, you can't talk, right?

875
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:01,119
Right, at this moment,
I'm Venus Observed.

876
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,077
I'll pick you up in an hour.

877
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,958
We can go to the store and stock up...

878
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:09,272
...and you can cook us huge meals
in between raptures.

879
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,557
I'd love to see that play at the university.

880
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,395
Uh, I hear it got excellent reviews.

881
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:21,076
The only trouble is, do you think
we could get back at a decent hour?

882
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,595
I'm not planning to take you back at all.

883
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,036
All we have to do is call your mother
and tell her something reassuring...

884
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,792
...like the car went over a cliff.

885
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,758
Oh, fine.

886
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,194
With you in it.

887
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,478
We don't wanna be too hard
on the old heart, right?

888
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,319
You're terrible.

889
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,391
Then what are you laughing for?

890
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,198
Goodbye.

891
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,514
Hey.

892
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,358
Wanna go up now?

893
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,112
All right.

894
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,073
Try to relax.

895
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,470
I am. I'm sorry.

896
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,277
- Nick.
- Shh.

897
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,069
That's a comfortable chuckle.

898
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,993
Are you gonna keep it to yourself
or let me in on it?

899
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,873
I was just...

900
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,632
...remembering...

901
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,917
...a poem that my father saved.

902
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:13,995
He used to save funny things that people
wanted to have put on their tombstone.

903
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,832
And this one was, uh:

904
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,152
Your days away don't piddle
At every season strive

905
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:25,235
For once you 're past the middle
You 're more dead than alive

906
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,711
Isn't that awful?

907
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,349
It's apropos of me.

908
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,352
I don't know, a guy drops dead
in the middle of a piddle deserves...

909
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,954
...to immortalize the moment.

910
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,758
I wanna say something
I've never said before.

911
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,239
What?

912
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,316
I'm happy.

913
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,116
You're just feeling smug
because you've improved a little.

914
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,191
You know what I wish?

915
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,112
For your sake.

916
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,953
So you wouldn't have all that worry
about your father, I've...

917
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,315
Have you ever considered
coming back here?

918
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,995
T o live and teaching here and...

919
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,559
Nick?

920
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,351
You stopped breathing.

921
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,191
For a minute, I thought...

922
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,918
Thought what?

923
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,031
When I like somebody...

924
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,758
...I get scared. I sometimes...

925
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,388
I dream about them
being already embalmed.

926
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:29,951
- If I hold onto you, nothing can happen.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

927
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,237
What time is it?

928
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,991
It's 10:00...

929
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,597
...and I haven't even fed you yet.
I'm a helluva host.

930
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,750
I can go downstairs...

931
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,275
...and make you an omelet.

932
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,431
Or whatever you want.

933
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,751
I don't know what you eat.

934
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,429
Nick, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to surround you like that...

935
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,635
...I was only joking.

936
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,119
I'm not breakable.

937
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,510
See? All in one piece.

938
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,995
It's just such a new experience,
having contact with anyone.

939
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,110
Just feeling you inside your skin is...

940
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,679
...over...

941
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,038
Just a few cents' worth of chemicals...

942
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,350
...is all that's under my skin
and a lot of water.

943
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,158
We're 90 percent water.

944
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,039
That's not all that's under your skin.

945
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,755
You're a loving person, Nick Kazlik.

946
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,434
Babe, we've only had two dates.
You don't know me at all.

947
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,113
I know enough.

948
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,396
I know enough to say...

949
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,080
...that I love you.

950
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,595
I want a child. I...

951
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,993
Look, I wanna show you something.

952
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,589
I think you should see this.

953
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,992
I am not God.

954
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,435
I can't solve anything.

955
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,872
May I borrow your bathrobe, please?

956
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,877
I'm sorry I didn't get
to cook you that omelet.

957
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,076
Well, you can do that the next time.

958
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,559
You mean that?

959
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,029
Do I ever say anything I don't mean?

960
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,880
Good night.

961
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,395
I'll see you, okay?

962
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,468
Don't forget to call
before the eggs get rotten.

963
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,751
Mother, I'm here.

964
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,753
What is it?

965
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,395
I had an attack, that's what is it.

966
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,674
Doctor said I might have died
from such a shock.

967
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,478
What shock?

968
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,669
It's on your bed.

969
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:20,755
Why didn't you get married
like a normal woman...

970
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,356
...and have children
like your sister Stacey did?

971
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,110
She watches the street
like a captain watches the sea...

972
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,750
...praying for a funeral to come by
and cheer her up.

973
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,996
And I wait...

974
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,752
...like Calla...

975
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,990
...for the phone to ring.

976
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,471
Oh, Nick.

977
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,913
Hello.

978
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,832
Hello. Who is speaking, please?

979
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,672
May I speak...

980
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,876
...to Mr. Nick Kazlik, please?

981
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,632
Nick no here.

982
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,148
Could you, uh...?
When do you expect him back?

983
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,880
Maybe Christmastime, maybe next year.

984
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,315
My son go away on Sunday.

985
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,631
Could you tell me where I could
reach him? Is he with his family?

986
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,552
Nick ain't got no family.

987
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,472
He never got married yet.

988
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,752
Who is speaking?

989
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,275
Who is speaking, please?

990
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,512
It's all right. I'm sorry.

991
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,039
Mother.

992
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,915
Can I buy you a drink?

993
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,193
What?

994
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,159
You looked like you could use a drink.

995
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,992
Are you all right?

996
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,400
Yes, I'm fine.

997
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,118
Mama too?

998
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,670
Yes, she's fine.

999
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:29,398
Well, I only ask because I haven't heard
too much talk up there lately.

1000
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,836
I was gonna ring the bell,
but, uh, I heard footsteps...

1001
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,956
...and the john flush.

1002
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,511
I didn't wanna be a butt-in.

1003
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,192
It's reassuring to know
that you're aware of us, Hector.

1004
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,399
Oh, well, hell, hell, I mean...

1005
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,553
Rye or sherry, name your poison.

1006
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,918
Rye.

1007
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,913
Wait. You wanna go inside?
I got air conditioning.

1008
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,318
No, I think out here.

1009
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,118
I've only been in there once and I...

1010
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:07,274
Now, you stay put.
You stay there and I'll be out in a flash.

1011
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,229
You came in.
Oh, Rachel, I'm really honored.

1012
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,319
Here.

1013
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,160
Let me know if it's light enough.

1014
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,877
It's fine.

1015
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,756
That's the first time
I ever saw you take a drink.

1016
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,357
Oh, I know you, you know.

1017
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,238
I'm an observer of human expressions.

1018
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,072
I've gotta be in this business.

1019
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,397
Hell, I'm the one who puts them there.

1020
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,039
I wanna tell you...

1021
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,236
...whatever the problem is...

1022
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,311
Uh, and I'm not asking.

1023
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,553
You know what you're like?

1024
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,188
You're like
one of those trick birthday candles...

1025
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:46,638
...that won't blow out no matter how
hard you try, they keep coming back.

1026
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,230
You got real guts, Rachel.

1027
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,554
Uh, do you like
what I've done to the place?

1028
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,279
Well, you certainly
have driven death away.

1029
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,556
Well, it's just a question of, uh...

1030
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,073
...well...

1031
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,231
...presentation.

1032
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,917
What am I selling?

1033
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,513
I'm selling relief.

1034
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,511
Did I tell you about relief?

1035
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,955
- Not yet. Ashes?
- Ashes.

1036
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,430
Did I tell you that I bought
a super-duper upright organ...

1037
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,750
...that plays all by itself?

1038
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,077
- What, Rachel?
- Nothing.

1039
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,037
Aw, what?

1040
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,113
What?

1041
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,510
I didn't know you could just go out
and buy those.

1042
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,318
How nice for everyone's wife.

1043
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,951
I'm sorry.

1044
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:56,395
You know, you really know how to
make me lose my train of thought.

1045
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,551
Hector, if a woman died...

1046
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:19,474
...while she was carrying a child,
what would you do about it?

1047
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,793
In what sense are you referring?

1048
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,711
Would you embalm them...

1049
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,075
...together or separately?

1050
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,432
You shock me, Rachel.

1051
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,068
That's a terrible question.

1052
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:38,597
I hope it was a purely scientific one.

1053
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,873
I'd like to see where you do it.

1054
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,316
In the name of God,
what are you doing?

1055
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,835
Get up. Come on. Get up.

1056
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,070
Get up out of there. Come on. Get up.

1057
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,159
May.

1058
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,073
May.

1059
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,872
May!

1060
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,156
Come take her from me.
She's been in the room.

1061
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,437
Don't stand there, woman.
She has to be scrubbed right away.

1062
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,918
Hector...

1063
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,039
...would you mind putting
your arm around me?

1064
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,270
Not at all.

1065
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,632
Oh, God.

1066
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,189
I wish I wasn't losing my hair.

1067
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,351
Hector, things like that don't matter.

1068
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,272
- Oh, they do, they do...
- No, they don't.

1069
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,874
...if you're getting bald.

1070
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,758
They do.

1071
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,429
Hector, help me.

1072
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,755
How?

1073
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,992
Sometimes I can't even tie my shoelace.

1074
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:49,039
I think I've done something
that's going to finish my mother.

1075
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,434
You oughtn't to tell me things like that.

1076
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,071
I don't know. I don't know anything.

1077
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,749
If I gave you the wrong advice,
can you imagine?

1078
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,749
But you know.

1079
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:06,712
Oh, the only thing I'm good for...

1080
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,918
...is to tell you where to go to have it...

1081
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,479
...you know...

1082
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,393
Killed?

1083
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,557
Who is it?

1084
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,352
It's me, Rachel.

1085
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,635
Rachel?

1086
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,318
Have you any idea what time it is?

1087
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,477
Well, it's 3:00.

1088
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,391
I think that's a helluva nerve.

1089
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:14,636
Well, I'm a very drunk,
very pregnant lady and I need a friend.

1090
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:29,271
I'm out of saccharine,
can you stand sugar?

1091
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,192
I just take milk.

1092
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,635
You know, if I think about...

1093
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,951
...having it...

1094
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,553
...without considering anybody else...

1095
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,996
...it just seems like...

1096
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,475
What? Finish it.

1097
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,916
More than anything I could hope for
in my whole life.

1098
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,269
Without Nick?

1099
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,270
Oh, he wasn't real.

1100
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,757
I made him up.

1101
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,554
But it's living there, all by itself.

1102
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,074
Inside of me.

1103
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,708
I never thought anything...

1104
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:15,079
...alive could ever grow in me.

1105
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,477
You think I could?

1106
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,517
You think I'd dare?

1107
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,198
If you did...

1108
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,551
...this could be
the first decision you made...

1109
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,359
...that showed any respect for yourself.

1110
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,031
Mrs. James?

1111
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,514
You look like a healthy woman,
blood pressure's normal.

1112
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,874
Your heart's still beating.

1113
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,315
That's... That's nice.

1114
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:25,316
Whoops.
We don't want that cotton anymore.

1115
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,794
Okay?

1116
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,234
Chicago? I know Chicago.

1117
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,153
Where's Cannon Street?

1118
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,393
It's, uh...

1119
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,314
Oh, it's just out by the lake.

1120
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,631
One of those ritzy
North Side neighborhoods, huh?

1121
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,472
I guess so.

1122
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,392
Any complications so far?

1123
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,118
- No, should there be?
No.

1124
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,033
- Thirty-five is just a little late to start.
- Oh.

1125
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:57,834
Now, let's lie down.

1126
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,877
What...?
- It's all right, just lie down.

1127
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,040
That's it.

1128
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,077
Try to think of his college education.

1129
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,151
Now, try to relax.

1130
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,839
I am. I'm sorry.

1131
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:15,192
All right, now try to relax now,
Mrs. James.

1132
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,830
Okay, you can sit up now.

1133
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,153
You all right?

1134
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,828
I'm afraid Junior's not planning
to visit you just yet...

1135
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,797
...but I'm glad you came in
when you did.

1136
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:11,995
What do you mean?

1137
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,718
It's not what we thought it was.

1138
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,757
There's something there,
it's causing the symptoms...

1139
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,512
...and it ought to come out.

1140
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,349
What ought to come out?

1141
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,556
It's just a small cyst.

1142
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,870
It's nothing to be concerned about.

1143
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,032
Is that all?

1144
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,270
It couldn't be anything else.

1145
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,352
I'm sorry, Mrs. James. Would you like
to be left alone for a minute?

1146
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,752
Oh, God.

1147
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,750
Rachel Cameron says she'll die

1148
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,114
For the want of the Golden City

1149
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,554
Lazy Mary, will you get up?

1150
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:31,720
Will you get up?

1151
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,472
Rachel, is that you out there?

1152
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,596
Come on, wide-awake now.

1153
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,988
Good morning, Rachel dear.

1154
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:40,038
You keep pining for a life of your own...

1155
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,988
...but somehow, with you and her,
it always turns out to be bridge night.

1156
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,833
Where are you?
I'm counting. One's used up now.

1157
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,831
That's a girl. Come on, now.

1158
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,150
You know what happens
when I get to three.

1159
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,953
Two.

1160
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,157
Two and a half.

1161
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,151
Two and three-quarters.

1162
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,232
The operation is over.

1163
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,436
You' re out of danger.

1164
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:09,472
How can I be out of danger
if I'm not dead?

1165
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,630
You'll be all right.

1166
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,436
Well, just look at you.

1167
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,398
All fed and rested.

1168
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,238
Would I ever love
to change places with you?

1169
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,032
Oh, before I forget.

1170
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,237
I brought the stationery like I promised.

1171
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,072
And I forgot something. What else?

1172
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:36,516
Mother, I don't like to plunge into this
like this...

1173
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:40,070
...but there's just...
Is no graceful way of doing it.

1174
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:43,755
Calla helped me to apply
for a teaching job in Oregon...

1175
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,674
...and I was accepted.
And I'm moving there next month.

1176
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,354
Oh...

1177
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,239
Drat. I forgot the stamps.

1178
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:00,596
- I forgot the stamps.
- Would you stop fidgeting in your bag...

1179
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,399
...and look at me for once, please?

1180
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,237
Did you hear what I had to say?

1181
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,918
It's too silly to hear.

1182
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,871
It's not silly.

1183
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:16,359
- If you want a little change, I...
- I don't want a little change.

1184
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,876
There's no reason to be moving.

1185
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:21,759
Move. Why?

1186
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,836
Because it's time.

1187
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:31,114
Now, I have already gotten my ticket...

1188
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:35,558
...and if you want to go with me,
I'll give you the money for yours.

1189
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,711
We'll discuss that when you get home,
you know.

1190
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,229
You'll get to see your grandchildren.

1191
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,950
I don't want to move, Rachel.

1192
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,033
Then don't.

1193
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:04,353
- You know I can't be left alone, that's...
- Then come with me.

1194
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,035
Doctor doesn't want me to exert myself.

1195
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,794
All you'd have to do is get on a bus.

1196
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,515
I don't want to, Rachel.

1197
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,956
Please! Please. Please.

1198
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,556
You don't want to what? You don't
want to go or you don't want to stay?

1199
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,719
I don't want to.

1200
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:37,434
You're the cruelest thing that ever lived.

1201
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,951
Don't you care what happens to me?

1202
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,593
After all those sleepy-bye pills...

1203
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,639
...and chocolate bars
and sandwiches and walks...

1204
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,836
...can you ask me that?

1205
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,917
Yes, I care.

1206
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,712
But I can't keep you alive.

1207
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,757
That's not up to me.

1208
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,038
Never was.

1209
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,630
Would I have to sell my furniture?

1210
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,593
Couldn't I even take my room?

1211
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,748
Y es, you can take your room.

1212
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,873
You can take anything you like.

1213
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,472
Mother. Mama.

1214
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:30,755
Mommy.

1215
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,992
All the way back.

1216
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:38,280
Such a long, sad, lonely, awful time.

1217
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,271
The moment comes.

1218
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,395
I'm always pushing things
out of their cages.

1219
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,478
Calla.

1220
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,673
Sometimes I wish
I could've been different for you.

1221
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,274
Y eah, well, don't go making
a fool of yourself.

1222
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,192
You know how you feel about fools.

1223
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:27,035
Maybe I'm proud to be one.

1224
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,273
Calla.

1225
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,158
Take care.

1226
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,353
I hope you find what you want.

1227
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:57,388
Not to worry. I'll survive.

1228
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,920
The wind blows low, the wind blows high

1229
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,911
The snow comes falling from the sky

1230
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,832
Rachel Cameron says she'll die

1231
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,230
For the want of the Golden City

1232
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,516
She is handsome, she is pretty

1233
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,989
She's the queen of the Golden City

1234
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,991
She is pretty, one, two, three

1235
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:35,549
In the Golden City

1236
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,790
The wind said, " When?"
The wind said, "Soon "

1237
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,394
The dream comes flying from the moon

1238
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,232
Rachel Cameron sings the tune

1239
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,073
At the gates of the Golden City

1240
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,390
They are happy, they are pretty

1241
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:50,358
All who dwell in the Golden City
They are happy...

1242
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,273
Where I'm going anything may happen.

1243
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,716
Nothing may happen.

1244
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,155
Maybe I'll find a friend.

1245
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:08,350
Maybe I'll even marry
a middle-aged widower...

1246
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,829
...and have children in my time.

1247
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,519
Most of the chances are against it...

1248
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:19,069
...but not, I think, quite all.

1249
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:26,431
It may be that my children
will always be temporary...

1250
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,511
...never to be held.

1251
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,676
But so are everyone's.

1252
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,915
I will be afraid.

1253
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:44,832
Always.

1254
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,192
I may be lonely always.

1255
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,757
What will happen?

1256
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,310
What will happen?

1257
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,031
