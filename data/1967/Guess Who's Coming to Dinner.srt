1
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,042
You know, I just had a thought.

2
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:35,673
I'll go check in a hotel and get
some rest, and you go find your folks.

3
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,969
Let's go meet them. The sooner
it's over with, the better.

4
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,306
Mom will be out to lunch.
Dad's at his office.

5
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:47,226
- You may not meet them till dinner.
- You may be wrong about them.

6
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,937
You should've told them
we were coming.

7
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,399
It may be the biggest shock
of your young life.

8
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:58,321
After 23 years of living with them,
don't you think I know them?

9
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,448
I hope so.

10
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,742
There's no problem.

11
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,382
We'll be a minute, then we'd
like to go to Claremont Drive.

12
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,176
All right.

13
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,310
I'll see if Mom's in the office.

14
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,320
- Joey?
- Hilary, hi. How are you?

15
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,822
What a surprise!

16
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,992
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Okay.

17
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,586
- Strange.
- One of Hilary's favorites.

18
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,674
- It's called a kinetic sculpture.
- A what?

19
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,260
Look.

20
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,097
Why, isn't that someth...?

21
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,104
- What are you doing here?
- I thought Mother might be here.

22
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,858
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Prentice.
- I'm so pleased to meet you.

23
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,319
Pleasure to see you.

24
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,366
Christina's lunching with Mr. Cazelet.
I can ring up.

25
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,785
Just tell her I'm back
and that I'll be home.

26
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:32,039
Has something happened?
Is anything wrong?

27
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,543
Something's happened,
but everything's right.

28
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:41,132
- How was Hawaii? Was it fun?
- Hawaii was simply unbelievable.

29
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,387
Do you live in San Francisco, doctor,
or are you visiting?

30
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,307
Just passing through.
It was a pleasure to have met you.

31
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,184
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

32
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,670
Hilary runs the gallery,
but it's Mom who has all the ideas.

33
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,840
Her idea to put originals
in hotel rooms is brilliant.

34
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,469
Gives people time
to decide if they like them.

35
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:31,599
The hotel gets free decor, the guests
can look at good paintings...

36
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,352
...the painter can make a sale,
and Mom gets a commission.

37
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,354
Take the next right.

38
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,358
- Isn't that clever?
- That is clever.

39
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:28,072
- What do I owe you?
- Ten-fifty, Mac.

40
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,991
Twelve bucks, right?

41
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:37,373
Right.

42
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,375
John, come meet Tillie.

43
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:47,174
Tillie, this is Dr. Prentice.
John, Miss Matilda Binks.

44
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:52,680
Pleased to meet you, Miss Binks.
I've heard a great deal about you.

45
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,643
What are you doing home unexpected?
You told them you're back?

46
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:02,231
I left a message for Mom.
It's lovely to see you! I missed you.

47
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,901
Why are you home?
You want those bags upstairs?

48
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:10,739
- Not my two. I've not come to stay.
- I'll tell you all about it.

49
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,450
You eat any lunch yet,
or are you expecting it now?

50
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,330
Could you make us sandwiches?
We'll have it on the terrace.

51
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,148
Do you like it?

52
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:49,778
- It's beautiful.
- Come out and look from the terrace.

53
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,037
- What?
- Hey, who's that?

54
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,711
That's Dorothy. Isn't she a knockout?
She helps Tillie during the week.

55
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,131
- Which days?
- Never mind.

56
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,349
- I ought to call my folks.
- Use the phone in the study.

57
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,518
- Will you introduce me?
- Not on the phone.

58
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,104
- Won't you tell them?
- I'd rather write.

59
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,775
I have to meet them
before I come to Geneva.

60
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,654
Or will we keep our marriage
a secret from them?

61
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:35,324
Why didn't I think of that?
See, that's a thought.

62
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,078
I'll shut this in case Dorothy
goes by.

63
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,742
Los Angeles, please. Area code 213.

64
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,704
Axminister 246-99. Time and charges.

65
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:26,500
I've got a right to my own opinions,
and you want my opinion?

66
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,045
I don't like one of my race
getting above himself.

67
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,507
If I ever want your opinion,
I'll ask for...

68
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:37,761
Oh, Tillie, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

69
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,807
But you can't mean what you're saying,
and you're so wrong.

70
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:45,019
You're the last person I'd expect...

71
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,646
...to take such a silly attitude.

72
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:52,026
I've always loved you,
and you're just as black as he is.

73
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,821
It's right for me to love you
and wrong to love him?

74
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,116
Just stop and think about that.

75
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:04,538
- What's for dinner tonight?
- Celery soup and rump steak.

76
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,583
Come on! Turtle soup and tournedos.

77
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,252
And one of your best pies?

78
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,629
It's Mom!

79
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,425
Joey? Darling?

80
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,053
- What the hell? Joey?
- Mom!

81
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,014
Darling, are you all right?

82
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,932
Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!

83
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,644
I rang the gallery to tell Hilary
that Cazelet had agreed to...

84
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,814
He has? That's marvelous!

85
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:35,444
She thought you might have a surprise.
What did she mean?

86
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,530
Do I hear someone?
Is there someone here?

87
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,160
Mom! I've never been so happy
in all my life! I'm just...

88
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,871
Bursting. I can see that.

89
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,832
I'm feeling happy for you.
Do I know him?

90
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,127
I only met him myself 10 days ago.

91
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,130
You won't believe
what's happened in 10 days!

92
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,927
I might, if you'd pipe down
long enough to tell me.

93
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:04,723
- Wonderful things have happened in...
- Mom, he's so wonderful.

94
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,394
I've never known anyone like him.
Never known anything like this.

95
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:12,314
I fell in love with him in 20 minutes!

96
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,234
Well! That was quick.

97
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:21,448
Dad, I wanted to stop on the way back,
but time got so short...

98
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,700
...and I've got to get to work.

99
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,831
I don't understand why
you couldn't spend one day with us.

100
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,419
Well, fact is, Dad, I met this girl.

101
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:38,006
You met a girl? Why didn't you say so?
Mary, he's met a girl.

102
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,343
That's good news.
Does she live in San Francisco?

103
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,679
Yes. I'm at her house now.

104
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:48,725
He's at the girl's house now.
Where did you meet her, Hawaii?

105
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,187
Yes. And I wanted to meet her folks.

106
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:57,401
- That sounds good, I mean, serious.
- Yes. It's serious.

107
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,364
- This is quite a surprise.
- She's surprising in a lot of ways.

108
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:07,286
- Your mother says, "Is she pretty?"
- Yes, she's pretty.

109
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,665
Your mother says, "How old is she?"
What's the difference?

110
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,461
- She's only 23, Dad.
- Twenty-three, that's good.

111
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,924
You're 37, that's just right.
Women age faster than men.

112
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:26,555
- You reckon to marry the girl?
- We've been talking about it, but...

113
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,810
Dad, there's one or two problems,
you see...

114
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:38,400
...that I'll write to you about
on the plane to New York tonight.

115
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,652
All right?

116
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:45,324
He's so calm and sure of everything.

117
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,119
He doesn't have any tensions in him.

118
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,331
He knows what he believes
and what he thinks is right...

119
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,709
...and why, and where he's going.

120
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,963
Mom, there's one thing I must tell you.

121
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,092
He was married before,
and he had a son.

122
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,970
It was so tragic.

123
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,226
His wife and son were killed
in a train accident eight years ago.

124
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,896
And John...

125
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,357
I haven't even told you his name.

126
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:25,906
It's John Wade Prentice.
Isn't that a lovely name?

127
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,367
John Wade...

128
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,204
Joanna Prentice, I'll be.

129
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,542
But, Mom. Mom?

130
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,044
There's something else...

131
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,881
...that John's been very deeply
concerned about.

132
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,760
He's been worrying if
you and Dad would be upset if...

133
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,474
Well, it's about time.
I was wondering where you'd been.

134
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,687
Mom, this is John.

135
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,442
Doc... Doc... Dr. Prentice?

136
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,238
I'm so pleased to meet you.

137
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,783
I'm pleased to meet you, Mrs. Drayton.

138
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,953
Joanna's already
busted out with the news.

139
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:17,874
She has told me a good deal,
and all very quickly too.

140
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:24,381
She's only known me for 10 days,
so she can't tell when I'm blushing.

141
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,551
That could be another problem for us.

142
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:35,058
I'm medically qualified, so I hope
you won't think it presumptuous...

143
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,270
...if I say you should sit
before you fall down.

144
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:42,149
He thinks you're gonna faint
because he's a Negro.

145
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,734
Well...

146
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,945
I don't think I'm going to faint.

147
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,700
But I'll sit down anyway.

148
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,167
Can't we all sit down?

149
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,059
Well, I...

150
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:22,564
I suppose it would be all right
if I said, "My goodness," wouldn't it?

151
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,359
Well, my goodness.

152
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,655
- Do we mind her saying "My goodness"?
- I don't mind.

153
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,908
- Did you tell them about me?
- Yes.

154
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:38,121
They said I sounded serious and asked
if you were pretty. I said yes.

155
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:42,542
They said this was a big surprise.
I said it was.

156
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,004
Did you tell them I'm not
a colored girl?

157
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:51,551
I didn't. It was shocking for the phone.
People will think we're shocking.

158
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,639
- Isn't that right, Mrs. Drayton?
- I know what you mean.

159
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,937
- Tillie's made food. Let's go outside.
- Yes, let's.

160
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,982
- Come on, Dr. Prentice.
- I'll explain it in two minutes.

161
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,444
John was lecturing
at Hawaii University.

162
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:14,408
We met at the dean's party,
and afterward we went for a drive.

163
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:18,662
Since then, we've been
somewhere together every night.

164
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,583
John was flying back to Los Angeles
on Saturday to see his parents.

165
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,210
That's where they live.

166
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,005
Thank you, Tillie.

167
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,429
Try one of these. They're great.

168
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,848
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

169
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,017
- Does your father know you're back?
- Not yet.

170
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:45,981
- Do you think he'd come back early...?
- Yes, he's playing golf.

171
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,444
Marvelous! He'll meet John
and we can all talk over dinner.

172
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:55,031
John's flying to New York tonight
to see a friend at Columbia.

173
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:59,703
Tomorrow he's flying to Geneva
for the World Health Organization.

174
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:04,040
I'll fly to Geneva next week
so we can be married.

175
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,253
- That's the whole situation.
- In a nutshell.

176
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:13,842
Except he thinks the fact he's a Negro
and I'm not creates a serious problem.

177
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,302
Does he?

178
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:19,639
I've told him that it wouldn't
matter to you or Dad.

179
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,018
He won't believe me.
That's why we're here.

180
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:29,316
That's why he watches you so closely
while pretending not to at all.

181
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:36,239
She's right. I'm sorry. I told her
not to spring this on you so suddenly.

182
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,036
You can tell your father
you met someone in Hawaii...

183
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,997
- Now, really!
- Give him time to adjust...

184
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:48,460
But what for?
He still has to be told, doesn't he?

185
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:54,090
You should make up your minds
because that's his car.

186
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,430
- Mr. Matt?
- Hi, Tillie.

187
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,059
- All hell's done broke loose!
- The waste disposal?

188
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,269
It ain't that.

189
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:10,690
- What happened? Where's Christina?
- On the terrace with Joey...

190
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,193
...and someone called Dr. Prentice.

191
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,780
Doctor? What's wrong?
What's happened?

192
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,323
Joey?

193
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,035
Here he comes.

194
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:25,580
- Daddy!
- What's happened?

195
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,293
- Tillie said there was a doctor...
- Dr. John Prentice. This is my dad.

196
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,796
- Pleased to meet you.
- How are you?

197
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,424
- Is something wrong?
- I decided to come home early.

198
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:41,012
We met in Hawaii and flew back today.

199
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:46,476
Sit down. I thought something
was really wrong. Tillie said...

200
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,813
Tillie's behaving very strangely.
Coffee?

201
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,775
No, thanks. I'm playing golf
with Monsignor Ryan.

202
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:57,153
How are you? What's the matter?
Are you having a chill?

203
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,532
No, darling. I'm fine, I...

204
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,160
Doctor?
Are you practicing in San Francisco?

205
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:09,124
- Sit down.
- No, sir. I am just here for one day.

206
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,127
Where is your practice? Hawaii?

207
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:17,257
No, I'm not established
in any one place.

208
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,927
I'm in tropical medicines,
mostly in Africa.

209
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:25,557
- That sounds interesting.
- Everything about him is interesting.

210
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,977
I'm sure. I wish I had more time.

211
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,938
- Excuse me...
- Couldn't you stay and talk?

212
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:37,027
I'd love to, but I'll be late.
I'll see you later, doctor?

213
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,572
- You certainly will.
- Good.

214
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:45,368
- Dr. Prentice will be here for dinner.
- Fine. Then you can tell me...

215
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,830
And there's a great deal to tell,
isn't there?

216
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,878
Fine. See you all later.

217
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,865
What the hell is going on here?

218
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,077
- This doesn't make sense.
- I told you.

219
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:32,290
What? If you don't explain
what you three are playing at...

220
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,877
- I can explain it.
- You can? Let's have it.

221
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:41,508
Well, it's my fault. You see,
we have a sort of a situation here.

222
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:48,223
We didn't just meet in Hawaii.
We spent a lot of time together.

223
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,768
I mean, all the time after we met.

224
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,272
And, well, we have this problem.

225
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,608
I fell in love with her.

226
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:07,909
And as incredible as it may seem,
she fell in love with me.

227
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,162
And we flew back to San Francisco...

228
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:16,209
...to see if either of you had
any objections if we got married.

229
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,466
Joanna told her mother
as soon as she walked in.

230
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:28,346
I had the stupid idea
that maybe there was some way to...

231
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,642
...break this gently.

232
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,705
- Daddy, you're making us nervous.
- Am I?

233
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:59,002
I wouldn't want to make anybody
nervous. Chris, are you nervous?

234
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,088
Sit down, doctor,
before you make me nervous.

235
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,927
Would anybody like coffee?

236
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:13,141
What did she say
when Joanna told her?

237
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,312
- Did she raise any objections?
- None so far.

238
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,230
What objections?

239
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:23,526
I know this is a shock,
because it's all so unexpected.

240
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,613
I never thought I'd
fall in love with a Negro...

241
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,492
...but I did, and nothing in
the world will change that.

242
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:36,122
Even if you were the governor
of Alabama, I wouldn't let him go.

243
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:40,335
I mean, if Mom were.
So tell him, will you?

244
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,798
Tell John if you have objections,
then you can play golf.

245
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,675
What is it you expect me to say?

246
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,762
You have to give me time
to think about this.

247
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,598
You certainly have got a problem.

248
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:58,311
If you're expecting a sensible
statement, I need time to think.

249
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:03,191
- Does that sound reasonable?
- Yes, but not quite practical.

250
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:09,239
You see, Matt, there's sort of
a special problem.

251
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:14,119
I'm flying to New York tonight,
and on to Switzerland tomorrow.

252
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:19,082
Yes, and what Joey proposes
is to go to Geneva herself...

253
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,585
...so they can marry
in the next few weeks.

254
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,798
- What the hell's the rush?
- We know we want to get married.

255
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,635
Unless there are objections,
why should we waste time?

256
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,680
John and I aren't
gonna change our minds.

257
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,224
Are you telling me...

258
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:41,104
...that you want an answer today
about how your mother and I feel?

259
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,357
Yes. We want you and Mom to state...

260
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,193
...that you have no
objections whatever.

261
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,822
And when we do marry,
we'll have your blessing.

262
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,627
- Are you gonna play golf, or no?
- No.

263
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,422
I'll call it off. Excuse me, doctor.

264
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:18,600
- And that's my dad. Do you like him?
- I don't know. Does he like me?

265
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:24,022
With his American-eagle face,
no one can tell what he's thinking.

266
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:28,318
I don't think he liked any of us
after the way we began.

267
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,528
Give John more coffee.

268
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:35,450
She's beautiful, Joanna.
She's even better-looking than you.

269
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:40,622
Hello, Edie?
Two things, Edie, both of them urgent.

270
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:44,500
Call up Monsignor Ryan,
tell him I can't play today.

271
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,005
Tell him something's come up,
something personal at home.

272
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:53,718
Then call the library and see what
they have on a John Wade Prentice.

273
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:58,556
Prentice. A doctor of medicine,
fellow of about 35, 36.

274
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:02,101
- Oh, Matt!
- He's a colored fellow.

275
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:07,148
If they haven't got anything,
call up the Medical Association.

276
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:10,985
Get anything you can.
Hurry it up and call me back.

277
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,948
- There's no necessity for that.
- It can't do any harm.

278
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:19,744
But, Matt! Joey said he was lecturing
at the university in Hawaii.

279
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,039
Did it ever occur to you
that this might happen?

280
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,626
No.

281
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,046
Never occurred to me either. Not once.

282
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,175
Tell me your reaction.
How do you feel?

283
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:38,513
I don't know. I was shaken at first.
I still am, I suppose.

284
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:43,268
But they mean what they're saying.
They know what they're doing.

285
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:48,898
They may mean what they say, but
they don't know what they're doing.

286
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:56,823
- If I'm not intruding?
- Of course not. Please come in.

287
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,951
I'd like a couple of minutes
with the two of you, if I may.

288
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,870
Sure, doctor. Come on in.

289
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:09,711
There's something you both
ought to know. I made a decision.

290
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,548
Joanna doesn't know about it,
and she shouldn't.

291
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,925
What is it, doctor?

292
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,971
Joanna thinks that our future
is settled...

293
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,890
...but there is no real commitment.

294
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,644
Up to now, nothing is settled at all.

295
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:31,274
I don't understand. She said you'd
marry no matter what we think.

296
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,110
That's not the case.

297
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,781
Unless you two approve,
there won't be any marriage.

298
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:44,954
Why, John?
Why have you decided that?

299
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,459
Mrs. Drayton,
this happened so quickly...

300
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,712
...I'm just as startled
as you must be.

301
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,798
Two weeks ago it'd be inconceivable.

302
00:27:57,051 --> 00:28:01,304
But two weeks ago
I had not met Joanna.

303
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:06,934
She's not at all
like anyone I've ever known.

304
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:11,105
It's not just that our color
difference doesn't matter to her.

305
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:15,693
It's that she doesn't seem to think
there is any difference.

306
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:23,868
This has come up at a time
when I have all the problems I need.

307
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:29,332
I can't afford to get married if it
meant taking on special problems...

308
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,085
...in addition to those we'll have.

309
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:38,174
When you say "special problems,"
doctor, what do you mean?

310
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,051
Well...

311
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,809
Your attitude, Mr. Drayton...

312
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,686
...and yours, Mrs. Drayton.

313
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:54,107
Joanna is very close to both of you.

314
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:58,778
If marrying me damaged
her relationship with either of you...

315
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,906
...the pain of it
would be too much for her.

316
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,452
I wouldn't know how to deal
with that kind of situation.

317
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,414
I wouldn't want to try.

318
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,335
I'm glad you told us this.

319
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,675
Don't misunderstand me.
I love your daughter.

320
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:25,012
I'd do anything to keep her
as happy as the day we met.

321
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:30,268
But it seems that without your approval
we will make no sense at all.

322
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:34,105
That is why I am asking
for a clear statement...

323
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,441
...of what your attitude will be.

324
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,612
I appreciate that, doctor.

325
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:45,199
It's almost in the form
of an ultimatum.

326
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,870
Not quite, Mr. Drayton.

327
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,706
All you have to say is "goodbye. "

328
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,963
Well, that's where it's at.

329
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:03,509
Thank you for the opportunity
to speak my piece.

330
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:14,145
Well? Still think you ought
to have someone check on him?

331
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:18,191
- No.
- He's right about Joey too.

332
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,318
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

333
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:24,405
Thank God. That's how I feel,
thank God he's right.

334
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,073
She's 23 years old...

335
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:30,286
...and she is exactly how
we brought her up to be.

336
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:34,373
We answered her questions.
We told her it was wrong...

337
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:39,337
...to believe that white people
were superior to black people...

338
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,507
...or brown, or red, or yellow ones.

339
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,343
People thinking that way were wrong...

340
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:50,598
...sometimes hateful, usually stupid,
but always, always wrong.

341
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,351
That's what we said.

342
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,313
And when we said it, we did not add:

343
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:01,400
"But don't ever fall in love
with a colored man. "

344
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,991
- Edie, Mr. Drayton.
- What is it, Edie?

345
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:13,454
He's an important guy.
Born Los Angeles, 1930.

346
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,666
Graduated maximum cum laude
Johns Hopkins, '54.

347
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,502
Assistant professor,
Yale Medical School, '55.

348
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,630
Professor at London School
of Tropical Medicine.

349
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,925
Assistant director,
World Health Organization.

350
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:30,846
Two textbooks and a long list
of Medical Society honors.

351
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:35,309
Married Elizabeth Bowers 1955,
one son: John Wade.

352
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,397
Both killed
in an accident in 1959.

353
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:44,235
- There's a lot more here.
- No, that's all right. Thanks.

354
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:03,379
- What's the $2.20?
- He called his parents in Los Angeles.

355
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:07,633
I guess he doesn't bum
free telephone calls either.

356
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:11,137
I understand why
he didn't talk about himself.

357
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,806
Who the hell would believe him?

358
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:24,567
- I beg your pardon, lady.
- Loves me, loves me not.

359
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:27,945
Well, what do you think?

360
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:31,907
- Aren't they the way I said they were?
- They're special...

361
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:36,996
Shall I tell you something?
For a whole week, I've been nervous.

362
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,415
No. I don't believe...

363
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,877
Just about their first reaction.

364
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:47,465
I thought they might let me down
for the first half-hour.

365
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:51,886
You're a phony, you know that?
You're a big phony!

366
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,847
I'm not a phony.

367
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,870
Well?

368
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,667
She's always been
a happy human being.

369
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:27,338
She laughed out loud
before she was 6 months old.

370
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,008
She was happy as a baby,
happy as a little girl...

371
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:34,345
...happy all through school
and college.

372
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:43,104
But I don't think I've ever seen her
quite so happy as she is right now.

373
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:49,193
And I have to be happy
for her, Matt...

374
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:51,278
...and I am.

375
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,992
I feel happy for her.

376
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:02,081
And proud of the fact
that we helped to make her.

377
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:07,712
And whatever happens now,
I feel glad that Joey is Joey.

378
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,742
How are you today?
Having a steak fry?

379
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,412
Well, now, there she is.
How are you today?

380
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:45,833
- Give me a lift to Market Street?
- You know it, doll!

381
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,961
I hope it's better
than the last we had.

382
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:52,131
I just deliver it,
I don't rustle the cattle.

383
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,301
You said to remind you
to open the wine.

384
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:30,461
Civil rights is one thing.
This here is something else.

385
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:35,591
I went out onto the terrace.
Oh, it was so beautiful.

386
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,552
It was dark and the moon was rising.

387
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:43,098
I didn't see him because of the view,
but he was standing there.

388
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:46,602
Then, all of a sudden,
he moved, and I jumped.

389
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:52,441
And he just stood there,
looking at me, and sort of...

390
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:57,154
- You're burning your shirt.
- Oh, yes. Sort of smiling.

391
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,616
"Hello," I said.
"Who are you?"

392
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:05,162
And I think he thought I was,
you know, attractive.

393
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:11,794
Finally he said, "Well, do you think
it could possibly matter?"

394
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:16,382
- And it's just crazy, and I admit it...
- You'd better let me do this.

395
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,803
But 20 minutes later
I felt I was in love with him.

396
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,765
Mom, how long did it take you
to fall in love with Dad?

397
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:28,978
Well, nothing so long as 20 minutes!

398
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:33,524
Is that really true? Oh, Mom!

399
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:38,362
I wanna ask you something.
How deeply are you and John invol...?

400
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,281
No, I have no right...

401
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,784
Do you mean
have we been to bed together?

402
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:47,621
I don't mind you asking me that.
We haven't.

403
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,457
He wouldn't.

404
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:54,628
He couldn't have doubted
my feelings, but he wouldn't.

405
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,630
You're burning my shirt.

406
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,844
He's been concerned the whole time
about my getting hurt somehow.

407
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:07,933
They're still talking. You'd think
everything was said by now.

408
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,937
You say they don't have
any special sense of rhythm?

409
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,564
That's right.

410
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:19,111
But you can see it. You can't turn on
the TV without seeing kids dancing.

411
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:23,866
- The colored kids are better.
- But there's an explanation.

412
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:28,287
It's our dancing and our music.
We brought it here.

413
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,374
You can do the watusi,
but we are the Watusi...

414
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,376
...if you know what I mean.

415
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,546
When I was your age,
my sports editor told me...

416
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:41,467
...that Negroes would never
be able to play baseball.

417
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:46,180
Willie Mays could be elected
mayor of San Francisco.

418
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,434
I own a newspaper, but I couldn't
be elected dogcatcher.

419
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:55,105
You don't want that any more
than he wants to be mayor.

420
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:57,983
No, I suppose that's right.

421
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,864
Doctor, we've talked about
a good many things...

422
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,575
...but there's one we haven't.

423
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:10,287
Have you considered the problems
of your children?

424
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,874
Yes, and they'll have some.

425
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:18,629
We'll have children,
or you couldn't call it a marriage.

426
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,006
Is that the way Joey feels?

427
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,469
She feels that our every
child will be president...

428
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,847
...and they'll all
have colorful administrations.

429
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:36,730
Well, you made her, Mr. Drayton.
I just met her in Hawaii.

430
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,859
But how do you feel
about that problem?

431
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,238
Frankly, I think your daughter
is a bit optimistic.

432
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,783
I'd settle for secretary of state.

433
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:55,708
Would you think it cowardice
if I told you that...

434
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,628
...no matter how confident you are,
I'm scared?

435
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,840
No, it wouldn't.

436
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,427
But you never know.
Things are changing.

437
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:11,015
They're not changing anywhere
as fast as in my own backyard.

438
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:15,561
Tell me this. Don't you think
this quick decision...

439
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,606
...about how we feel
is just a little unfair?

440
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,191
In a way, I do.

441
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:29,491
But it wasn't my idea that
everything be settled so quickly.

442
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,286
Your daughter said there's no problem.

443
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:37,124
"My dad's a lifelong fighting
liberal who loathes race prejudice...

444
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,460
...and fights discrimination. "

445
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:43,881
She said, "My parents
will welcome you with open arms. "

446
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,427
And I said,
"Oh, I sure wanna meet them. "

447
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,265
John! Telephone, it's Los Angeles.

448
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:57,561
- Take it in my study.
- Thank you.

449
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,995
- Hello. Yes, this is he.
- Dr. Prentice?

450
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,414
- Hello.
- Hi, Dad.

451
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:21,126
- Dr. Graves call again?
- No, it's not that, son.

452
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:27,091
I had an idea. What would you say
to us flying there for the evening?

453
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,052
- This evening?
- Could be there at 6:30.

454
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,764
I thought we could
take you both out...

455
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,350
- Invite them to dinner.
- Just a minute.

456
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,228
Dad, I'm having dinner with her folks.

457
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,897
- They're invited!
- That the young lady?

458
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:46,568
That's her. Just a minute.
You haven't asked your mother...

459
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:52,032
Mr. Prentice, will you come to dinner?
John and I will meet your plane.

460
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:55,285
- Who am I talking to? John?
- Hi.

461
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:59,873
Looks like she wants us, even if you
don't. We certainly wanna meet her.

462
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,418
- So we'll see you at 6:30.
- Oh, no, no.

463
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:08,507
Your mother says she's pleased.
Hell, he knows that!

464
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,886
- All right, son. We'll see you later.
- Dad? Dad!

465
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,516
What's the matter with you?

466
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,477
- Mom!
- Yeah?

467
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,564
John's parents are coming to dinner.

468
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,316
Good. Marvelous.

469
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:30,070
- We'll meet their plane at 6:30.
- Fine. Tell Tillie.

470
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,947
Okay.

471
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,993
Joanna, I told you.
My folks, they don't...

472
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,371
- They think you're colored.
- Why didn't you tell them?

473
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:42,875
- I was gonna write.
- What difference is it?

474
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,003
You think they won't come?
Call and tell them.

475
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:51,633
- They'll know when I go meet them.
- I'll meet them.

476
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:57,306
- It gives me a chance to explain...
- Why do you dramatize everything?

477
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,101
We're meeting Peter and Judith
for a drink at 5:30.

478
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,854
There's time to get to the airport.

479
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:08,233
She's my best friend.
You've just got to let them meet you.

480
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,574
- Did he tell you about his plan?
- No. What?

481
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,493
It's the damnedest thing.

482
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:24,124
They put a medical school on trucks,
run into some African country...

483
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,711
...pick up the brightest
native kids...

484
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:31,757
...and give them courses.
Like the U.S. Army Corps.

485
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:37,221
His idea is that they're all
specialists trained to do one thing.

486
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:42,684
Like sewing up a wound,
or delivering a baby, what have you.

487
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:46,813
They go where people never heard
of an aspirin...

488
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,066
...let alone a doctor.

489
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,777
Imagine what that means.

490
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:57,407
For every 1000 kids they train,
they can save a million lives a year.

491
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,870
He seems to have made
quite an impression on you.

492
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:07,042
I asked him how he got so far.
He's only 37.

493
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:10,837
He said he thought
he got the best breaks...

494
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:15,550
...because no one wanted him
to think they were prejudiced.

495
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,304
Yeah, he made an impression.
I couldn't fault him.

496
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:22,516
- Are you trying to fault him?
- Of course not.

497
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:27,229
You know his father's a mailman?
Retired in Los Angeles.

498
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,899
How do you suppose
a colored mailman...

499
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:34,778
...produced a son
with all the qualities he has?

500
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,739
- You'll find out this evening.
- What?

501
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,161
- Guess who's coming to dinner.
- Who?

502
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,247
You mean... His parents?

503
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,084
Now, wait a minute.

504
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,380
- Whose idea was that?
- Joey invited them.

505
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:57,301
We're being pressurized.
You know that, don't you?

506
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,054
First there was no marriage
unless we approved.

507
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,807
Then we had one day to decide.

508
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:09,271
Now we're entertaining somebody
we've never heard of! What the hell...?

509
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:19,239
Don't look at my baby pictures.
That's at Klosters the year...

510
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:22,034
I'll get it, Tillie. Just a second.

511
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:31,168
- Monsignor Ryan, how wonderful!
- Good afternoon.

512
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,920
But why are you here, not in Hawaii?

513
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:38,175
What problem caused your father
to chicken out of golf?

514
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:42,721
- And who is this gentleman?
- This is Dr. John Wade Prentice.

515
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,058
We met in Hawaii
and we're gonna be married.

516
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:50,270
Are you indeed?
I take it you mean to each other?

517
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,230
- Dr. Prentice.
- Monsignor.

518
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,816
- Of course, you're the problem.
- Yes.

519
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,402
I'm afraid I am.

520
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,489
Why haven't your parents
informed me?

521
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,908
They didn't know either.

522
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:07,954
Excuse me a second,
I forgot to tell Tillie something.

523
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,668
- I suppose this was all very sudden?
- Yes.

524
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:18,840
- Have you two had time to consider it?
- No, we've not.

525
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,593
We'll be two more for dinner.

526
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:25,305
- How many steaks?
- I got four. I was told four.

527
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:29,267
Order two more because
the doctor's parents are coming.

528
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:33,271
- His father and mother, here?
- That's right.

529
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:36,691
If the butcher can't send them,
send a taxi.

530
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:40,570
It's more like a Holy Rollers'
meeting every minute.

531
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:46,284
Of course! I know about you. I read
an article about you in Commonweal.

532
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:49,287
I shall want to talk
to you about that.

533
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:53,417
Are you aware this fellow's
a very important man?

534
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:57,712
Wholly aware of it.
When we're married, I'll be important.

535
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:01,007
I daresay you will,
as a matter of fact.

536
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:04,136
- Where's Arnold Palmer?
- In the garden.

537
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:07,681
Just go on with what you're doing.
Fore!

538
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,685
Of all our friends, he's the closest.

539
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,437
We're not Catholics...

540
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:18,066
...but he and Dad and Mom
sat on committees and things.

541
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:21,820
He's a wonderful man, and we love him.

542
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:28,201
You're a remarkable fellow, Mike.
You get younger every minute.

543
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,663
- Did you?
- Yes! I've just seen him.

544
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:35,750
Handsome fellow.
Little Joey's nothing less than radiant.

545
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,004
It warms me chilly old heart
looking at her.

546
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:44,593
- Aren't you a little shocked?
- Shocked? Why should I be shocked?

547
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:48,722
I've known many cases
of marriages between races.

548
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:53,602
Strangely enough, they usually
work out well. I don't know why.

549
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,397
Maybe because it takes
a special quality of effort.

550
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,649
More consideration, compassion...

551
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:03,695
...than most marriages
generate these days.

552
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:07,699
- Could that be it?
- Yes, it could.

553
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,409
I'm glad you said that.

554
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:14,247
That's a beautiful thought.
You do have beautiful thoughts.

555
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,250
It's my trade, you know.

556
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:23,298
What about laddie over here?
You making heavy weather of it?

557
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:27,010
You know, this man is quite
a famous fellow.

558
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,640
He's done incredible work in Asia
and some awful place in Africa.

559
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,893
Mom! Hilary's here.
She wants to see you.

560
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:41,483
Excuse me. Express some more
beautiful thoughts to the lad.

561
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,114
Thank you.

562
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:53,745
I hope you won't think I'm prying,
but, naturally, one is curious.

563
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:54,996
Naturally.

564
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:59,042
Dr. Prentice and I
are gonna be married, Hilary.

565
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,294
Are you?

566
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:05,257
I didn't even know.
Christina hadn't even mentioned it.

567
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:09,427
- She didn't know. It was a surprise.
- A surprise?

568
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,013
Well, I should think it was!

569
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:17,477
Joey tells me congratulations
are in order. You didn't even know.

570
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:29,656
What's the problem, Hilary?
What brings you up here?

571
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,784
Mr. Cazelet phoned about the...

572
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:37,622
Oh, that. Excuse us, will you?
I'll walk out to your car with you.

573
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,083
I hope I'll see you shortly.

574
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:45,338
Dr. Prentice is leaving tonight,
and Joey within the next two weeks.

575
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:49,217
Then you must permit me
to wish you every happiness.

576
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,511
Come along, Hilary.

577
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:59,436
Christina! My poor dear,
what a shock for you.

578
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:04,357
I knew something was up, but this?
What are you going to do?

579
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:07,485
- The child is of age...
- Yes, the child is 23.

580
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:11,990
Why didn't you simply ring up
with the Cazelet information?

581
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,868
I must admit, I was intensely curious.

582
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:20,081
I couldn't believe it. It's unlike
Joey to do anything so stupid.

583
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,418
- Come along.
- What you must be going through!

584
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,962
You must try not to worry about it.

585
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:32,052
I have some instructions. Go back
to the gallery. Start your motor.

586
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:36,014
Tell Jennifer she'll
look after things temporarily.

587
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,267
She's to call if there's
anything she needs.

588
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:46,107
Then go into the office and make out
a check for the sum of $5000.

589
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:50,987
Then carefully, Hilary,
remove absolutely everything...

590
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:54,449
...that might remind me
you were ever there...

591
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:58,953
...including the yellow thing
with blue bulbs you like.

592
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:03,500
Then take the check for $5000,
which I feel you deserve...

593
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:07,545
...and get permanently lost.

594
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,423
It's not that I don't
want to know you...

595
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:14,135
...it's just that we're not
the sort of people...

596
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:17,013
...that you can afford
to associate with.

597
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:20,600
Don't speak, Hilary, just go.

598
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:31,069
You see that boy? If he'd played his
cards right, you'd never met me.

599
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:35,448
- He fell for some girl from Pomona.
- That'll teach him.

600
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:40,286
You know what Hilary was doing?
She was being an absolute bitch!

601
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:43,081
I wish you'd fire her, I really do.

602
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,668
Joey! How can you be so hard?

603
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,463
She has a ruthless streak, John.
Be warned about it.

604
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:53,675
She gets it from her father.

605
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,469
They need all the help
you can give them.

606
00:50:56,721 --> 00:51:00,014
They're gonna have
special difficulties...

607
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,976
- Christina.
- Don't budge, please. Sit.

608
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:08,481
Of course, they know all that.
They're serious, intelligent people.

609
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,734
If they know what lies in store...

610
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:14,112
...and want each other
enough to accept it...

611
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,198
...then they love each other
very much.

612
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:20,410
Any two people
who love each other that much...

613
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:24,080
...deserve all the best luck
in the world.

614
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:28,460
I don't know. I have the feeling
that they'll never make it.

615
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,504
That the whole thing's impossible.

616
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,176
You feel that way, do you?

617
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:39,429
You're really thrashing about, then.

618
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:43,725
That's very interesting, indeed.
And rather amusing too...

619
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:48,938
...to see a broken-down phony liberal
facing his principles.

620
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:54,277
I always believed that under
the fighting liberal façade...

621
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:58,406
...there must be a reactionary bigot
trying to get out.

622
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:03,745
Oh, go to hell. You and your crowd
are still preaching hell.

623
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,122
Well, I'm off.

624
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:12,170
As much as I enjoy your discomfort,
I can save a few souls before supper.

625
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:17,133
But I am, as it happens,
free for dinner...

626
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:22,764
Please come, 7.30. The doctor's
family are flying up from Los Angeles.

627
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:27,519
Well, in that case,
you'll actually need me.

628
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:31,648
Otherwise, you won't even
outnumber the blacks.

629
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:35,109
Thank you, my dear.

630
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,654
Half past 7.

631
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,156
What was that the Beatles sang?

632
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:55,713
- Mom did it. Does it look like him?
- He looks a little grim...

633
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:59,717
- Hey!
- No, no. Don't let me disturb you.

634
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:03,680
I hope you don't mind,
but I'm coming to dinner.

635
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,683
- I'm delighted you're coming.
- Thank you.

636
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:11,896
I'm very delighted to have met you.
See you this evening.

637
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,858
You know, you two make me feel...

638
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:18,695
...quite extraordinarily happy.

639
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:28,454
I'd better tell Tillie. Listen, you'll
hear her going through the roof.

640
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:37,839
I've brought you the latest bulletin.
Guess who's coming to dinner now.

641
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:42,051
- The Reverend Martin Luther King?
- Oh, Tillie.

642
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,429
You're so close. Monsignor Ryan.

643
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,932
Bake a second pie.
He loves your cooking.

644
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:53,062
Is the big guest room in order?
Dr. Prentice wants to have a shower.

645
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:57,692
- He does?
- He does.

646
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:04,157
She's 23. She has the right
to do as she pleases.

647
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:08,494
- That's not the point. He said...
- I know what he said.

648
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:13,041
Could we go for a few minutes?
What are the others doing?

649
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,170
Meeting Peter and Judith,
then going to the airport.

650
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,838
Come on!

651
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:22,258
Well, come on, will you?!

652
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:40,485
What happened to Homer, that lawyer?
I thought she liked him a lot.

653
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:44,197
Nothing happened.
Dr. Prentice happened to Joey.

654
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:48,368
Only last Christmas she said
Homer had the inside track.

655
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:54,207
That's where we got the ice cream.
Let's get some.

656
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:58,586
- Oh, Matt, it's after 5!
- A little ice cream can't hurt!

657
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,648
Yes?

658
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:24,237
When I had ice cream before, I had
a special flavor I liked very much.

659
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:27,156
- I can't remember.
- I'll bring the list.

660
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,409
You must know what it is.

661
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,829
Daiquiri ice, honeycomb candy,
cocoa-coconut...

662
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:36,332
...mocha jamoca, peanut butter,
banana mint?

663
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:40,461
- Must've been another place.
- Fresh Oregon boysenberry.

664
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,422
That's it. That's it.

665
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:48,052
That's it. Fresh Oregon boysenberry.
Bring me a big one, huh?

666
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:50,888
- Will you have some?
- No, black coffee.

667
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:55,977
One double fresh Oregon boysenberry
and one black coffee. Thank you.

668
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,318
You know, Matt...

669
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:08,197
...I think Mike was right,
that Joey is lucky.

670
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:12,076
The work he does is so important.
She'll be able...

671
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:16,289
...to share it all with him.
It's the best break.

672
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,709
For us it's all been great.

673
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:23,671
But do you know what was
the best time of all?

674
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,923
The beginning, when we struggled.

675
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:30,678
You were working too hard and
worried, sometimes frightened.

676
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:35,808
And there were times when I felt,
when I really knew...

677
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,977
...that I was a help to you.

678
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,980
That was the very best time
of all for me.

679
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:47,904
- Okay. One black coffee.
- Thank you.

680
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:52,450
- And one Oregon boysenberry sherbet.
- Thank you.

681
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:08,591
This is not the stuff.
I never had this before.

682
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:21,229
You know, it's not bad at all.
I kind of like it.

683
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,607
Fresh Oregon boysenberry.

684
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,150
Yes, sir?

685
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,279
When I had ice cream before,
this isn't the stuff I had.

686
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:33,282
But I like it, it's very good.
I like it very much.

687
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,159
Okay.

688
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,673
- How do you do, Miss Binks?
- I got something to say!

689
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,426
Just exactly what
are you trying to pull here?

690
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:56,222
I'm not trying to pull anything.
I was finding me a wife.

691
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,432
Ain't that just likely?

692
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:02,728
What kind of doctor are you
supposed to be?

693
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,022
Would you believe horse?

694
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,402
You make with witticisms and all, huh?

695
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:14,574
You may think you're fooling these
folks, but you ain't fooling me.

696
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:20,496
You're a smooth-talking, smart-ass
niggers out for all you can get...

697
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:24,250
...with all that other
trouble-making nonsense.

698
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:29,172
I brought up that child,
and ain't nobody gonna harm her.

699
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:33,759
As long as you're here,
I'm watching. You read me, boy?

700
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:38,222
You bring trouble, you'll know
what "black power" means!

701
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:42,768
And furthermore, you ain't even
all that good-looking!

702
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:55,990
That was good. If I come again,
remind me about the boysenberry.

703
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,702
Yeah, I sure will. Thank you, sir.

704
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:07,543
- Shall we take some home for dessert?
- No. Tillie's baked pies.

705
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:20,264
You stupid idiot!

706
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:27,104
- Can't you look where you're going?
- Your car's so low, I couldn't see it.

707
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:31,359
Of course you didn't see me!
You weren't looking!

708
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,613
- Look what you did!
- Okay, it's my fault. My insurance...

709
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:40,409
Who cares about your insurance?
I worked three months on that!

710
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:46,040
- How much to have it repaired?
- Look at it! Thirty or 40 bucks.

711
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:50,670
Stupid old man! You ought to be
put away in a home.

712
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:54,715
There's 50. Don't bother
to have it fixed. Buy a new one!

713
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:59,095
Some of these old guys,
they're senile!

714
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,639
Stupid old man!

715
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:06,852
There ought to be a law!
There ought to be a law!

716
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:16,988
What the hell is it today?

717
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:20,533
Less than 12 percent of this city
are colored.

718
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:26,122
I can't even have a dish of Oregon
boozenberry without running into one!

719
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,333
I can't tell you how happy
I am for you.

720
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,085
It all happened so quickly.

721
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:17,298
It took Peter and me three years
to get married.

722
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,300
We lived together for two.

723
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:26,098
- To John and Joey.
- John and Joanna.

724
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:31,354
- He only calls me Joanna. I like it.
- To John and Joanna.

725
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:36,776
You know, where you're so lucky
is in Joey's folks.

726
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:42,073
Matt Drayton really
stands for something in this town.

727
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:47,495
- It's always been a good paper.
- And he made it that way.

728
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:51,999
Matt takes a stand on all
public issues.

729
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:56,921
- When are you flying over?
- As soon as I can arrange everything.

730
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:00,674
Why aren't you flying over with John?

731
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:03,135
Why am I not flying over with you?

732
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:07,807
- Why am I not flying with you?
- Is your passport in order?

733
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:10,684
- Need anything?
- I could get it there.

734
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:15,564
Then it seems crazy to go all that way
when you could go together.

735
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:19,443
- Why don't you both leave tonight?
- Why not?

736
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:20,778
Yes.

737
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:39,296
It's 6:00. In an hour they'll be here.
The doctor leaves at 10:45.

738
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:44,343
No matter what it is, you
have to tell them how you feel.

739
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:48,264
I need more than one day
to make a decision like that.

740
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,976
It's the silliest thing.
But I'll say this:

741
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:56,856
I won't try to pretend
that I'm happy about it. I'm not.

742
01:02:57,065 --> 01:03:01,235
If the doctor's decision depends
on that, then it's too bad.

743
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,863
I'm thinking only of Joey's welfare.

744
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:07,450
I have nothing against him,
but he's a grown man...

745
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:11,537
...and he behaved irresponsibly
by letting it happen.

746
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,498
Now he wants me
to approve a situation...

747
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:18,252
...when I know they'll
get their brains knocked out!

748
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:23,299
Sorry, that's the way I feel.
And I know how you're reacting.

749
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:26,594
You're so wrapped up
in Joey's excitement...

750
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,556
...that you are not behaving
in her best interest.

751
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:07,236
There's no reason not to go tonight.
You can understand, can't you, Mom?

752
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:13,075
My passport's in order, I don't need
anything. I can pack in an hour.

753
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:17,580
I'll be with him.
We'll be together the whole time.

754
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:21,458
Mom, they're here. I can see them.

755
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:25,546
They look like awfully nice people.
His mother looks lovely.

756
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,090
Break it to Dad for me, will you?

757
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:31,260
Well...

758
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:36,890
I should've called you back again,
because there is one thing I...

759
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:43,147
I've been meaning to write to you.
There's one thing I didn't explain.

760
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:47,943
And I'm afraid it's gonna
be kind of a shock.

761
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,953
If you see what I mean.

762
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:01,498
Mom, Dad, this is Joanna Drayton.

763
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,751
Joanna, my mom, my dad.

764
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,879
Mrs. Prentice, I'm so happy.

765
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,965
- Miss Drayton?
- Drayton, yes.

766
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,636
Mr. Prentice,
I'm very pleased to meet you.

767
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,434
I can explain.

768
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:24,605
I can imagine
what's going on in your mind...

769
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:28,233
...but we can explain.

770
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:33,030
- You can?
- Of course we can.

771
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,616
You have bags?

772
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:39,536
Of course you have bags.
Let's go get your bags.

773
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:42,039
Mama.

774
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,795
- What did your folks say?
- All's well.

775
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,799
- Did you talk with your father?
- To Mom, but she'll tell him.

776
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:56,345
- Tonight?
- I thought I ought to tell you.

777
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,807
This whole thing...
That's out of the question.

778
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:05,354
I couldn't do what you're doing, so
I don't understand how you'll do it.

779
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:09,942
You can't break their hearts
and then sit down to dinner.

780
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,653
Don't you think I know that?

781
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:18,283
I'll talk to the doctor after dinner.
Tell him exactly how I feel.

782
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:21,245
Matt, I'm not trying to argue.

783
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:24,498
There's nothing to say
that you don't know.

784
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:28,043
But it's important how wrong
I think you...

785
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:30,504
You're making the worst mistake...

786
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:35,134
I think you'll regret it
for as long as you live.

787
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:38,137
You're as wrong as you can be.

788
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:42,641
I'm thinking of her.
Even the doctor's gonna know that.

789
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:47,896
There's something else. I'm
surprised it hasn't occurred to you.

790
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:52,484
The doctor will accept it
because he's sensitive...

791
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:54,862
...and because he said he would.

792
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:59,908
But Joey won't. Your mistake is in
underestimating your daughter.

793
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:05,372
She'll fight you and every argument
you ever try to give her.

794
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,083
And one thing more.

795
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:12,963
Until today I'd never have believed
I could say such a thing.

796
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:17,050
But when she fights you,
and for what it's worth...

797
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,220
...I'm going to be on her side.

798
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:28,812
I never would've believed
I'd hear you say a thing like that.

799
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,606
Damn it.

800
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:35,360
- Can I get you another drink?
- No, thanks. I'll get it.

801
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,411
I wish we had more time...

802
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,331
What were you gonna say?

803
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:52,127
I was gonna ask Miss Drayton
how her parents reacted to...

804
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:55,881
- I wanted to ask that too.
- Please call me Joanna.

805
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:59,176
They were shaken. I don't think
I've seen them so surprised.

806
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:04,139
What really shook them was
that I wanted to marry anybody.

807
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:07,267
I can't blame them for being stunned.

808
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:12,397
Then you couldn't blame us
if we were a little stunned too.

809
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,609
It's not unreasonable
to suggest that...

810
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:19,321
...you two are behaving like
escaped lunatics.

811
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,573
Dad...

812
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:27,204
...this happened so quickly.
It's like riding a rocket.

813
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:30,833
We didn't plan it,
it just happened that way.

814
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:35,003
It's hard on Joanna's folks,
and it'll be hard on you.

815
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:41,301
If you have any objections,
you'd better raise them soon...

816
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:44,680
...because in exactly four hours
we'll be gone.

817
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:50,352
I can't list all my objections
in four hours. I'd need eight hours.

818
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:56,316
You've only got four hours, so you'll
just have to talk twice as fast.

819
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:15,168
- Christina!
- Hello, darling. How are you?

820
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:20,340
- Forgive me. I'm a little bit early.
- Come in.

821
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:24,219
I don't like to be
always repeating myself...

822
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,889
...but how long since I remarked...

823
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:30,601
...that you are the loveliest woman
I've ever known?

824
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:34,646
There is a kind of envy
that is in no way sinful.

825
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:37,316
That's what I've had for Matt.

826
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:41,945
- What can I get you to drink?
- I like Scotch.

827
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:45,657
- But aren't we drinking wine?
- Yes.

828
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:51,246
I'll have a drop of Scotch anyhow.
Equal amount of soda, please.

829
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,837
Thank you.

830
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:04,384
My dear, what's the matter?

831
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:13,310
We're in trouble, Mike.

832
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:17,064
We're in terrible trouble,
terrible trouble.

833
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:21,234
John told Matt and me
that he wouldn't marry Joey...

834
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:25,614
...unless we'd approve
with no reservations whatever.

835
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:28,158
Joey doesn't know he said that.

836
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:31,286
Now she's decided to go
with him tonight.

837
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:35,123
They're on their way
with John's parents.

838
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:39,836
Neither of them knows
that Matt has decided...

839
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,965
Matt has decided that
he can't approve.

840
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:47,427
That's not true.
Please tell me it's not true.

841
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:51,723
- Where is Matt?
- He's upstairs, changing. He's...

842
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,518
He's not himself, Mike.

843
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,563
Excuse me.

844
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,900
It's incredible!

845
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:15,539
- Table all right?
- It's fine, Tillie. Thank you.

846
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:19,001
Miss Christina,
what's gonna happen here?

847
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,795
I don't know, Tillie.

848
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:27,384
You and Mr. Matt gonna put a stop
to this damn nonsense foolishness?

849
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:30,804
Tillie, I don't want
to put a stop to anything.

850
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:34,099
He's a fine man.
He's a wonderful man.

851
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:37,019
And Joey is
very much in love with him.

852
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:40,522
And it isn't just
"damn nonsense foolishness. "

853
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:43,817
I tell you, the way you're talking...

854
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:46,987
...I don't understand nothing no more.

855
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:53,785
Nobody understands nothing no more.

856
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:58,665
No, I don't think you're butting
in about what doesn't concern...

857
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,001
Damn, blast!

858
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:05,964
I understand how you feel, Mike.
I understand how everybody feels.

859
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:11,053
But understand, they've boxed me
into a hell of a corner here.

860
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:16,016
And no matter what anyone says,
I won't behave irresponsibly.

861
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,936
I'm not gonna tell them
they can't get married.

862
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:24,649
But they have no right to expect me
to be happy when...

863
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:25,984
For God's sake!

864
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:30,197
You're about to destroy
all the happiness there is...

865
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,325
...in the happiest family
I've ever known.

866
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:37,454
- Have you any thought for Christina?
- Christina?

867
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,083
Have you any idea
of how she has behaved today?

868
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:45,378
She was all for it as though
there were no problems.

869
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:49,633
But there are no problems
they don't know about.

870
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:53,386
Christina respects Joey's judgment
more than you.

871
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:58,433
Come off it! If Joey came home
with some fuzzy-wuzzy and said:

872
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:03,480
"Mom, this is the man for me,"
Christina would say, "How wonderful!

873
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,733
Where will we get enough roses
to fill the Rose Bowl?"

874
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:10,487
I'm trying to remember
where I've seen you so angry.

875
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:13,824
When you took nine shots
on the 7th green.

876
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:20,122
- Could you get the hell out of here?
- I know why you're angry.

877
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:25,752
Not with the doctor, not with
Joey or Christina, not even with me.

878
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:30,257
- You're angry with yourself.
- You pontificating old poop!

879
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:34,845
You're angry because
suddenly you've been thrown.

880
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:38,473
You're the last man
I'd expect to behave this way.

881
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:43,895
You're not yourself! You don't know
who you are, or what you're doing.

882
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:49,151
That's your trouble. You've gone back
on yourself. In your heart, you know it.

883
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,445
I'll only take so much,
even from you!

884
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:57,325
For 30 years, there's been no man
I've admired or respected more.

885
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:59,619
You know that, Matt.

886
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:05,083
And for the first time in all those
30 years, I feel sorry for you.

887
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:07,294
Damn it, that's enough!

888
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:11,089
Are you really capable of putting
yourself in my position?

889
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:15,427
Unless you've got kids
of your own somewhere...

890
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:19,681
...how could you know how a father
feels in this situation?

891
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:24,311
You don't know! I know
they won't have a dog's chance...

892
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,606
...not here, not in the whole
stinking world!

893
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:32,319
They are this country.
They'll change this stinking world.

894
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,363
In 50 years, maybe, or 100 years...

895
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,408
...but not in your lifetime.
Maybe not even in mine.

896
01:15:38,618 --> 01:15:44,039
My dear friend, I wish with all my
heart you could be restrained.

897
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:48,627
If I were younger, to prevent you
from going downstairs...

898
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:52,297
...I'd make an effort
to wrestle you to the floor.

899
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:55,550
That'll be the day.

900
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:01,973
Is that the car? Did you hear a car?

901
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:09,814
- Mrs. Prentice. I'm Christina Drayton.
- How do you do?

902
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:13,652
How do you do?
I'm so pleased to meet you.

903
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:18,073
Let me take your coat and hat.
And yours, Mrs. Prentice?

904
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,993
How good of you to come
all this long way. Do go in.

905
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:26,039
- Did you tell him? Was he shaken?
- It was a surprise.

906
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:30,085
- Does he wanna talk to me?
- I'm sure he does, later.

907
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:31,836
Please come in.

908
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:35,966
- May I get you a drink?
- May I have some sherry, please?

909
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:40,387
- What a lovely room.
- John, would you be bartender?

910
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,722
Shall we sit over here?

911
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:45,934
- What will you have, Dad? Bourbon?
- Thank you.

912
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:50,981
- You have such a magnificent view.
- Thank you. Please sit down.

913
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,692
Sit down, Mr. Prentice.

914
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:02,617
- Did you have a pleasant flight?
- Very pleasant, thank you.

915
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:06,204
The view of the sunset
was breathtaking.

916
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:09,207
Only took 40 minutes.
Four hundred miles.

917
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:11,960
It's incredible, isn't it?

918
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:20,010
My husband will be down directly,
I think. He's upstairs changing.

919
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:24,681
And we have a friend coming to dinner,
Monsignor Ryan.

920
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:30,103
- They'll be down in a minute.
- Mrs. Prentice. Mom.

921
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:32,772
- Here you are, Dad.
- Thanks, son.

922
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:37,944
Are you Catholics, Mrs. Drayton?

923
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:42,282
No, we're not, Mr. Prentice.

924
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:47,412
We're nothing in particular.
Monsignor Ryan is an old friend.

925
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:51,082
Do you come often to San Francisco?

926
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:55,295
- I've got to talk to your father.
- There he is.

927
01:17:56,505 --> 01:18:00,050
Dad, I'd like you to meet
Mr. And Mrs. Prentice.

928
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:04,012
- This is my father.
- Mrs. Prentice, nice to meet you.

929
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:08,767
Mr. Prentice, happy to meet you.
May I present Monsignor Ryan?

930
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:12,771
- How do you do?
- Glad to meet you, sir.

931
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,856
- Are you tending bar?
- Yes.

932
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:18,443
- We're both drinking Scotch.
- Coming up.

933
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:22,781
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down, there, Mike.

934
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:31,331
- Did you have a nice flight?
- Very nice flight.

935
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,500
Only 40 minutes.

936
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,171
- Only 40 minutes from L.A.
- Terrifying.

937
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:41,841
You could talk
about flying to Geneva...

938
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:46,012
...because John and I hope
you'll come for the wedding.

939
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:49,724
Would anybody like to talk about that?

940
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:55,772
I take it they've told you
all about their plans.

941
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:59,359
Of course. It's only when you're
eloping that you keep it a secret.

942
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:02,404
I don't know about you, Mr. Prentice...

943
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:05,365
...but I think they're rushing it a bit.

944
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,743
It seemed that way to me too.

945
01:19:09,537 --> 01:19:13,665
- It seems like that to you too?
- That's right.

946
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:17,127
I'm certainly relieved to hear that.

947
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:20,171
I was beginning to think
I was the only one...

948
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:23,550
I would like Mrs. Prentice
to see the view.

949
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:26,052
What are you talking about?
What view?

950
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,263
From the terrace.

951
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:31,683
- Would you care to see the view?
- Yes, thank you.

952
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,478
Good. Excuse us.
Bring your drink, that's fine.

953
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:47,073
Mrs. Prentice, have you had any
chance to speak privately with John?

954
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:49,409
Well, no.

955
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:52,579
It's important you know
what's happened...

956
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,957
...and what I'm terribly
afraid will happen.

957
01:19:56,542 --> 01:20:00,712
May I explain the situation
to you, or try to?

958
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:04,841
- Yes, please. I wish you would.
- First I have to ask you...

959
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,261
Forgive my being so abrupt
and so direct.

960
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:11,222
Are you shocked by the fact...

961
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:15,268
...that John's involved
with a white girl?

962
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,312
Yes, surprised.

963
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:20,607
It never happened before.

964
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:25,195
I guess it never occurred to me
that such a thing might happen.

965
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:28,656
But it wouldn't be true
to say that I'm shocked.

966
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:31,826
Are you, Mrs. Drayton?

967
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:37,290
Well, I think I was at first,
this afternoon...

968
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,460
...because it came as a surprise
to us too.

969
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,671
But now I know how
they feel about each other.

970
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:48,259
Joey's very young, Mrs. Prentice,
but she's not a child.

971
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:54,265
And they're deeply
in love with each other.

972
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:02,815
Are you telling me that you'd
approve the marriage...

973
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:07,111
...but that your husband won't?
Is that it?

974
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,448
Yes, that's it.

975
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:12,992
My husband won't, either.

976
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:20,124
I wish there were more time,
just to adjust to the situation...

977
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:24,546
...but there just isn't any time.

978
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:28,341
If we're going to accept it...

979
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:31,678
...we'll have to trust the two of them...

980
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:35,056
...and accept that
they know what they're doing.

981
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:40,311
Mrs. Drayton,
my husband just won't do that.

982
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,946
They seem to be having
quite a conversation out there.

983
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:54,075
It might do no harm
if we had a few words, Mr. Drayton.

984
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:55,326
Yes, sure.

985
01:21:55,578 --> 01:22:00,248
We can go into my study.
Will you excuse us, please?

986
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:07,839
Doc, you'll excuse us, please?

987
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,929
I'll have another drink, if you will.

988
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:17,974
- Another?
- No.

989
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:23,229
If you'll excuse me, I'll go up
and throw a few things together...

990
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,982
...like for the next 10 years.

991
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,034
Mr. Drayton...

992
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:41,664
...I don't know you,
and wouldn't wanna offend you...

993
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:47,086
...but are you nuts? Are you telling
me that you approve of this?

994
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:49,839
I wasn't going to tell you that.

995
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:54,052
Because you may be
a big newspaper publisher...

996
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:58,723
...and I'm a pensioned-off mailman,
but you are out of your mind!

997
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:11,903
I have a good idea of what
my father is saying to him.

998
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:13,529
I wish I knew.

999
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,700
You were talking with him upstairs.

1000
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:21,954
Have you any idea what Mr. Drayton
is saying to my father?

1001
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,248
I can tell you one thing.

1002
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:28,252
I was sorry to hear that you
intend to withdraw...

1003
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:32,090
...if you encounter any opposition.

1004
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,190
She's up there packing.

1005
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:54,195
John, your mother
would like to speak to you.

1006
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:03,079
- This is a mess. Where's Joey?
- Upstairs.

1007
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:05,289
I'm going up.

1008
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:10,128
- Everything is ready when you are.
- We're not ready, Tillie.

1009
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:16,843
Well, what you're saying is you feel
practically the same as I do.

1010
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:22,473
That's right. But even so, this is a hell
of an unhappy situation...

1011
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:26,269
...for both your son and my daughter.

1012
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:30,481
I think it'd be best if you
talked to John yourself.

1013
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:45,496
I said that if they didn't approve,
there'd be no marriage.

1014
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:52,003
- I set the terms, Mama.
- They don't disapprove.

1015
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:57,049
- Only Mr. Drayton.
- Are you sure?

1016
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:01,429
She said she'd even
drive you to the airport.

1017
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:09,145
John, I've lived with your father
for almost 40 years.

1018
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,773
God willing, there'd be more.

1019
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:19,447
And even though I've only known
about this situation for one hour...

1020
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:23,618
...I feel the same way
Mrs. Drayton does.

1021
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,705
She says Joanna
will never give you up.

1022
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:34,045
I guess it depends upon
how much you want her.

1023
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,589
Want her?

1024
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,385
I want her, Mama.

1025
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:47,016
You know what it's been like for me
these past eight years?

1026
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:49,894
I felt like I never
wanted anybody again.

1027
01:25:50,521 --> 01:25:53,940
But, Mama...

1028
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:57,068
...these last few days with her...

1029
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:01,614
...it's like I'm alive again.
It's love.

1030
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:04,617
Excuse me, doctor.

1031
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:11,499
- Your father wants to talk to you.
- Does he?

1032
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,501
He's in my study.

1033
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:38,067
I've been talking to your husband.
He seems upset by all this.

1034
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:42,655
I know. Your wife says
you are too, Mr. Drayton.

1035
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:46,534
Not upset, exactly.
It's a very difficult problem.

1036
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:52,164
For whom? For you and my husband?

1037
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:55,501
I think you'll solve your problem.

1038
01:26:56,128 --> 01:27:00,047
All you have to do is tell them
you're against them. That's all.

1039
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:03,217
And you'll have no problem.

1040
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:07,972
You're not telling me
you're happy about this?

1041
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:12,768
This is not a night for talking
about happiness.

1042
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:15,021
This is an unhappy night.

1043
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:20,026
You talked to Christina.
I know how she feels.

1044
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:24,572
Can you imagine for one minute
that I want to see them hurt?

1045
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:29,660
No. No more than my husband does.

1046
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:34,165
But hurt they're going to be...

1047
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:38,586
...worse than my husband knows.

1048
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:41,839
I think worse than you know too.

1049
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:48,012
He's as much against this
as I am, maybe more.

1050
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:53,100
Son, you've got to listen. I'm not
telling you how to live your life...

1051
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,270
...but you never made
a mistake like this.

1052
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,524
You've been a source
of pride for me and your mother.

1053
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,818
But you don't know what you're doing!

1054
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:07,156
This affair happened too fast,
you said so yourself.

1055
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:12,453
You've got to stop and think!
Have you thought what people will say?

1056
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:16,332
In 16 or 17 states
you'd be breaking the law.

1057
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:21,379
And say they changed the law,
that don't change how people feel.

1058
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:25,967
You never put a wrong foot anywhere.
But you're out of line!

1059
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:28,344
That's for me to decide, man.

1060
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:31,722
- Shut up and let me...
- Don't say that to me!

1061
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:36,644
You have no right
after what I've been through.

1062
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:41,357
You know that and I know that.
I know what you made of yourself...

1063
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:45,152
...but I worked my ass off
to buy the chances you had!

1064
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:49,490
You know how far I carried that bag
in 30 years?

1065
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:53,661
Seventy-five thousand miles.
And mowing lawns in the dark...

1066
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:58,290
...so you wouldn't be stoking furnaces
and could bear down on the books.

1067
01:28:59,001 --> 01:29:02,962
There were things your mother should
have had that she insisted you have.

1068
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:08,050
And I don't mean fancy things.
I mean a decent coat. A lousy coat!

1069
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:13,097
You'll say that means nothing?
You'll break your mother's heart?

1070
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:19,812
What happens to men
when they grow old?

1071
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,774
Why do they forget everything?

1072
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:29,989
I believe those two young people
need each other...

1073
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:33,534
...like they need the air
to breathe in.

1074
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:38,122
Anybody can see that
by just looking at them.

1075
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,791
But you and my husband...

1076
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:44,170
...you might as well be blind men.

1077
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:48,966
You can only see
that they have a problem.

1078
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:52,595
But do you really know
what's happened to them...

1079
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,514
...how they feel about each other?

1080
01:29:57,059 --> 01:30:00,519
I believe that men grow old...

1081
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:06,275
...and when sexual things
no longer matter to them...

1082
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:11,864
...they forget it all,
forget what true passion is.

1083
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:18,245
If you ever felt what my son...

1084
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:25,169
...feels for your daughter, you and my
husband forgot everything about it.

1085
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:29,423
You knew once, but that
was a long time ago.

1086
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:32,009
Now the two of you don't know.

1087
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:37,598
And the strange thing
for your wife and me...

1088
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:43,229
...is that you don't even remember.

1089
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:48,609
If you did, how could you do
what you are doing?

1090
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:59,245
I don't care what your mother says.
This is between you and me.

1091
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:03,541
That's the first thing you've said
that makes any sense.

1092
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,795
- And what I mean to say...
- You've said what you had to say.

1093
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:10,756
You listen to me.

1094
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,720
You don't want to tell me
how to live my life?

1095
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:19,223
So, what have you been doing?

1096
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:24,061
You tell me what rights I've got
and what I owe you.

1097
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:30,234
Let me tell you something.
I owe you nothing.

1098
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:35,656
If you carried that bag a million
miles, you did what you had to do.

1099
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:38,284
You brought me into the world.

1100
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:42,329
From that day, you owed me
everything you could...

1101
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:47,001
...like I will owe my son.
But you don't own me!

1102
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:51,172
You can't tell me when or
where I'm out of line...

1103
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:54,091
...or make me live by your rules.

1104
01:31:54,926 --> 01:32:00,347
You don't know what or who I am, Dad.
How I feel, what I think!

1105
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:04,935
And if I tried to explain,
you will never understand.

1106
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:08,939
You are 30 years older than I am.

1107
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:14,320
Your generation thinks the way it was
is the way it's got to be!

1108
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:17,072
Not until your generation dies...

1109
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:20,576
...will your dead weight
be off our backs!

1110
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:24,622
You understand?
You've got to get off my back!

1111
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:49,188
Dad.

1112
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:53,692
You're my father.

1113
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:57,112
I'm your son. I love you.

1114
01:32:57,322 --> 01:33:02,284
I always have and I always will.

1115
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:06,038
But you think of yourself
as a colored man.

1116
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,834
I think of myself as a man.

1117
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:21,011
Now, I've got a decision to make.

1118
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:26,016
And I've got to make it alone,
and I've got to make it in a hurry.

1119
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:28,435
So...

1120
01:33:29,688 --> 01:33:33,899
...would you go out there
and see after my mother?

1121
01:34:21,948 --> 01:34:23,532
Mom!

1122
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:27,036
Oh, darling!

1123
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:31,665
Talk John's parents
into flying over with you.

1124
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:36,378
It would mean so much to John,
and I know they can afford it.

1125
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:39,673
John's father will make
it rough for him.

1126
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:44,053
Did you see his expression
when he went to talk with Dad?

1127
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:49,516
- But don't you like her already?
- Yes, darling, I do. She's a good one.

1128
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:54,188
When John's father saw that I was
white, I thought he'd faint.

1129
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:59,693
- What about your own father?
- Yes. That was funny, wasn't it?

1130
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:03,030
Mom, isn't this thrilling?
Aren't you just...?

1131
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:06,533
Yes, darling, I am just...

1132
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:58,377
I should be able to say something
to you, Mrs. Prentice.

1133
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:03,090
In my trade there are a hundred
clichéd phrases of comfort...

1134
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:05,843
...for every human condition.

1135
01:36:06,052 --> 01:36:09,471
But in the midst
of this heartbreaking distress...

1136
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:13,559
...I must admit
I'm completely stumped.

1137
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:18,147
There's simply nothing I could say.

1138
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:24,486
- Mary, you've got to understand...
- Please, John.

1139
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:28,574
The monsignor is right.
Please, say no more.

1140
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:53,390
I'll be a son of a bitch.

1141
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:14,369
Close the door, Mr. Drayton.

1142
01:37:25,298 --> 01:37:28,425
You didn't have the guts
to tell me face to face?

1143
01:37:28,635 --> 01:37:31,428
Before you start telling me
about my guts...

1144
01:37:31,638 --> 01:37:34,890
...I told you I'd have
something to say.

1145
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:37,684
Now I'm ready to say it.

1146
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:41,813
Are you going to stay in here?

1147
01:37:50,907 --> 01:37:52,950
Joey.

1148
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:00,165
You know that I'm completely
sympathetic, don't you?

1149
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:03,877
You know that I have
no reservations about anything.

1150
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:07,130
And whatever makes you happy,
I'm happy too.

1151
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:10,342
Of course I know that.

1152
01:38:10,552 --> 01:38:13,637
Then listen to me, darling.

1153
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:18,517
There's something I have to tell you
about this situation...

1154
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:20,769
...which you don't really...

1155
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:26,191
Christina! What are you doing up
there? Joey! Come down, both of you!

1156
01:38:28,695 --> 01:38:32,364
Can I get you a drink,
Mr. And Mrs. Prentice?

1157
01:38:32,574 --> 01:38:37,119
- No, thank you.
- John? Mike? No, you've had enough.

1158
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:40,706
- Dad. What's going on?
- There's something I want to say.

1159
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:45,919
I'd like you to sit down
and keep quiet. Please, sit down.

1160
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:48,922
Sit down, Chris, please.

1161
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:54,886
I have a few things to say, and you
might just think they're important.

1162
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:59,349
It's been a strange day.
That's not putting it too strongly.

1163
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:03,186
I might even say it's been
an extraordinary day.

1164
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:07,941
I've been thinking about the day
and the way it has gone...

1165
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:11,028
...and it seems to me that now...

1166
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:14,906
...I need to make a few personal
statements...

1167
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:17,492
...for a variety of reasons.

1168
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:27,794
The day began for me when I came in
and Tillie said to me...

1169
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:30,547
Excuse me. Tillie!

1170
01:39:30,757 --> 01:39:32,549
This'll only take a second.

1171
01:39:32,759 --> 01:39:37,054
- Everything's been ready...
- All right, Tillie. Sit down.

1172
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:40,098
This is Miss Matilda Binks...

1173
01:39:40,308 --> 01:39:43,727
...who's been a member of this family
for 22 years.

1174
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:48,023
And who today has made a great
deal of trouble. Sit down.

1175
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:55,822
Now, the minute I walked into
this house this afternoon...

1176
01:39:56,032 --> 01:40:01,078
...Miss Binks said to me,
"All hell done broke loose now. "

1177
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:03,955
I asked to what she referred...

1178
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:07,918
...and she said, "You'll see. "
And I did.

1179
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:13,548
After some preliminary guessing games,
at which I was never very good...

1180
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:19,221
...it was explained by my daughter
that she intended to get married...

1181
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:23,975
...and that her intended was a young
man whom I'd never met...

1182
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:26,895
...who happened to be a Negro.

1183
01:40:27,105 --> 01:40:31,566
I think it's fair to say
that I responded to this news...

1184
01:40:31,776 --> 01:40:34,778
...the same way that
any good father would...

1185
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:39,074
...unless his daughter
happened to be a Negro too.

1186
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:41,410
In a word, I was flabbergasted.

1187
01:40:41,619 --> 01:40:44,788
And while I was
still being flabbergasted...

1188
01:40:44,997 --> 01:40:49,501
...I was informed by my daughter,
a very determined young woman...

1189
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:55,090
...much like her mother,
that the marriage was on...

1190
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:58,885
...no matter what her mother
and I might feel about it.

1191
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:05,183
Then the next rather startling
development occurred, when you said...

1192
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:09,020
...that unless we approved
of the marriage...

1193
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:11,273
...there would be no marriage.

1194
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:15,026
- You didn't. What a funny thing to do.
- Joey.

1195
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:21,992
This may be the last chance I'll
ever have to tell you to do anything.

1196
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:24,578
So I'm telling you, shut up.

1197
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:33,253
Now, it became clear
that we had one single day...

1198
01:41:33,463 --> 01:41:37,966
...in which to make up our minds
about this situation.

1199
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:41,678
So, what happened?
My wife, typically enough...

1200
01:41:41,888 --> 01:41:46,558
...decided to ignore every
practical aspect of the situation...

1201
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:51,104
...and went off in a romantic haze,
which made her...

1202
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:55,859
...totally inaccessible
to anything in the way of reason.

1203
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:02,908
I have not as yet referred
to His Reverence...

1204
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:06,578
...who forced his way
into the situation...

1205
01:42:06,788 --> 01:42:11,917
...insulted my intelligence
by mouthing 300 platitudes...

1206
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:15,504
...and ended it by coming
to my room...

1207
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:19,132
...and challenging me
to a wrestling match.

1208
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:22,803
- What time is your plane?
- Ten forty-five.

1209
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:25,305
Right.

1210
01:42:25,515 --> 01:42:30,060
Now, Mr. Prentice,
clearly a most reasonable man...

1211
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:35,273
...says he has no wish to offend me
but wants to know if I'm a nut.

1212
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:39,444
Mrs. Prentice says that,
like her husband...

1213
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:44,658
...I'm a burned-out shell of a man
who cannot remember what it's like...

1214
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:50,288
...to love a woman
the way her son loves my daughter.

1215
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:58,880
And strange as it seems...

1216
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:02,217
...that's the first statement
made to me all day...

1217
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:05,595
...with which I'm prepared
to take issue.

1218
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:13,019
Because I think you're wrong.
You're as wrong as you could be.

1219
01:43:14,063 --> 01:43:18,024
I admit that I hadn't considered it...

1220
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:21,778
...but I know exactly
how he feels about her.

1221
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:27,784
And there is absolutely nothing
that your son feels for my daughter...

1222
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:32,372
...that I didn't feel for Christina.

1223
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,126
Old, yes.

1224
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:39,170
Burned-out, certainly.

1225
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:43,842
But I can tell you,
the memories are still there.

1226
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:48,680
Clear, intact, indestructible.

1227
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:53,643
They'll be there if I live to be 110.
Where John made his mistake...

1228
01:43:53,853 --> 01:43:58,398
...was attaching so much importance
to what we thought.

1229
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:03,528
Because in the final analysis it
doesn't matter a damn what we think.

1230
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:06,948
The only thing that matters
is what they feel...

1231
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:12,162
...and how much they feel
for each other.

1232
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:19,836
And if it's half of what we felt...

1233
01:44:23,382 --> 01:44:25,383
...that's everything.

1234
01:44:39,482 --> 01:44:45,528
As for the problems you'll have,
they seem almost unimaginable.

1235
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:47,822
But you'll have no problem with me.

1236
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:53,620
And I think that when
Christina and I and your mother...

1237
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:59,250
...have time to work on him, you'll
have no problem with your father.

1238
01:45:02,004 --> 01:45:07,425
But you do know, I'm sure you know,
what you're up against.

1239
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:11,262
There'll be 100 million people
in this country...

1240
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:16,893
...who'll be shocked and offended
and appalled at the two of you.

1241
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:21,564
And you'll have to ride that out...

1242
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:25,276
...maybe every day
for the rest of your lives.

1243
01:45:26,445 --> 01:45:29,614
You can try to ignore those people...

1244
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:33,868
...or even feel sorry for them
and for their bigotry...

1245
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:38,081
...and their blind hatreds
and stupid fears...

1246
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:43,712
...but where necessary, you'll just
have to cling tight to each other...

1247
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:47,007
...and say, "Screw all those people. "

1248
01:45:47,967 --> 01:45:52,637
Anybody could make a case
against your getting married.

1249
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:56,766
The arguments are so obvious,
nobody has to make them.

1250
01:45:58,227 --> 01:46:01,271
But you're two wonderful people...

1251
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:04,107
...who fell in love...

1252
01:46:05,443 --> 01:46:08,737
...and happened to have
a pigmentation problem.

1253
01:46:09,655 --> 01:46:14,576
I think that no matter what kind
of a case some bastard could make...

1254
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:19,706
...against your getting married,
there'd be only one thing worse.

1255
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:24,627
And that would be if,
knowing what you two are...

1256
01:46:24,837 --> 01:46:27,005
...knowing what you two have...

1257
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:30,216
...and knowing what you two feel...

1258
01:46:30,426 --> 01:46:32,552
...you didn't get married.

1259
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:58,078
Well, Tillie. When the hell
we gonna get some dinner?
