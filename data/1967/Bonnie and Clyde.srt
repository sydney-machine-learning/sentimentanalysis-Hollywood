1
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:21,098
Hey, boy!

2
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:24,178
<i>What are you doing with my mama's car?</i>

3
00:03:31,143 --> 00:03:32,258
Wait there!

4
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:50,656
<i>Ain't you ashamed?</i>

5
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:53,454
<i>Trying to steal an old lady's automobile?</i>

6
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:54,942
What are you talking about?

7
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:56,536
I've been thinking about buying me one.

8
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:57,578
Bull!

9
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:01,100
<i>You ain't got money for dinner,
let alone buying a car.</i>

10
00:04:01,903 --> 00:04:04,133
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you something.

11
00:04:06,023 --> 00:04:08,173
I've got enough money for a Coca-Cola...

12
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:10,936
<i>...and since it don't look like
you're going to invite me inside...</i>

13
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:13,662
<i>You'd steal the dining room table if I did.</i>

14
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:17,575
You want to go into town with me?
How would that be?

15
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:20,421
<i>I'm going to work, anyway.</i>

16
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:24,455
You're going to work, huh?
What kind of work do you do?

17
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:26,301
None of your business.

18
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:28,540
I'll bet you're a movie star.

19
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:30,815
Huh? A lady mechanic?

20
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:32,898
A maid?

21
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:34,815
What do you think I am?

22
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:36,258
A waitress.

23
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:46,898
What line of work are you in...
when you're not stealing cars?

24
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:51,253
<i>Well, I'm looking for suitable
employment right at the moment.</i>

25
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:53,174
Oh, yeah, but what did you do before?

26
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:56,061
I was in State Prison.

27
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:57,817
State Prison?

28
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:04,900
<i>Well, I guess some little old lady
wasn't so nice.</i>

29
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,741
It was armed robbery.

30
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:18,215
The things that turn up
in the street these days.

31
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:29,296
Hey, what do you all do for a good time
around here? Listen to the grass grow?

32
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:32,136
I guess you had a lot more fun
up at State Prison.

33
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,977
- I'll tell you. See my right foot?
- Yeah?

34
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:40,101
I chopped two toes off that foot
with an axe.

35
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,538
What! Why?

36
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:44,616
- To get off of work detail. Want to see it?
- No!

37
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:51,612
<i>I surely don't intend to stand
here in the middle of Main Street...</i>

38
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:54,013
...and look at your dirty feet!

39
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:04,334
Boy, did you really do that?

40
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:20,616
<i>What's it like?</i>

41
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,495
What do you mean, prison?

42
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:28,576
Armed robbery.

43
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:37,621
<i>It ain't like anything.</i>

44
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:42,212
Shoot. I knew you never robbed any place,
you faker.

45
00:07:07,663 --> 00:07:10,223
<i>Bet you wouldn't have
the gumption to use it.</i>

46
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:21,461
You just wait right here and
you keep your eyes open.

47
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:55,101
<i>Hey, what's your name?</i>

48
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:56,977
Clyde Barrow.

49
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,222
<i>Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.
Uh, pleased to meet you.</i>

50
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:29,257
Hey, hey, hey, slow down,
slow down, slow down.

51
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,532
Take it easy, you've got my hand trapped.

52
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:34,261
Cut it out! Cut it out!

53
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:45,622
All right, now.

54
00:08:45,703 --> 00:08:49,173
<i>I might as well tell you right off.
I ain't much of a lover boy.</i>

55
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,371
<i>That don't mean nothing
personal about you.</i>

56
00:08:52,903 --> 00:08:54,894
I never saw no percentage in it.

57
00:08:55,183 --> 00:08:57,822
<i>Ain't nothing wrong with me.
I don't like boys.</i>

58
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:03,663
Boy! Boy! Boy!

59
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:07,052
"Boy," what?

60
00:09:07,303 --> 00:09:09,419
Your advertising is just dandy.

61
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,620
<i>Folks would never guess
you don't have a thing to sell.</i>

62
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:16,974
<i>You'd better take me home now.</i>

63
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:19,703
<i>- Now, wait a minute.
- Now don't you touch me.</i>

64
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:23,261
All right, all right...

65
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:25,739
...if all you want is a stud service,
you get on back to West Dallas,

66
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:28,417
...and you stay there, the rest of your life.

67
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,092
You're worth a lot more...

68
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:34,619
<i>...and you know it, and that's why
you're comin' along with me.</i>

69
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,852
You could find a lover boy on
every damn corner in town.

70
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,740
<i>Don't matter to them
if you're waiting tables or picking cotton...</i>

71
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:41,893
...but it does make a damn to me!

72
00:09:44,303 --> 00:09:45,258
Why?

73
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,575
<i>"Why?" What do you mean, "why?"
Because you're different, that's why.</i>

74
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:50,301
You know, you're like me.
You want different things.

75
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:53,181
You've got something
better than being a waitress.

76
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:56,742
You and me traveling together, we could
cut a path clean across this state...

77
00:09:56,823 --> 00:10:01,101
...and Kansas and Missouri and Oklahoma,
and everybody would know about it.

78
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,937
You listen to me, Miss Bonnie Parker.
You listen to me.

79
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:05,661
<i>How'd you like to go
walking into the dining room...</i>

80
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:07,461
...of the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas...

81
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:10,535
...wearing a nice silk dress and
have everybody waiting on you?

82
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:12,898
Would you like that?
That seem like a lot to ask?

83
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:15,975
<i>That ain't enough for you.
You've got a right to that.</i>

84
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:22,814
When did you figure all that up?

85
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:25,056
The minute I saw you.

86
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:27,693
Why?

87
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:31,102
Because you may be the
best damn girl in Texas.

88
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,336
You were born somewhere
around east Texas, right?

89
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,695
Come from a big old family.

90
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:52,451
<i>You went to school,
but you didn't take to it much...</i>

91
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,659
...because you were a lot
smarter than everybody else...

92
00:10:54,743 --> 00:10:56,859
...so you just up and quit one day.

93
00:10:56,983 --> 00:11:00,658
<i>Now, when you were 16... 17,
there was a guy who worked in a...</i>

94
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:02,657
Cement plant.

95
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:03,653
Right. And you liked him...

96
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:06,655
...because he thought you were
just as nice as you could be.

97
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:09,701
<i>You almost married that guy, but then you
thought no, you didn't think you would.</i>

98
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,580
So then you got your job in a cafe.

99
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:14,461
And now you wake up every morning
and you hate it.

100
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:19,261
<i>You just hate it. You get on down there
and you put on your white uniform...</i>

101
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:21,252
<i>It's pink.</i>

102
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:24,057
Those truck drivers come there
to eat your greasy burgers and...

103
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:27,772
...they kid you and you kid them back
but they're stupid and dumb boys...

104
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:30,172
<i>...with their big old tattoos,
and you don't like it.</i>

105
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:32,731
<i>They ask you for dates and sometimes
you go, but you mostly don't because...</i>

106
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:36,099
...all they're trying to do is get in your
pants, whether you want them to or not.

107
00:11:36,183 --> 00:11:38,174
So you go on home and you
sit in your room and...

108
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:40,652
...you think: " Now when, and how...

109
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:43,977
"... am I ever going to get away from this?"

110
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:48,096
And now you know.

111
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:01,294
<i>Change that. I don't like it.</i>

112
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:26,896
You're a knock-out!

113
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:38,413
<i>- Hey, that ain't ours.
- Sure it is.</i>

114
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:40,416
No, but we came in this one.

115
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:42,937
<i>That don't mean we have to go home in it.</i>

116
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:21,855
Where have you been keeping yourself?

117
00:13:21,943 --> 00:13:23,581
I slept out by the car.

118
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:27,452
<i>These accommodations ain't
particularly deluxe.</i>

119
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:29,420
If they're after us, I want the first shot.

120
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:32,301
Now, you come on out here.
We got some work to do.

121
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,416
You're good!

122
00:13:44,503 --> 00:13:46,016
<i>I ain't good. I'm the best.</i>

123
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:47,218
And modest.

124
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:49,972
Now see that?

125
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,016
Set her spinning.

126
00:13:57,623 --> 00:13:59,773
<i>It's all right, all right.
Come on, try it again.</i>

127
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:02,775
Try it again, now this time
come down slow, slow.

128
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:12,901
<i>Now, how about that?
Now, ain't you something? I tell you.</i>

129
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:15,941
<i>I'm going to get you a Smith & Wesson.
Go in your hand easier.</i>

130
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,537
- I want you to try something now.
- Hey, you!

131
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:21,895
No, sir! No, sir!

132
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:25,661
Y'all go right ahead.

133
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:40,337
<i>It used to be my place.
But it's not anymore.</i>

134
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:44,176
Bank took it.

135
00:14:49,783 --> 00:14:51,614
Yes, sir, they moved us off.

136
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:53,935
Now it belongs to them.

137
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,414
<i>Why, that's a pitiful shame.</i>

138
00:14:59,543 --> 00:15:01,215
You're damn right, ma'am.

139
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:08,498
Me and him put in the years here.

140
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:15,536
Y'all go right ahead.
We just came by for a last look.

141
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:37,817
Y'all mind?

142
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,814
Hey, Davis! Come on over here!

143
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,777
<i>That's right.</i>

144
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:00,298
Go on.

145
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:14,657
Much obliged.

146
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:18,053
My name is Otis Harris. This is Davis.
We worked this place.

147
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:20,373
<i>How're you?
This here's Miss Bonnie Parker.</i>

148
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:22,613
<i>- Glad to meet you.
- I'm Clyde Barrow.</i>

149
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:29,457
We rob banks.

150
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:42,297
<i>Look, I don't want you
to worry about nothing.</i>

151
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,733
This is going to be
the easiest thing in the world.

152
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:46,779
Your mama could take this bank.

153
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:59,134
You just be ready if I need you.

154
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:24,415
What are you waiting for?

155
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:37,538
<i>This is a stick-up! Just take it easy
and nothing's going to happen to you.</i>

156
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,022
Give me the money.

157
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:41,536
Give me the money.

158
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:44,183
<i>What money, mister?
There ain't no money here.</i>

159
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,778
<i>What are you talking about?
This here's a bank, ain't it?</i>

160
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:52,856
Well, it was a bank,
but we failed three weeks ago.

161
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:02,253
All right, now, you get on out here.

162
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,658
You get on out there and tell my girl.

163
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,582
Come on, come on,
you tell her what you told me.

164
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,293
We've got $1.98, and you're laughing!

165
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:06,779
<i>Let's see now.
A loaf of bread, a dozen eggs...</i>

166
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:09,981
...quart of milk, four fried pies.

167
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:19,501
<i>Come on now, you sure
you ain't got no peach pies?</i>

168
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,255
Get the hell out of here!

169
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:49,302
Go ahead! Go ahead!

170
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:57,016
<i>He tried to kill me. Why'd he try
to kill me. I didn't want to hurt him.</i>

171
00:19:58,383 --> 00:19:59,338
Try to get something to eat...

172
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:02,859
...and some son of a bitch
comes up on you with a meat-cleaver.

173
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:05,542
<i>I ain't against him.</i>

174
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:13,702
<i>I ain't against him.</i>

175
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,097
Now, you just tell me
what was wrong with that, boy.

176
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,059
Dirt.

177
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,652
Dirt?

178
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
Dirt in the fuel line. Just blowed it away.

179
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:55,693
Excuse me, ma'am,
is there anything else I could do for you?

180
00:20:57,183 --> 00:20:59,014
Well, you're a smart feller.

181
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:02,140
<i>You sure do know a lot about automobiles,
don't you?</i>

182
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,815
Yes. I guess I do.

183
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:12,212
Would you know what kind of car this is?

184
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:15,733
This is a four cylinder Ford Coupe.

185
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:20,695
Huh? Sure, sure is.

186
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:25,657
This is a stolen, four cylinder Ford Coupe.

187
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,893
<i>Hey, you ain't scared, are you? Huh?</i>

188
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:39,577
I believe he is.

189
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:43,092
<i>That's a pity. We sure could've
used a smart boy like that...</i>

190
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:45,936
...who knows such a great
deal about automobiles.

191
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:50,854
Are you a good driver, boy?

192
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,176
Yeah, reckon I am.

193
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:57,174
<i>No, he's better off here.</i>

194
00:21:58,303 --> 00:21:59,861
<i>What's your name, boy?</i>

195
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:01,338
C.W. Moss.

196
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:05,177
<i>Well, I'm Miss Bonnie Parker
and this here is Mr. Clyde Barrow.</i>

197
00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:07,575
We rob banks.

198
00:22:19,823 --> 00:22:22,417
<i>There ain't nothing wrong with that,
is there?</i>

199
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:28,291
<i>Clyde, he ain't the one. Let's go.</i>

200
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,014
You think you got the guts
for our line of work?

201
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:34,937
What are you talking about?
I spent a year, a year in reformatory.

202
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:36,936
A man with a record!

203
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,821
I know you got the nerve to short change
old ladies coming in for gas.

204
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:44,135
<i>What I'm asking you is have you got
what it takes to pull bank jobs with us?</i>

205
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:49,500
<i>Sure, I do. I ain't afraid,
if that's what you think.</i>

206
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:51,097
Prove it.

207
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:21,221
You're gonna be all right.

208
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:31,333
<i>I'm afraid we're overdrawn again.</i>

209
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:34,136
This is a stick-up!

210
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,221
<i>This here's a stick-up!</i>

211
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:40,854
Leave it there. Leave it there.

212
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,983
Come on, come on, everything.
Get it up here.

213
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:14,421
<i>Clyde, where's the car?</i>

214
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:27,777
What the hell you doing, parking the car?

215
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:39,097
Stop that car!

216
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:43,095
Up ahead, cut left! Left!

217
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:59,420
<i>" We're in the money, the sky is sunny</i>

218
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:02,940
<i>" Old man depression, you are through,
you done us wrong</i>

219
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:06,940
<i>" We never see a headline,
about a bread line, today</i>

220
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:11,177
<i>"And when we see the landlord,
we can look that guy right in the eye</i>

221
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:14,257
<i>" Oh, we're in the money,
come on, my honey"</i>

222
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:16,613
<i>You ain't got a brain in your skull.</i>

223
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:27,452
On account of you, I killed a man.

224
00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:31,456
<i>And now we're all going to be wanted
for murder, and that's you too, boy.</i>

225
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:43,415
Dumb head! Stupid!

226
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:46,580
What were you thinking about?

227
00:27:48,703 --> 00:27:52,173
<i>Do a dumb-ass thing like that again,
boy, I'm going to kill you.</i>

228
00:27:52,543 --> 00:27:55,580
<i>If you boys want to talk,
why don't y'all go outside?</i>

229
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:37,577
Honey, come on, I want to talk to you
for just a minute. Sit down.

230
00:28:42,703 --> 00:28:45,422
This afternoon we killed
a man and we were seen.

231
00:28:45,903 --> 00:28:47,734
Now, so far, nobody knows who you are...

232
00:28:47,823 --> 00:28:50,940
<i>...but they know who I am and they'll be
after me and anybody who's with me.</i>

233
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:53,662
<i>And that's murder.
Now it's going to get rough.</i>

234
00:28:53,903 --> 00:28:55,575
<i>I can't get out, but right now you still can.</i>

235
00:28:55,663 --> 00:28:57,016
I want you to say the word to me...

236
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,571
...and I'll put you on that bus
back to your mama...

237
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:03,702
<i>...because you mean a lot to me,
and I ain't going to make you run with me.</i>

238
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:11,732
No!

239
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:14,621
<i>I ain't a rich man.
You could get a rich man if you tried.</i>

240
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:16,614
<i>I don't want no rich man!</i>

241
00:29:23,663 --> 00:29:25,972
<i>You ain't going to have a minute's peace.</i>

242
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:27,212
You promise?

243
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:04,100
<i>Huh, at least I'm not a liar.</i>

244
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:18,053
<i>I told you I wasn't no lover boy.</i>

245
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:48,454
Now, let me look at you boy.

246
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,173
Oh boy, you can do better than that.

247
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:02,821
<i>Hey, hey, hey, how's Mama?</i>

248
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:05,822
Oh, fine, fine.
Sister, Sister sent her best to you.

249
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:07,734
Filling out. Must be that prison food.

250
00:33:07,823 --> 00:33:10,053
<i>No, no, no, it's married life...</i>

251
00:33:10,383 --> 00:33:12,692
...and, you know what they say, it's...

252
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,251
<i>...it's the face powder
that gives a man interest, but...</i>

253
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:18,141
<i>...but it's the baking powder
that keeps him home.</i>

254
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:22,453
I want you to meet my wife, Blanche.

255
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:23,896
This is my baby brother.

256
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:25,735
<i>How're you doing?
It's really nice to know you.</i>

257
00:33:25,823 --> 00:33:27,017
How do you do?

258
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:41,502
<i>I hear you're taking real good care
of the baby of the family...</i>

259
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:43,539
<i>I'm just so glad to meet you.
Come on over here.</i>

260
00:33:43,623 --> 00:33:45,773
I want you to meet my wife, Blanche.

261
00:33:49,423 --> 00:33:51,653
Hey, everybody, this is C.W. Moss.

262
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:54,134
My brother, Buck, and his wife, Blanche.

263
00:33:54,223 --> 00:33:57,101
Howdy, everybody. Howdy, you all.

264
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:01,418
Howdy, Mrs. Barrow,
or may I call you Blanche?

265
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:03,736
I sure am pleased to meet you.

266
00:34:03,823 --> 00:34:05,973
How did you find us here
in this neck of the woods?

267
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:08,372
Boy, you sure picked a good day for it.

268
00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:11,218
Oh, is that a new Screenland Magazine?

269
00:34:11,823 --> 00:34:13,734
Any new pictures of Myrna Loy in there?

270
00:34:13,823 --> 00:34:16,132
<i>She's my favorite picture star. May I?</i>

271
00:34:17,103 --> 00:34:19,742
Hey, let me get the Kodak here.
We'll take some pictures.

272
00:34:19,823 --> 00:34:21,176
Put your pants on.
We're going to take some pictures.

273
00:34:21,263 --> 00:34:23,333
Come on Blanche, get out of there!

274
00:34:23,503 --> 00:34:26,540
<i>I'm a mess. Been driving all day, honey.</i>

275
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:36,295
Did you take my picture, Buck? I declare
I asked you not to take my picture.

276
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:38,695
Hey, Buck, get one of this.

277
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:42,737
Hey, Brother, I want to talk to you later on.

278
00:34:48,623 --> 00:34:49,817
You got that?

279
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:54,097
You take one of me and my missus,
here, Clyde.

280
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:59,018
<i>Honestly, I don't want a picture taken.</i>

281
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:04,021
Be serious. Be serious.

282
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:10,301
Hey, let me take one of Bonnie alone.
Come on, honey.

283
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:22,695
Hey, honey, a little smile.

284
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:24,661
<i>Don't want to smile, eh?</i>

285
00:35:26,183 --> 00:35:28,856
<i>I want to have a chat with you.
C.W., take the girls' pictures.</i>

286
00:35:29,183 --> 00:35:31,572
<i>Why don't you step in there with Bonnie?</i>

287
00:35:31,823 --> 00:35:33,541
What did you think of her?

288
00:35:35,983 --> 00:35:37,257
<i>She's a peach.</i>

289
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:45,861
Now, now tell me true.

290
00:35:47,823 --> 00:35:49,654
Is she as good as she looks?

291
00:35:52,463 --> 00:35:53,657
<i>She's better.</i>

292
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:03,774
<i>Hey, listen, it was,
it was either you or him, wasn't it?</i>

293
00:36:03,983 --> 00:36:06,622
The guy that you killed, you had to do it.
Was either you or him.

294
00:36:06,703 --> 00:36:08,216
He put me on the spot. I had to.

295
00:36:08,303 --> 00:36:09,941
You had to do it, right?

296
00:36:11,823 --> 00:36:15,259
<i>I know you did.
Don't say anything to Blanche about that.</i>

297
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:21,019
That time you broke out of jail,
is it true she talked you into going back?

298
00:36:21,103 --> 00:36:23,173
Yeah. You hear about that? Huh.

299
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,143
<i>Well, I won't say nothing
to Bonnie about it.</i>

300
00:36:28,463 --> 00:36:29,862
I appreciate that.

301
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:42,373
We're going to have ourselves a time, boy!

302
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:43,657
We surely are.

303
00:36:50,063 --> 00:36:51,701
What are we going to do?

304
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:58,699
I figured we all drive up to Missouri.

305
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:00,058
<i>They ain't looking for me up there.</i>

306
00:37:00,143 --> 00:37:04,056
We find a nice little place to hole up in.
We have us a regular vacation.

307
00:37:08,303 --> 00:37:09,531
No trouble now.

308
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:11,736
<i>I ain't looking to go back to no prison.</i>

309
00:37:11,823 --> 00:37:13,620
I heard in prison that you had
a little trouble there.

310
00:37:13,703 --> 00:37:15,614
You were cutting on your toes.

311
00:37:16,463 --> 00:37:18,215
You heard about that, eh?

312
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:21,022
<i>I did a little toe cutting.
That ain't but half of it.</i>

313
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:22,058
<i>I did it so I'd get off of work detail.</i>

314
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:24,862
You know, breaking those damn rocks
with a sledge hammer night and day.

315
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:27,855
And you know what?
The very next week I got paroled.

316
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:31,501
I walked out of that
God-forsaken jail on crutches.

317
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:33,816
<i>Ain't life grand?</i>

318
00:37:43,183 --> 00:37:47,062
<i>Hey, you want to hear a story,
about this boy, he owned a dairy farm...</i>

319
00:37:47,343 --> 00:37:49,493
And his old ma, she was kind of sick,
you know.

320
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:52,461
And the doctor,
he called him over and said...

321
00:37:52,783 --> 00:37:56,935
<i>"... Listen, your ma, just lying there,
she's just so sick and she's weakly...</i>

322
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:01,019
"... I want you to try to persuade her
to take a little brandy, see.

323
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:03,094
"Just to pick her spirits up, you know. "

324
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:07,495
<i>"Ma's a teetotaler," he says,
"she wouldn't touch a drop. "</i>

325
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:10,611
<i>"Well, I'll tell you what you do. "
That's the doc.</i>

326
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:12,375
"Now, I tell you what you do...

327
00:38:12,463 --> 00:38:15,660
"... you bring in a fresh quart
of milk every day...

328
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:18,941
"... and you put some brandy in it, see.
And you try that. "

329
00:38:19,023 --> 00:38:23,096
So he did, and he doctored it all up
with the brandy, fresh milk...

330
00:38:23,183 --> 00:38:26,937
...and gave it to his mama,
and she drank a little bit of it.

331
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:31,335
So next day he brought it in again,
and she drank a little more, you know.

332
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:35,252
And so then, it went on that way,
the third day just a little more...

333
00:38:35,343 --> 00:38:38,301
...and the fourth day she took
a little bit more.

334
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:41,739
And then finally, a week later,
he gave her the milk...

335
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:45,339
...and she just drank it down,
she swallowed the whole thing.

336
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,936
And she called him over and said...

337
00:38:47,023 --> 00:38:50,379
<i>"... Son, whatever you do,
don't sell that cow. "</i>

338
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:06,223
<i>All right, you got the keys now,
haven't you?</i>

339
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:26,537
<i>I gave him a month's rent in advance.
We're all set. Let's get inside.</i>

340
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:32,851
<i>Honey, lamb, I'm taking you
to our first home.</i>

341
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:34,535
"Here comes the bride"

342
00:39:34,863 --> 00:39:36,819
What do you think, honey? Huh?

343
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:39,176
Just perfect.

344
00:39:40,303 --> 00:39:41,941
This is your first home.

345
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:45,534
He gave me the grocery number.

346
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:53,736
4-3-3-7, please.

347
00:39:55,023 --> 00:39:58,618
<i>Hi there, Speedie's Groceries?
I want to order up a mess of groceries.</i>

348
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:01,092
And a Frigidaire, not an ice-box.

349
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:09,661
Eight pounds of pork chops,
four pounds of red beans.

350
00:40:12,463 --> 00:40:14,852
About eight bottles of Dr. Pepper.

351
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:28,454
You sure can play checkers.

352
00:40:37,423 --> 00:40:40,540
You need a haircut.
You're looking just like a hillbilly boy.

353
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:42,853
You are just like an old man.

354
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:46,141
<i>Playing checkers all the time,
don't pay any attention to your wife.</i>

355
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:49,977
<i>Boy, you ain't going to ever beat me,
but you just keep trying, you hear?</i>

356
00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:53,658
Oh, Daddy, you sure do need a haircut.

357
00:40:54,383 --> 00:40:57,455
Why, you look like a little old hillbilly,
I do declare.

358
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,302
Oh, mercy me, don't.

359
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:03,581
<i>Don't talk that way when she's
right there in the next room.</i>

360
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:05,654
<i>There's always somebody in
the next room, in this room...</i>

361
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:07,813
...or in every other kind of room.

362
00:41:10,543 --> 00:41:12,852
<i>Don't you ever just want
to be alone with me?</i>

363
00:41:12,943 --> 00:41:15,173
Well, I always feel like we're alone.

364
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:17,737
Do you, baby?

365
00:41:18,063 --> 00:41:19,178
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

366
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:33,016
Groceries, ma'am.

367
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:37,493
- How much?
- Six dollars and 43 cents.

368
00:41:54,863 --> 00:41:56,535
Let me help you, those bags are heavy.

369
00:41:56,623 --> 00:41:58,341
No thanks, I'll get them.

370
00:41:58,703 --> 00:42:00,261
Uh, just get the door.

371
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:19,012
"But few of them really are justified...

372
00:42:19,343 --> 00:42:21,652
"... if you get right down to the point.

373
00:42:22,383 --> 00:42:26,217
<i>"You've heard of a woman's glory
being spent on a downright cur. "</i>

374
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:28,375
Did you write all that yourself?

375
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,693
Do you want to hear this or not?

376
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:36,298
<i>"Still you can't always
judge the story as true...</i>

377
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:38,375
"... being told by her.

00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:43,663

"... though her features
were coarse and tough... "

380
00:42:46,543 --> 00:42:47,737
I knew that old gal.

381
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:50,815
She was cock-eyed
and she had a hare lip and no teeth.

382
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:56,213
"Now Sal was a gal of rare beauty...

383
00:42:56,303 --> 00:42:59,022

were coarse and tough.

384
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:03,495

"And I'll do my best to relate it,

388
00:43:14,703 --> 00:43:18,537
Hey, hey! The laws are outside!
They're blocking the driveway.

389
00:43:33,103 --> 00:43:35,333
- Please get us out of here.
- Shut up!

390
00:43:37,423 --> 00:43:40,221
They got us blocked.
We've got to get the car out.

391
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:20,933
<i>Where's Blanche? Where's Blanche?</i>

392
00:44:39,183 --> 00:44:41,253
Damn it, you almost got us killed!

393
00:44:42,063 --> 00:44:45,578
<i>What did I do wrong?
I thought you'd be happy if I got shot!</i>

394
00:44:45,903 --> 00:44:49,100
Yeah! Yeah, it would have saved us all
a lot of trouble!

395
00:44:49,743 --> 00:44:51,415
<i>Buck, don't let that woman
talk to me like that!</i>

396
00:44:51,503 --> 00:44:55,018
<i>You shouldn't have done that, Blanche.
It was a dumb thing to do.</i>

397
00:44:55,623 --> 00:44:59,502
<i>Oh Buck, please, I didn't marry you
to see you get shot, honey.</i>

398
00:45:00,303 --> 00:45:02,214
<i>Let's leave. Let's get out of here and leave.</i>

399
00:45:02,303 --> 00:45:04,942
Tell him to please stop the car
and let us out.

400
00:45:06,223 --> 00:45:08,339
I killed a guy. Now we're in this.

401
00:45:10,063 --> 00:45:11,098
Will you shut up!

402
00:45:11,183 --> 00:45:12,855
Just shut up your big mouth!

403
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,296
At least do that, just shut up!

404
00:45:14,383 --> 00:45:15,816
Cut it out, Bonnie!

405
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:20,133
Stop the car. I want to talk to you.

406
00:45:36,303 --> 00:45:37,656
Get, get rid of her.

407
00:45:37,743 --> 00:45:39,256
<i>I can't get, she's Buck's wife.</i>

408
00:45:39,343 --> 00:45:40,537
Then, get rid of them both.

409
00:45:40,623 --> 00:45:41,976
<i>Why? What's the matter with you?</i>

410
00:45:42,063 --> 00:45:43,576
<i>She is what's the matter with me.</i>

411
00:45:43,663 --> 00:45:47,019
<i>She, she's nothing but a dumb,
stupid, back-country hick.</i>

412
00:45:48,143 --> 00:45:49,815
<i>She ain't got a brain in her head.</i>

413
00:45:49,903 --> 00:45:52,212
What makes you any better?
What makes you so damn special?

414
00:45:52,303 --> 00:45:56,535
You were just a West Dallas waitress.
Spent your time picking up truck drivers.

415
00:45:57,103 --> 00:46:00,459
Oh, big Clyde Barrow!
You're just like your brother!

416
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:03,013
Ignorant, uneducated, hillbilly!

417
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,779
The only special thing about you
is your peculiar ideas about love-making...

418
00:46:06,863 --> 00:46:08,933
...which is no love-making at all.

419
00:46:21,103 --> 00:46:23,981
<i>Oh, Clyde, please, I didn't mean that.</i>

420
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:27,818
Listen, it, it was just all, all that shooting...

421
00:46:28,143 --> 00:46:32,056
<i>...and all those guns. I got so scared.
Please, honey, I didn't mean it.</i>

just figured on some easy pickings.

<i>You know, Texas Ranger,
you ain't hardly doing your job.</i>

467

You ought to be home

...not out chasing after us.

469
00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:22,934
Why do you want to take it
so personal for?

470
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:27,335
Well, all right, we've got to discourage
this bounty hunting for the Barrow Gang.

471
00:50:29,903 --> 00:50:31,894
What do you want
to do with him then, huh?

472
00:50:31,983 --> 00:50:33,052
Shoot him?

473
00:50:37,903 --> 00:50:39,018
Hang him.

00:50:39,343 --> 00:50:41,413
Uh-uh. Take his picture.

475
00:50:44,623 --> 00:50:46,454
Listen, we take his picture...

476

Hey, Buck, get the Kodak.

484
00:51:18,663 --> 00:51:21,655
Now see what came of your mischief,
not doing your job?

485
00:51:21,903 --> 00:51:24,371
You know, down in Duncanville last year...

486
00:51:24,463 --> 00:51:27,614
...poor farmers kept you laws
away from us with shotguns.

487
00:51:27,983 --> 00:51:29,052
You're supposed to be
protecting them from us...

488
00:51:29,143 --> 00:51:31,099
...and they're protecting us from you.

489
00:51:31,183 --> 00:51:33,060
<i>That don't make sense, do it?</i>

490
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:39,220
Get right in there!

a Texas Ranger in the family.</i>

493
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:50,857
<i>How's this?</i>

494
00:52:24,303 --> 00:52:27,693
We're going to put that picture
in every paper in the country!

495
00:52:36,943 --> 00:52:40,140
We got you!
You just stay there for a while.

496
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:46,378
We got you!

497
00:53:03,983 --> 00:53:06,372
Good afternoon. This is the Barrow Gang.

498
00:53:07,503 --> 00:53:10,893
Now if everybody will just take it easy,
nobody will get hurt.

499
00:53:22,863 --> 00:53:24,376
Is that your money or the bank's?

500
00:53:24,463 --> 00:53:25,339
Mine.

501
00:53:25,743 --> 00:53:27,574
All right, you keep it then.

502
00:53:31,823 --> 00:53:34,462
Next time I'll aim a little lower.

503
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,412
<i>Take a good look, Pop. I'm Buck Barrow.</i>

504
00:54:00,463 --> 00:54:02,021
We're the Barrow boys.

505
00:54:08,303 --> 00:54:09,736
Happy birthday, hon.

506
00:54:22,863 --> 00:54:26,697
It was the Barrow Gang, Charlie.
I think they're headed for Oklahoma.

507
00:54:47,983 --> 00:54:49,052
Load this!

508
00:55:07,983 --> 00:55:11,180
There I was, staring square into
the face of death.

509
00:55:35,823 --> 00:55:39,179
And all I can say is they did right by me.

510
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:43,020
<i>And I'm bringing me a mess
of flowers to their funeral.</i>

511
00:56:10,543 --> 00:56:12,613
Slow down, we're in Oklahoma now!

512
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:17,733
<i>Come on, let's catch them, anyway.</i>

513
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:21,811
<i>I'm not going to risk my life in Oklahoma.</i>

514
00:56:43,663 --> 00:56:45,016
<i>Ain't much, is it?</i>

515
00:56:45,103 --> 00:56:46,616
Well, times are hard.

516
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:50,173
<i>Well, let's get down to it.</i>

517
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,221
I want my share.

518
00:57:08,423 --> 00:57:10,937
If Bonnie gets a share, I want a share, too.

519
00:57:11,023 --> 00:57:12,502
What are you talking about?

520
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:14,335
Tell Clyde I want my share.

521
00:57:20,143 --> 00:57:21,781
What about Blanche here?

522
00:57:23,303 --> 00:57:24,497
Well, why not?

523
00:57:27,823 --> 00:57:30,701
Well, why not!
I earn my share same as everybody.

524
00:57:30,983 --> 00:57:32,814
I could've got killed same as everybody.

525
00:57:32,903 --> 00:57:35,053
<i>And I'm wanted by the law
same as everybody.</i>

526
00:57:35,143 --> 00:57:38,419
Besides, I could have got snake-bit
sleeping in those woods every night.

527
00:57:38,503 --> 00:57:41,017
<i>I'm a nervous wreck and that's the truth...</i>

528
00:57:41,863 --> 00:57:45,299
...and I have to take sass
from Miss Bonnie Parker all the time.

529
00:57:45,383 --> 00:57:46,452
I deserve mine!

530
00:57:46,543 --> 00:57:50,616
Hold on, Blanche, hold your horses,
Blanche, you're going to get your share.

531
00:57:57,103 --> 00:58:01,699
<i>I married the preacher's daughter and she
thinks she's still taking up the collection.</i>

532
00:58:06,223 --> 00:58:08,737
<i>Now, honey, don't spend it all in one place!</i>

533
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:18,135
<i>Listen now. I guess I'm going
to have to keep saying this...</i>

534
00:58:18,223 --> 00:58:20,657
...Blanche is married to Buck,
and Buck is family.

535
00:58:20,743 --> 00:58:23,303
My family could use some of that money.

536
00:58:23,623 --> 00:58:24,738
You know how those laws...

537
00:58:24,823 --> 00:58:26,051
<i>...have been hanging around
your mama's house.</i>

538
00:58:26,143 --> 00:58:27,542
<i>It's too risky to go there now.</i>

539
00:58:27,623 --> 00:58:30,854
But where can we go now? We rob
the damn banks. What else do we do?

540
00:58:30,943 --> 00:58:32,376
Well, what do you want to do?

541
00:58:32,463 --> 00:58:33,976
<i>Clyde, there's a hole in the pan.</i>

542
00:58:34,063 --> 00:58:36,452
We're losing oil. We've got to swipe
another car if we want to get anywhere.

543
00:58:36,543 --> 00:58:37,896
Come on and look.

544
00:59:03,343 --> 00:59:05,379
<i>Say, isn't that your car, Eugene?</i>

545
00:59:06,223 --> 00:59:07,451
<i>That's my car!</i>

546
00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:14,496
<i>That's my car! Hey!</i>

547
00:59:17,743 --> 00:59:18,937
<i>That's my car!</i>

548
00:59:35,023 --> 00:59:37,821
- They're coming after us!
- Come on, kick it in the pants.

549
00:59:37,903 --> 00:59:41,373
<i>I'm going to tear them apart!
Those punks!</i>

550
00:59:42,343 --> 00:59:43,856
<i>Stealing a man's car.</i>

551
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:47,817
Wait till I get my hands
on those kids, Velma.

552
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:49,894
<i>I'm going to tear them apart!</i>

553
00:59:51,623 --> 00:59:53,534
What if they have guns, Eugene?

554
00:59:55,943 --> 00:59:59,140
Listen, we better get the police
and let them handle this.

555
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,777
<i>All right, now, turn around.
Turn around and let's go back to town.</i>

556
01:00:02,863 --> 01:00:04,774
Then we'll go get the sheriff.

557
01:00:09,383 --> 01:00:12,898
They stopped chasing us.
Hey, they're turning around there.

558
01:00:14,503 --> 01:00:15,822
<i>Let's take them.</i>

559
01:00:22,343 --> 01:00:24,573
Oh, my Lord, they're coming after us.

560
01:00:25,703 --> 01:00:27,136
Step on it, Velma.

561
01:00:32,903 --> 01:00:34,939
What do you want to do that for, Clyde?

562
01:00:35,023 --> 01:00:38,015
Step on it, Velma. Step on it, Velma!

563
01:00:59,503 --> 01:01:01,778
Hey, hey, what are you doing in there?

564
01:01:15,823 --> 01:01:18,576
All right, get on out of there.
Come on, come on.

565
01:01:19,783 --> 01:01:22,741
You, you want to go
for a little ride in our new car?

566
01:01:23,143 --> 01:01:25,134
Oh, my, can we all fit in there?

567
01:01:31,823 --> 01:01:33,893
<i>There's not room for me in there.</i>

568
01:01:46,383 --> 01:01:47,782
<i>What's your names?</i>

569
01:01:49,703 --> 01:01:53,059
<i>- I'm Eugene Griz... I'm Eugene Grizzard.
- I'm Velma Davis.</i>

570
01:01:55,783 --> 01:01:57,614
Well, we're the Barrow Gang.

571
01:02:02,183 --> 01:02:06,415
<i>Oh, now listen, now don't be scared.
It ain't like you was the law or anything.</i>

572
01:02:06,703 --> 01:02:09,012
I mean, you're just folks, just like us.

573
01:02:09,103 --> 01:02:11,298
<i>Yeah. Yeah, that's the truth.</i>

574
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:16,057
I, uh, expect you've been reading about us.

575
01:02:20,743 --> 01:02:21,937
We have, too.

576
01:02:23,143 --> 01:02:27,136
Well, now, you two must be in love,
I bet, huh?

577
01:02:31,943 --> 01:02:34,582
Now, boy, when are you going
to marry the girl?

578
01:02:42,983 --> 01:02:45,497
He gave her the milk,
and she drank a little bit of it.

579
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:49,895
The next day, he gave her some more and
she drank some more till a week goes by.

580
01:02:50,023 --> 01:02:53,299
And he brings her the milk
and she drinks down every drop of it.

581
01:02:53,383 --> 01:02:55,692
And she looks at her son,
calls him over and says...

582
01:02:55,783 --> 01:02:59,617
<i>"... Son, whatever you do,
don't sell that cow. "</i>

583
01:03:14,863 --> 01:03:18,378
<i>I'm from Wisconsin originally.
Where the cheese comes from.</i>

584
01:03:19,823 --> 01:03:23,020
<i>Oh, oh, but he just loves Texas now.
Don't you, Eugene?</i>

585
01:03:23,343 --> 01:03:24,901
<i>"Don't sell that cow. "</i>

586
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:28,536
How old are you, honey?

587
01:03:28,623 --> 01:03:29,976
<i>I'm thirty-three.</i>

588
01:03:47,343 --> 01:03:50,062
<i>Now, didn't I order some French fries?</i>

589
01:03:50,383 --> 01:03:52,453
Uh, yeah, you did. Here you are.

590
01:03:56,143 --> 01:03:59,419
<i>Now take it easy on those French fries,
Velma. Ain't that right, Eugene?</i>

591
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,095
<i>Uh, this isn't mine.</i>

592
01:04:01,743 --> 01:04:04,815
<i>I ordered mine well done.
Who's got the other hamburger?</i>

593
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,413
Oh, is this supposed to be yours?

594
01:04:12,943 --> 01:04:14,501
<i>It's okay. Forget it.</i>

595
01:04:15,823 --> 01:04:17,893
<i>Hey, I'm sure having a good time.</i>

596
01:04:19,183 --> 01:04:20,536
<i>Aren't you glad we picked you up?</i>

597
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:22,341
You're a grand host, Buck.

598
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:25,172
Maybe y'all ought to join up with us.

599
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:31,660
Boy, they sure would be surprised
to hear that back home.

600
01:04:32,303 --> 01:04:35,101
What would Bill and Martha say
if they heard that?

601
01:04:35,183 --> 01:04:37,572
Lordy, they would have a fit!

602
01:04:38,863 --> 01:04:40,694
Hey, what do you do, anyhow?

603
01:04:42,063 --> 01:04:43,462
<i>I'm an undertaker.</i>

604
01:04:48,303 --> 01:04:49,816
Get them out of here.

605
01:05:18,543 --> 01:05:20,181
<i>I don't see her, Clyde.</i>

606
01:05:21,103 --> 01:05:22,661
Bonnie, where are you?

607
01:05:34,543 --> 01:05:35,942
Where do you think she could've went?

608
01:05:36,023 --> 01:05:38,901
<i>I don't know. I just don't know.</i>

609
01:05:45,103 --> 01:05:46,058
There!

610
01:06:01,103 --> 01:06:02,536
Leave me alone!

611
01:06:02,863 --> 01:06:04,342
Where are you going?

612
01:06:04,463 --> 01:06:05,578
Get away!

613
01:06:11,503 --> 01:06:13,221
Oh, I want to see my mama.

614
01:06:14,223 --> 01:06:15,781
I want to see my mama.

615
01:06:15,983 --> 01:06:19,339
<i>Please, honey, don't ever leave me
without saying nothing.</i>

616
01:06:28,143 --> 01:06:31,021
Clyde, listen, to me. Clyde, please.

617
01:06:31,663 --> 01:06:33,415
Now, listen. I mean it.

618
01:06:33,743 --> 01:06:35,973
I've been thinking about my mama...

619
01:06:36,943 --> 01:06:39,821
<i>...and she's getting so old,
and I want to see her.</i>

620
01:06:41,743 --> 01:06:42,971
You'll see her.

621
01:07:15,343 --> 01:07:16,935
Would you look at him?

622
01:07:19,183 --> 01:07:20,901
<i>He just don't remember me.</i>

623
01:07:22,863 --> 01:07:24,819
<i>He'll get used to me, won't he?</i>

624
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,541
We've been cutting and pasting
everything we could find about you.

625
01:07:28,623 --> 01:07:31,091
<i>Hey, Clyde, there's the shot I took of you.</i>

626
01:07:31,183 --> 01:07:33,094
<i>Came out real fine, didn't it?</i>

627
01:08:06,703 --> 01:08:09,740
<i>"Horsey, get your tail up
Why don't you make it rise"</i>

628
01:08:11,343 --> 01:08:14,415
Oh, Lord, we thank you for
the safety of our loved ones.

629
01:08:15,023 --> 01:08:17,491
And the food we are about to receive.
Amen.

630
01:08:31,503 --> 01:08:34,495
- Bye-bye. Y'all be careful.
- We're going to miss you.

631
01:08:37,903 --> 01:08:40,212
Where you all headed to from here, Clyde?

632
01:08:40,303 --> 01:08:43,932
<i>At this point we ain't heading to nowhere.
We're just running from.</i>

633
01:08:56,303 --> 01:08:59,659
<i>Mama, why don't you stay a little longer.</i>

634
01:09:01,423 --> 01:09:03,414
Listen, I want you to have this.

635
01:09:12,783 --> 01:09:14,933
Listen, make mama stay a while yet, huh?

636
01:09:15,023 --> 01:09:18,857
You know, Clyde, I read about you all
in the papers...

637
01:09:19,183 --> 01:09:22,141
...and I just get scared.

638
01:09:22,863 --> 01:09:26,458
<i>Now, Mrs. Parker, don't you believe
what you read in all those newspapers.</i>

639
01:09:26,543 --> 01:09:28,056
<i>That's the laws talking there.</i>

640
01:09:28,143 --> 01:09:31,101
They want us to look big so they're
going to look big when they catch us.

641
01:09:31,183 --> 01:09:32,696
<i>And they ain't going to catch us.</i>

642
01:09:32,783 --> 01:09:35,251
<i>Because I'm even better at running
than I am at robbing banks.</i>

643
01:09:35,343 --> 01:09:37,652
Shoot, if we did half that stuff
they say we did in those papers...

644
01:09:37,743 --> 01:09:40,257
<i>...we'd be millionaires by now,
wouldn't we?</i>

645
01:09:41,103 --> 01:09:43,571
<i>I ain't going to risk my little girl here
just to make money...</i>

646
01:09:43,663 --> 01:09:45,381
...uncertain as times are.

647
01:09:45,903 --> 01:09:47,575
<i>Why, I knew of a job...</i>

648
01:09:48,303 --> 01:09:49,816
You remember the time.
Why, I could have...

649
01:09:49,903 --> 01:09:52,861
...we could have got two
thousand dollars just as easy as pie.

650
01:09:52,943 --> 01:09:56,299
And I, I pulled up outside there
and I saw them laws...

651
01:09:56,943 --> 01:10:00,333
...and I said to myself, I said,
"Bonnie could get hurt here. "

652
01:10:00,623 --> 01:10:03,501
So we just drove right on
and I let that money lay.

653
01:10:03,663 --> 01:10:05,494
Maybe you know the way with her, then.

654
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:08,222
<i>I'm just an old woman
and I don't know nothing.</i>

655
01:10:08,783 --> 01:10:12,219
But Mrs. Parker, this here is the way
we know best how to make money.

656
01:10:12,303 --> 01:10:14,134
We'll quit all this as soon as
hard times are over.

657
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:15,702
I can tell you that.

658
01:10:16,303 --> 01:10:18,612
Just the other night,
me and Bonnie were talking...

659
01:10:18,703 --> 01:10:23,140
...and, we were talking about the time we
were going to settle down and get a home.

660
01:10:23,663 --> 01:10:27,497
<i>She says to me, she says,
"You know, I couldn't bear...</i>

661
01:10:28,143 --> 01:10:31,374
"... to live more than three miles
from my precious mother. "

662
01:10:31,823 --> 01:10:33,973
Now, how do you like that, Mother Parker?

663
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,974
<i>I don't believe I would.</i>

664
01:10:39,503 --> 01:10:43,132
<i>You try to live three miles from me
and you won't live long, honey.</i>

665
01:10:44,623 --> 01:10:47,183
You best keep running, Clyde Barrow.

666
01:10:47,663 --> 01:10:48,982
And you know it.

667
01:10:53,423 --> 01:10:54,697
Bye, baby.

668
01:11:19,423 --> 01:11:22,142
Look, who is this here?
Is this your girlfriend?

669
01:11:23,503 --> 01:11:24,936
"L-o-v-e. "

670
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:27,733
Well, whose idea was it to get bluebirds?

671
01:11:27,823 --> 01:11:30,212
Bonnie's. Bonnie picked it out.

672
01:11:31,503 --> 01:11:33,459
Day after we robbed the armory.

673
01:11:35,663 --> 01:11:38,131
<i>I want you to touch something here. Ah...</i>

674
01:11:38,223 --> 01:11:40,783
Now, I want you just
to touch it right there.

675
01:11:47,343 --> 01:11:50,062
<i>Why don't you all go into your own cabin...</i>

676
01:11:50,383 --> 01:11:52,658
...if you want to play with C.W.? Huh?

677
01:11:52,783 --> 01:11:56,219
<i>What's the matter with you now,
besides your nasty disposition?</i>

678
01:11:58,223 --> 01:11:59,656
Wait now. Hold on!

679
01:12:02,063 --> 01:12:05,612
I saw a chicken place a few miles back.
Who all wants to get some food?

680
01:12:05,703 --> 01:12:08,058
<i>I certainly do.
I'm sick to death of sitting around here.</i>

681
01:12:08,143 --> 01:12:10,577
<i>Why, you can't even drive the car, honey.</i>

682
01:12:11,183 --> 01:12:13,413
Just get us five chicken dinners.

683
01:12:16,303 --> 01:12:20,535
Hey, get some dessert there, too. Some
peach ice cream or something, will you?

684
01:12:44,143 --> 01:12:47,613
Oh, baby, I've got the blues so bad.

685
01:12:57,903 --> 01:12:59,894
Well, is it what your mama said?

686
01:13:03,823 --> 01:13:05,415
What mama?

687
01:13:08,623 --> 01:13:10,454
<i>She's just an old woman now.</i>

688
01:13:12,463 --> 01:13:14,055
<i>I don't have no mama.</i>

689
01:13:17,423 --> 01:13:18,776
No family either.

690
01:13:22,383 --> 01:13:23,657
<i>I'm your family.</i>

691
01:13:39,183 --> 01:13:41,413
You know, when we started out...

692
01:13:41,743 --> 01:13:44,462
...I thought we were
really going somewhere.

693
01:13:47,183 --> 01:13:48,457
But this is it.

694
01:13:51,503 --> 01:13:53,095
We're just going, huh?

695
01:13:56,303 --> 01:13:57,418
I love you.

696
01:14:11,343 --> 01:14:13,174
You sure are smoking a lot lately.

697
01:14:13,263 --> 01:14:14,252
So what?

698
01:14:22,383 --> 01:14:24,817
<i>Why don't you go back to your pa's house?</i>

699
01:14:26,863 --> 01:14:28,182
If I only could.

700
01:14:29,263 --> 01:14:31,572
If I could only just do that one thing.

701
01:14:34,223 --> 01:14:36,657
<i>There's no telling how all this happened.</i>

702
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,414
<i>I was a preacher's daughter.</i>

703
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:43,733
What church was your pa affiliated with?

704
01:14:43,823 --> 01:14:44,812
Baptist.

705
01:14:52,783 --> 01:14:55,251
He thought the world of Buck,
my daddy did.

706
01:14:55,983 --> 01:14:58,451
Even though Buck was serving time in jail.

707
01:15:00,943 --> 01:15:03,980
He forgave him because he paid
his debt to society.

708
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:08,374
We were Disciples of Christ.

709
01:15:19,183 --> 01:15:21,743
Hey, I have no money.
Give me some, will you?

710
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:43,653
Get me Sheriff Smoot on the phone.

711
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,653
<i>" I love to spend</i>

712
01:15:48,943 --> 01:15:51,173
<i>" Each Sunday with you</i>

713
01:15:51,663 --> 01:15:53,255
<i>"As friend to friend</i>

714
01:15:54,703 --> 01:15:57,092
<i>"I'm sorry it's through"</i>

715
01:15:59,823 --> 01:16:01,495
<i>Mmm, that's more like it.</i>

716
01:16:01,903 --> 01:16:04,622
Look how much better it fits
since I took it up.

717
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,854
The men are on the other side.

718
01:17:27,983 --> 01:17:29,336
Hold it, hold it!

719
01:17:29,463 --> 01:17:30,418
Get out!

720
01:18:39,503 --> 01:18:43,257
<i>Give me a gun, please! Somebody,
give me a gun. I don't have a gun.</i>

721
01:18:46,863 --> 01:18:49,821
Be quiet! Please, be quiet!
We're trying to get out.

722
01:19:14,703 --> 01:19:17,695
<i>It didn't happen, Daddy,
it didn't happen. I know it.</i>

723
01:19:19,663 --> 01:19:21,096
Blanche, stop that!

724
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:42,497
<i>I'd rather go to jail than go on like this.</i>

725
01:19:44,943 --> 01:19:47,696
<i>He ain't got a chance.
Half his head's blown off.</i>

726
01:19:51,023 --> 01:19:54,379
<i>Dear Lord, it's happened. Please help us.</i>

727
01:19:55,343 --> 01:19:58,415
And Buck will never do anything
wrong again in his life.

728
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:03,655
My eyes.

729
01:20:04,943 --> 01:20:06,695
<i>I think I'm blind!</i>

730
01:20:07,183 --> 01:20:08,616
My eyes!

731
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:11,175
The light hurts so bad!

732
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:21,093
Tell Clyde to get us to a doctor.

733
01:20:21,423 --> 01:20:23,334
Bonnie! We're dying!

734
01:20:23,823 --> 01:20:26,053
<i>Buck can't be moved, now, hon.</i>

735
01:20:33,423 --> 01:20:35,493
I believe I lost my shoes, Clyde.

736
01:20:36,943 --> 01:20:38,615
I think the dog got them.

737
01:21:13,103 --> 01:21:14,172
Surrender!

738
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,216
In the car! Come on!

739
01:21:19,183 --> 01:21:20,218
Keep low!

740
01:21:45,263 --> 01:21:48,300
Cross-fire! Keep low! Cross-fire!

741
01:22:05,263 --> 01:22:08,221
<i>Charlie, don't shoot!
The kids are in the cross-fire!</i>

742
01:22:08,463 --> 01:22:10,772
I'll go get the car. I'll get the car.

743
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:12,822
Hey, Buck, this way.

744
01:22:15,023 --> 01:22:18,857
They're heading for the other car!
Shoot it! Knock the hell out of it!

745
01:22:40,783 --> 01:22:42,182
Hold your fire!

746
01:22:43,023 --> 01:22:44,376
<i>Daddy, don't die!</i>

747
01:22:47,983 --> 01:22:51,737
<i>Get away. Get away and leave him alone.
He's dying. Can't you see he's dying?</i>

748
01:22:51,823 --> 01:22:53,256
Let me go! Daddy!

749
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:57,576
<i>You've killed him! He's dying!
God, can't you see he's dying?</i>

750
01:23:52,783 --> 01:23:53,818
<i>Maybe...</i>

751
01:25:35,023 --> 01:25:38,220
Can you all spare us some drinking water?

752
01:25:38,703 --> 01:25:40,056
Who are you, boy?

753
01:25:40,143 --> 01:25:41,417
My name is Moss.

754
01:26:18,383 --> 01:26:20,374
<i>That's Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker.</i>

755
01:26:20,463 --> 01:26:22,021
What happened to them?

756
01:26:25,743 --> 01:26:27,142
Are they fainting?

757
01:26:46,543 --> 01:26:48,420
Is that really Bonnie Parker?

758
01:27:19,343 --> 01:27:20,537
Daddy, Daddy!

759
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,296
<i>- Who's there?
- C.W.</i>

760
01:27:27,023 --> 01:27:29,981
<i>Oh, it's good to see you, boy.
Oh, boy, it's good to see you.</i>

761
01:27:30,063 --> 01:27:31,576
<i>What's that on your chest, there?</i>

762
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,301
Tattoo, Daddy. Come on.

763
01:27:35,023 --> 01:27:36,661
You've got to help them.

764
01:27:38,543 --> 01:27:40,022
Help me get them in.

765
01:27:41,263 --> 01:27:43,902
What happened to them?
Are you in trouble, son?

766
01:27:48,223 --> 01:27:49,656
Help me get 'em in.

767
01:27:59,343 --> 01:28:02,301
How come you marked yourself
all up with that tattoo?

768
01:28:02,863 --> 01:28:05,855
What the hell made you do
a damn fool thing like that?

769
01:28:08,943 --> 01:28:11,616
Just open the door.

770
01:28:20,303 --> 01:28:22,612
I came here to question Blanche Barrow.

771
01:28:22,863 --> 01:28:24,581
<i>So you're the Frank Hamer?</i>

772
01:28:27,663 --> 01:28:30,461
I figure to have my picture
taken with those two...

773
01:28:30,543 --> 01:28:32,295
...just one more time.

774
01:28:32,943 --> 01:28:35,741
It says here: "Clyde fled his dying brother. "

775
01:28:35,823 --> 01:28:37,495
Where? What do they mean fled?

776
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:41,781
How could I leave my brother to die,
when he was already dead when I left him?

777
01:28:41,903 --> 01:28:43,018
Fled!

778
01:28:44,463 --> 01:28:45,578
Newspapers!

779
01:28:46,543 --> 01:28:48,420
While we're all lying around here
near dead...

780
01:28:48,503 --> 01:28:51,097
...they had us holding up
the Grand Prairie National Bank.

781
01:28:51,183 --> 01:28:53,743
Guess they hung that one on us
just for luck.

782
01:28:54,383 --> 01:28:58,740
As soon as we get well, we're going to
hold up that bank. We're going to take it!

783
01:29:10,703 --> 01:29:13,092
<i>They don't know nothing, do they, honey?</i>

784
01:29:14,063 --> 01:29:16,213
How come they always referring to me,
the newspapers as...

785
01:29:16,303 --> 01:29:19,215
..."unidentified suspect"?

786
01:29:19,983 --> 01:29:21,655
<i>You just be glad that's all you are.</i>

787
01:29:21,743 --> 01:29:23,415
<i>Long as they don't know your last name.</i>

788
01:29:23,503 --> 01:29:26,973
<i>That's right, boy. Mr. Barrow's looking out
for your interests.</i>

789
01:29:30,063 --> 01:29:31,018
Hey, Pa.

790
01:29:31,823 --> 01:29:35,099
<i>How's it feel to have a couple of big deals
stay in your house?</i>

791
01:29:35,183 --> 01:29:37,014
<i>Ain't that something for me?
That's something for me, ain't it?</i>

792
01:29:37,103 --> 01:29:39,014
You've been mighty nice to us.

793
01:29:39,503 --> 01:29:43,974
I want you to let us pay you, say,
forty dollars for your hospitality.

794
01:29:47,183 --> 01:29:49,651
<i>I'm just happy to have
you folks here as company.</i>

795
01:29:49,743 --> 01:29:51,734
<i>Anybody's a friend of my boy,
you know I...</i>

796
01:29:51,823 --> 01:29:55,054
<i>Come on, let's go have some supper.
I'm starving. Come on.</i>

797
01:29:55,983 --> 01:29:58,372
You're all welcome here. You know that.

798
01:29:59,663 --> 01:30:03,576
And you just make yourself right at home
and stay as long as you want to.

799
01:30:11,983 --> 01:30:14,577
You look like trash, all marked up like that.

800
01:30:15,983 --> 01:30:17,132
Cheap trash!

801
01:30:19,503 --> 01:30:21,221
Bonnie says it looks good.

802
01:30:22,543 --> 01:30:25,501
<i>What does Bonnie know?
She ain't nothing but cheap trash herself.</i>

803
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:28,541
<i>Look what they do to you.
You don't ever get your name in the paper.</i>

804
01:30:28,623 --> 01:30:31,421
You just get them pictures printed
on your skin by Bonnie and Clyde.

805
01:30:31,503 --> 01:30:34,142
<i>Shoot, they ain't nothing
but a couple of kids.</i>

806
01:30:36,143 --> 01:30:39,294
<i>I'm so glad your ma ain't alive
to see this here thing...</i>

807
01:30:41,743 --> 01:30:43,574
...all jellied up like that!

808
01:30:45,263 --> 01:30:48,300
<i>I don't see what's so bad about it.</i>

809
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:51,097
You wouldn't!

810
01:30:56,143 --> 01:30:59,818
The word is out that Bonnie and Clyde
are holed up just out of town.

811
01:30:59,983 --> 01:31:03,055
And they're fixing to bust in here
and take Blanche out.

812
01:31:04,263 --> 01:31:05,742
All two of them?

813
01:31:28,943 --> 01:31:30,012
Who is it?

814
01:31:39,983 --> 01:31:43,658
<i>I guess it's been kind of rough on you,
hasn't it?</i>

815
01:31:46,863 --> 01:31:49,502
Being the daughter of a preacher,
like you are.

816
01:32:00,943 --> 01:32:04,458
<i>I imagine old Buck wasn't a bad sort,
was he?</i>

817
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:06,297
No, he wasn't.

818
01:32:07,983 --> 01:32:09,098
I reckon...

819
01:32:10,543 --> 01:32:12,181
...Clyde just sort of...

820
01:32:13,423 --> 01:32:15,300
<i>...led him astray, didn't he?</i>

821
01:32:24,943 --> 01:32:26,854
<i>That's a shame, Blanche.</i>

822
01:32:31,343 --> 01:32:33,095
Yes, ma'am.

823
01:32:34,783 --> 01:32:35,977
<i>That's a shame.</i>

824
01:32:36,303 --> 01:32:38,533
That he led your Buck astray.

825
01:32:39,503 --> 01:32:41,573
Clyde, his own brother... Bonnie...

826
01:32:44,943 --> 01:32:46,661
...and that little feller.

827
01:32:47,983 --> 01:32:51,771
The one that was with you when
you took that Texas Ranger in Missouri.

828
01:32:54,863 --> 01:32:57,093
<i>He was with you all along, wasn't he?</i>

829
01:33:02,503 --> 01:33:03,492
C.W.

830
01:33:04,463 --> 01:33:05,657
<i>That's right.</i>

831
01:33:12,463 --> 01:33:14,454
<i>I don't recollect his last name.</i>

832
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,374
Moss. C.W. Moss.

833
01:33:21,103 --> 01:33:22,934
He was there that day we met them.

834
01:33:23,023 --> 01:33:25,901
<i>I didn't want to go. I didn't want to.</i>

835
01:33:27,023 --> 01:33:30,379
And Buck said we were
just going on a visit...

836
01:33:30,863 --> 01:33:33,423
<i>...and we wouldn't do no
stealing or robbing.</i>

837
01:33:35,663 --> 01:33:38,382
And we went up to Joplin,
and all of a sudden...

838
01:33:39,343 --> 01:33:42,380
...all of a sudden,
they all just started shooting.

839
01:33:52,463 --> 01:33:53,942
What're you writing?

840
01:33:54,543 --> 01:33:56,773
<i>I'm writing a poem about us.</i>

841
01:33:58,223 --> 01:33:59,451
Let me hear it.

842
01:34:02,063 --> 01:34:03,940
Just let me finish this line.

843
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:10,703
<i>It's called "The Story of Bonnie and Clyde. "</i>

844
01:34:11,023 --> 01:34:14,857
"You've heard the story of Jesse James,
of how he lived and died.

845
01:34:15,503 --> 01:34:18,222
"If you're still in need
of something to read...

846
01:34:18,383 --> 01:34:20,851
<i>"... here's the story of Bonnie and Clyde. "</i>

847
01:34:21,423 --> 01:34:24,779
<i>You think if I sent that into the newspaper,
they'd print it?</i>

848
01:34:26,223 --> 01:34:27,656
<i>I'm going to do it.</i>

849
01:34:28,623 --> 01:34:31,012
"Now Bonnie and Clyde
are the Barrow Gang.

850
01:34:31,343 --> 01:34:34,540
<i>"I'm sure you all have read
how they rob and steal...</i>

851
01:34:34,863 --> 01:34:38,014
"... and those who squeal are
usually found dying or dead.

852
01:34:38,703 --> 01:34:40,933
"They call them cold-hearted killers.

853
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:44,818
"They say they are heartless and mean.

854
01:34:45,103 --> 01:34:48,778
"But I say this with pride,
that I once knew Clyde...

855
01:34:49,103 --> 01:34:51,663
"... when he was honest
and upright and clean.

856
01:34:52,143 --> 01:34:55,021
"But the laws fooled around,
kept taking him down...

857
01:34:55,343 --> 01:34:57,413
"... and locking him up in a cell.

858
01:34:57,583 --> 01:35:01,895
<i>"Till he said to me, 'I'll never be free,
so I'll meet a few of them in Hell. '</i>

859
01:35:02,543 --> 01:35:07,014
"If a policeman is killed in Dallas,
and they have no clue to guide.

860
01:35:07,503 --> 01:35:10,939
<i>"If they can't find a fiend,
they just wipe their slate clean...</i>

861
01:35:11,023 --> 01:35:13,173
"... and hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.

862
01:35:13,743 --> 01:35:15,893
"If they try to act like citizens...

863
01:35:16,303 --> 01:35:18,612
"... and rent them a nice little flat...

864
01:35:19,023 --> 01:35:22,060
"... about the third night,
they're invited to fight...

865
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,453
<i>"... by a sub-gun's rat-a-tat-tat.</i>

866
01:35:25,103 --> 01:35:27,173
"Someday they'll go down together.

867
01:35:27,343 --> 01:35:29,334
"They'll bury them side by side.

868
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:31,095
"To few it will be grief...

869
01:35:31,183 --> 01:35:32,696
"... to the law a relief...

870
01:35:32,783 --> 01:35:35,217
<i>"... but it's death for Bonnie and Clyde. "</i>

871
01:35:40,303 --> 01:35:43,181
You know what you've done there?
You told my story.

872
01:35:44,463 --> 01:35:46,613
You told my whole story right there.

873
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:51,173
One time I told you I was gonna
make you somebody.

874
01:35:51,263 --> 01:35:53,174
<i>That's what you've done for me.</i>

875
01:35:53,263 --> 01:35:55,902
You made me somebody
they're going to remember.

876
01:37:29,103 --> 01:37:30,775
Hey, eh, how do you feel?

877
01:37:31,343 --> 01:37:33,095
I mean, do you feel the way
you're supposed to feel...

878
01:37:33,183 --> 01:37:34,457
<i>...when you're, when you're, after you're...</i>

879
01:37:34,543 --> 01:37:35,737
<i>Yeah, just...</i>

880
01:37:36,943 --> 01:37:39,503
<i>Well, that's, that's good, isn't it?</i>

881
01:37:41,103 --> 01:37:44,140
<i>Look, I, I figure that it's
a good idea to ask...</i>

882
01:37:44,623 --> 01:37:47,501
<i>...because how else are
you going to know if it...</i>

883
01:37:48,463 --> 01:37:50,055
You did just perfect.

884
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:55,017
<i>I did, didn't I?</i>

885
01:37:57,903 --> 01:37:59,382
I mean I really did.

886
01:38:00,943 --> 01:38:03,013
I never figured on that.

887
01:38:05,903 --> 01:38:08,622
Clyde, why do you want to marry me?

888
01:38:11,983 --> 01:38:14,099
To make an honest woman out of you.

889
01:38:18,703 --> 01:38:20,182
What would you do...

890
01:38:20,943 --> 01:38:24,936
...what would you do
if some miracle happened...

891
01:38:26,703 --> 01:38:30,059
...and we could walk out of here
tomorrow morning...

892
01:38:30,383 --> 01:38:33,261
...and start all over again. Clean.

893
01:38:34,063 --> 01:38:37,260
With no record and nobody after us?

894
01:38:49,743 --> 01:38:51,734
<i>I guess I'd do it all different.</i>

895
01:38:55,183 --> 01:38:56,332
First off...

896
01:38:57,743 --> 01:39:00,541
<i>...I wouldn't live in the same state
where we pull our jobs.</i>

897
01:39:00,623 --> 01:39:03,660
<i>We'd live in a, in another state
and stay clean there.</i>

898
01:39:03,983 --> 01:39:07,737
<i>And then when we wanted to take a bank,
we'd go into the other state.</i>

899
01:39:30,703 --> 01:39:33,263
Boy, did they expect you to go
downtown with them tomorrow?

900
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:34,298
Who?

901
01:39:34,863 --> 01:39:36,535
<i>Bonnie and Clyde, that's who.
Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

902
01:39:36,623 --> 01:39:38,500
Sure. I always go with them.

903
01:39:43,823 --> 01:39:46,212
Yeah, you better. You better go.

904
01:39:48,463 --> 01:39:51,261
But when they go to get in their
car to come on home...

905
01:39:51,343 --> 01:39:52,696
<i>...don't you get back in there with them.</i>

906
01:39:52,783 --> 01:39:53,818
Why, Daddy?

907
01:39:53,903 --> 01:39:56,053
<i>You listen to your pa for once,
can't you do that?</i>

908
01:39:56,143 --> 01:39:59,215
<i>I'm your pa. I'm your kin.
Not that there Clyde Barrow.</i>

909
01:40:00,303 --> 01:40:03,101
<i>What do you want me to tell them,
"I can't get back in the car with you"?</i>

910
01:40:03,183 --> 01:40:05,174
You tell them nothing, you hear?

911
01:40:08,303 --> 01:40:11,261
I made a deal and got you off
with a couple of years.

912
01:40:12,143 --> 01:40:15,101
You just be sure that you're
off the streets in that town...

913
01:40:15,183 --> 01:40:17,333
...when they go to get in their car.

914
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:20,222
You think laws is going to catch
Bonnie and Clyde in town?

915
01:40:20,303 --> 01:40:21,782
<i>Clyde's got a sense.</i>

916
01:40:21,903 --> 01:40:23,655
<i>Don't you know that, Daddy?</i>

917
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:27,340
Nobody catches Clyde. Never.

918
01:40:30,383 --> 01:40:31,338
Never!

919
01:41:01,263 --> 01:41:02,776
What happened to C.W.?

920
01:41:02,863 --> 01:41:07,061
<i>He's over there in the hardware store,
getting some light bulbs for his daddy.</i>

921
01:41:14,383 --> 01:41:16,055
You going to wear them like that?

922
01:41:16,143 --> 01:41:17,861
Drive with one eye closed.

923
01:41:19,503 --> 01:41:20,982
Want some ice cream?

924
01:41:21,423 --> 01:41:24,381
<i>Look here. Isn't that just
the prettiest thing you ever saw?</i>

925
01:41:24,463 --> 01:41:27,500
Look, you can see every fingernail
of her hand. Look.

926
01:41:27,823 --> 01:41:30,701
<i>That's the prettiest thing.
Hey, where is that boy?</i>

927
01:41:30,863 --> 01:41:32,774
Listen, I'll go get him, okay?

928
01:42:04,143 --> 01:42:05,292
Gladys Jean!

929
01:42:05,903 --> 01:42:07,382
Time to go home now.

930
01:42:42,383 --> 01:42:45,739
Get back there in about twenty minutes
and we'll pick him up.

931
01:42:47,503 --> 01:42:51,542
<i>I tell you, if that boy didn't have
his head strapped on him, he'd lose it.</i>

932
01:43:16,623 --> 01:43:18,534
<i>Hey, isn't that Malcolm there?</i>

933
01:43:38,863 --> 01:43:41,093
<i>Got a flat tire. Ain't got no spare.</i>
