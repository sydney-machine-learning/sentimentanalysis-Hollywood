00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,300
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?

181
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,200
Would you like
to sit down?

182
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,100
Right here.

183
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,400
O.K. We'll both stand up.

184
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,300
Oh, I see.

185
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,300
Very good.
You got me there.

186
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,700
Could you
look at me, please?

187
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,600
If you don't
look at me, I can't...

188
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,700
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me

189
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,600
that you've been here
since you were 5.

190
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,700
Mm-hmm.

191
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,400
Um...

192
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,700
when did you graduate?

193
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,200
And, uh, now... now...
now you work here?

194
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Are you reading
my lips?

195
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,500
I don't think that
you are reading my lips.

196
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Ohhh...

197
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Gee, that was quick of me,
wasn't it?

198
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,600
You could've told me.

199
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,200
Why? I don't know.

200
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,400
How about common courtesy?

201
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,100
How about me
getting out of here

202
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,400
so you can
mop the floor?

203
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,600
Man...

204
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,500
you know,
if you let me,

205
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,000
I bet I could teach you
how to speak.

206
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,500
And you could teach me...

207
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,400
but I don't want
to mop the floor.

208
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,200
Gee, that was quick.

209
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,900
And you don't
want to speak.

210
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,600
Brilliant.

211
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,900
Schmuck.

212
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,600
It's a damn shame.

213
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,300
Costly, too.

214
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,400
Resodding
is damn costly.

215
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,800
No. I'm talking
about Sarah Norman.

216
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,700
Right. Sarah.
Look at this, will you?

217
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,100
What a mess.

218
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,000
Has she ever
tried speaking?

219
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Sarah's not
hard of hearing.

220
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.

221
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,800
That makes it tough.

222
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,700
The rain's
lousing up the fields.

223
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,100
It's a shame
that a bright woman

224
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,600
is stuck here
cleaning toilets.

225
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,000
Doesn't bother her.

226
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh, no?

227
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,900
Look, hotshot,

228
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,300
not everyone
wants to be a star.

229
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,800
Sarah is content.

230
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,200
She had
a rotten childhood.

231
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,100
She was diagnosed
as retarded

232
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,500
until she was 7.

233
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,800
We let her know
how smart she was.

234
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
For what?

235
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,200
She's productive.
Pays taxes.

236
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,600
Oh, brother.

237
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
All right.
You want to try?

238
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,700
I'll talk to her.

239
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,900
Huh?

240
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,400
I'll talk to her.

241
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,300
Look at this.
Will you look at this?

242
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Damn!

243
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,200
It's going to cost
$2,000 or $3,000 at least.

244
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,600
Oh, brother.

245
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,400
S-S-Sat.

246
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,500
Sat.

247
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,600
All right.

248
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,000
[Bell Rings]

249
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,200
That's good.

250
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,900
You have to work
on S's, though.

251
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,600
O.K.? Go. Out.

252
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,100
James, Sarah has agreed
to give you an hour.

253
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,500
She's really
looking forward to it.

254
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500
You're really looking
forward to it, aren't you?

255
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,800
What did I tell you?

256
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,500
Well, uh...
have fun, Jim...

257
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,000
as usual.

258
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,400
Well, Sarah, uh...

259
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,100
yeah. I do mind, actually.
Fire laws and all that,

260
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,000
but you go right ahead.

261
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,000
Listen...

262
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,200
how would you like
to fake out Franklin,

263
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,600
make me look real good?

264
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,600
I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.

265
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,500
Uh...

266
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
if...

267
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,100
I...

268
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,200
don't...

269
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,100
sign... faster...

270
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,200
the hour will be over

271
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,800
before I finish
my opening speech.

272
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,800
No. I'm all out of jokes.

273
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,100
Good.

274
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,500
I'm not funny.

275
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Oh, yeah?

276
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:50,300
If you could hear, you'd
think I was a scream.

277
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,800
You're deaf? Well, I'll
try to remember that.

278
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
I'll forget?
No, I won't.

279
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,700
Listen, um... why don't we
get this thing started here?

280
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,000
Well, thank you
for stopping by.

281
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,800
The pleasure was mine.

282
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
God.

283
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,400
My mama.

284
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,500
Your mama.

285
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,900
Great. Go.

286
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,300
Glen, who's your
favorite person?

287
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,100
Twisted Sister?

288
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,000
It's the name
of the rock group.

289
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,900
Oh. Oh.

290
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,300
Try saying that.

291
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,100
Twisted Sister.

292
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,400
Glen, it takes courage.

293
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,300
I know.

294
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,300
Just give me
one sound.

295
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,400
One. "T."

296
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,800
"T."

297
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,900
Try.

298
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,200
"T."

299
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,800
Tweeh...

300
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,800
That's great.

301
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,200
Yeah. Out of here.

302
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,800
Go.

303
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,400
Great.

304
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Johnny?

305
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,300
Who's your
favorite person?

306
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,800
Princess Di?

307
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Benji?

308
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,800
No.

309
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,400
Terminator?

310
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,900
Uh...

311
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,600
[Bell Rings]

312
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,000
Hey.

313
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,500
Hey, you want to play
stand up, sit down again?

314
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,500
Whoa, careful,

315
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,900
you almost smiled.

316
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,800
Ah, that's a girl.

317
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,400
That's the Sarah Norman
we all know and love.

318
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,400
If my jokes
are terrible

319
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
and my signing
is boring,

320
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
what are you
doing here?

321
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,700
There's a whole
empty beach.

322
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,100
Unbelievable.

323
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,400
I tried to call
your mother.

324
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,700
Hey. Hold it.

325
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,800
Wait. Wait.

326
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,200
I can't...

327
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,400
I didn't even talk to her.

328
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,600
O.K.?

329
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,300
I mean, can we stop this?

330
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,300
I mean, why can't we...

331
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,800
I mean, why can't we just...

332
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,500
why don't we...

333
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,100
why don't we...

334
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,700
go out and have
some dinner tonight?

335
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,200
Huh? Just give me
a yes or a no.

336
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,900
Yes?

337
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,300
Good.

338
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,200
I think.

339
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,400
O.K. Um...

340
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,900
I will meet you
behind, uh...

341
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,100
the girls' dormitory,
8:00.

342
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,100
I will whisper
your name.

343
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,900
Hey!

344
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,300
I know that sign.

345
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,900
That's the first sign
I ever learned.

346
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,700
It's in Italian.

347
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,800
Can I suggest something?

348
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,500
Will you
give me a break?

349
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,800
My Italian is worse
than my signing.

350
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,000
The veal piccata
is very good.

351
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,400
Look. I'm sorry.

352
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,600
V-E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A.

353
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,000
I mean, you see,

354
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,900
by the time I finish,

355
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,400
they may be out of it.

356
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,200
It's veal. It's, uh...

357
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,300
sauteed in lemon
and butter.

358
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,700
What's veal?

359
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,100
Uh... God.
What the hell is veal?

360
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,200
Um...

361
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,700
Good evening.

362
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,300
Something to drink
this evening?

363
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,400
You want something
to drink, Sarah?

364
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,000
Our house wine
is very nice.

365
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
You want some wine?

366
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,900
Yeah. It's O.K.

367
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,400
Uh, white wine.

368
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
We'll take a carafe,
please.

369
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,700
He doesn't think
you're stupid.

370
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,400
He thinks
you're deaf.

371
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,000
No. Only stupid
hearing people

372
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,700
think that deaf
people are stupid.

373
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,600
Do you really like
being a cleaning woman?

374
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,600
Why?

375
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,900
Yeah. I mean,
there are other jobs

376
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,100
where a person can
work alone in silence.

377
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Not with toilet bowl
cleaner?

378
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,300
You should have told me
that was the attraction.

379
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,000
You are smart as hell,
you know?

380
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,300
You want to dance?

381
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,700

382
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,500

It's...

469
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,600
my pleasure.

470
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,100
Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.

471
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,700
I didn't call again...

472
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,500
because I would've
hung up again.

473
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,800
It's 60 miles
here and back.

474
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,100
Please,
just five minutes.

475
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,000
I just got home
from work.

476
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,400
This is my time
to relax.

477
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,300
Discussing Sarah
is hardly relaxing.

478
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,400
Five minutes.

479
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,600
Well.

480
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,400
Well. Uh... let's see.

481
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,600
You haven't seen Sarah
in eight years?

482
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,300
Let's get this straight.

483
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,100
Sarah doesn't want
to see me.

484
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,300
Has she said why?

485
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,400
We don't communicate
very well.

486
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,300
Did you ever learn
to sign?

487
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,000
Some of the parents...

488
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,600
I'm really sick
of you people

489
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,500
coming here
every few years

490
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,000
asking the same
questions,

491
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,200
blaming me.

492
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,900
God. No one's
blaming you.

493
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,900
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves.

494
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,900
So, it's all
my fault.

495
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,500
Fine. I don't
give a damn anymore.

496
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,900
I really just came
to ask one question.

497
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,800
What happened when
Sarah tried to speak?

498
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,800
What happened?

499
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,100
She looked awful.

500
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,500
She sounded awful.

501
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,900
People made fun of her.
What do you think?

502
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,800
Who made fun of her?

503
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,400
Other kids.

504
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,500
Her sister's friends.

505
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,100
Then she stopped
trying to talk.

506
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,200
She's very pretty,
you know.

507
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,000
Her sister Ruth had
a bunch of boys hanging around,

508
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,400
and they started
asking Sarah out

509
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,700
when she came home
on weekends.

510
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,700
It was wonderful
for her.

511
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,300
The boys really
liked her.

512
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,100
They treated her
just like they treated Ruth...

513
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,700
with respect.

514
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,600
If you didn't know
there was a problem,

515
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,500
you would've thought
she's perfectly normal.

516
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Hi.

517
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,800
It's true.
I'm early today.

518
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,300
No. Don't go.

519
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,200
I wanted to talk
to you, anyway.

520
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,300
No. I want to hel...

521
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,800
work with you.

522
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,500
I understand
that you're scared.

523
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,100
I understand nothing.

524
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,600
Sarah! Come back here.

525
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Sarah.

526
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,500
Yelling at the back
of a deaf person.

527
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,900
Very good, James.

528
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,200
He's been at
all the best schools.

529
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,900
Why did you stop
going home?

530
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,100
Did your sister's
friends,

531
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,700
those boys that you
were going out with,

532
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,300
did they have anything
to do with it?

533
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
Yes. I talked
to your mother.

534
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,500
Please, let me
help you, damn it!

535
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,600
How?

536
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,500
By showing you
the joys of sex

537
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,900
with a hearing man?

538
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,600
I think that's
one language you don't speak.

539
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,200
Yeah, O.K. I'm so...

540
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,400
Come on.
I can take it.

541
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,900
You have more than enough
communication skills.

542
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,800
I don't.
<i>They</i> never did?

543
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
O.K.

544
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,900

00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,100

Hearing boys?

548
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,700
They could never be bothered
to learn my language.

549
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,900
I was always expected
to learn to speak.

550
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Well, I don't speak.

551
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,800
Sex was always
something I could do

552
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,700
as well as hearing girls.

553
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,200
Better!

554
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,600
At first,
I let them have me

555
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,100
because they wanted to.

556
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,700
Before long,
the boys were lined up

557
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,800

my sister kept for me.

to a dark place and...

560

They didn't even take me out
for a Coke first.

561
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,800
That's not what
I wanted to know about you.

562

such a big deal...

563
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,300

giving her a thrill.

564

No, Sarah.

565
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,200
All the time,
you were laughing at me.

566
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,700

"poor little deaf virgin

568
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,100

threatened by that?

You think that I give
a good goddamn

570
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,000
that you fucked every
pimply-faced teenager?

571
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,400
I don't.
