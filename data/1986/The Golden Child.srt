1
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:43,770
Don't let him touch you!

2
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:53,475
<i>Butt Pie.</i>

3
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:58,948
There's a sequel to a book written
called <i>Butt Cake.</i>

4
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:03,917
Very popular at the news-stands.
About a butt with cake all over it.

5
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:11,287
<i>Chunky Asses?</i>

6
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:19,287
<i>Welcome to the Mel Backman Journal.</i>
<i>I'm Mel Backman.</i>

7
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:22,364
<i>With me today is Chandler Jarrell</i>

8
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:26,730
<i>who's doing something</i>
<i>very vital for the community.</i>

9
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:30,771
<i>Chandler is a finder of lost children.</i>
<i>Am I correct?</i>

10
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:35,241
- <i>Yes, I find missing children.</i>
- <i>That's very interesting.</i>

11
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:40,247
<i>There was a show called Finder</i>
<i>of Lost Loves. Did you see that?</i>

12
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:43,079
- <i>Tony Franciosa was the star.</i>
- <i>Yeah...</i>

13
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:46,120
- <i>I'm looking for this girl...</i>
- <i>I hope you're not nervous.</i>

14
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:51,317
<i>It's perfectly normal. This is</i>
<i>my fifth show and I'm still nervous.</i>

15
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:56,057
<i>In fact, is there anyone here</i>
<i>who's not nervous? Are you nervous?</i>

16
00:08:56,233 --> 00:09:00,101
<i>I'm trying to find this girl, Cheryl Mosely,</i>
<i>who disappeared a while back...</i>

17
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,333
<i>This is wonderful. It's what</i>
<i>the programme is all about.</i>

18
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:11,345
<i>When I came here, I told them I didn't</i>
<i>want to be another Merv or Johnny.</i>

19
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:16,851
<i>I want to do the kind of programming</i>
<i>that's responsive to the community.</i>

20
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,252
<i>I'm trying to find Cheryl Mosely.</i>
<i>She's four foot, eleven...</i>

21
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:23,892
<i>This is wonderful.</i>

22
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:31,065
<i>If I want to get into your line of work,</i>
<i>is there a course I can take?</i>

23
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:35,068
- <i>Youjust have to care about children.</i>
- <i>Do you recommend this line of work?</i>

24
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:40,107
- <i>Can you make a lot of money?</i>
- <i>She's 16...</i>

25
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:43,804
<i>This is off the subject,</i>
<i>but that's a wonderful hat.</i>

26
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,210
<i>Where did you get that?</i>

27
00:09:46,383 --> 00:09:51,446
- <i>She's 16 and I'm trying to find her...</i>
- <i>Great, let's say you do find her.</i>

28
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:55,580
<i>What would be the first thing</i>
<i>you'd say to her?</i>

29
00:09:57,627 --> 00:10:02,064
- <i>Her name is Cheryl Mosely...</i>
- <i>Thank you, Chandler.</i>

30
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:05,429
<i>Let's talk about tortoises.</i>
<i>What have you got here?</i>

31
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:08,503
- <i>This is Teddy who is 80 years old.</i>
- <i>80?</i>

32
00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:11,072
- <i>Isn't he darling?</i>
- <i>Teddy can kiss my ass.</i>

33
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:14,210
<i>I'm trying to find this girl,</i>
<i>Cheryl Mosely.</i>

34
00:10:14,377 --> 00:10:17,005
<i>She was last seen</i>
<i>on Vineland in North Hollywood.</i>

35
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:22,345
<i>She had on a sweater and a skirt.</i>
<i>Call me on 4688492 if you have...</i>

36
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,388
<i>Shut up. If you have any information</i>
<i>about her, please contact me.</i>

37
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:31,186
<i>If you don't put the camera back,</i>
<i>I'll bust your ass. Leave it on me.</i>

38
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:35,320
<i>Cheryl Mosely, Chandler Jarrell,</i>
<i>24 hours a day, 4688492.</i>

39
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:39,764
<i>Now you can talk with the tortoises.</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

40
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:42,404
<i>Thank you. That was Chandler Jarrell.</i>

41
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:44,437
<i>You've had a sex change?</i>

42
00:10:57,621 --> 00:11:00,681
OK, let's go. Take it slow, now.
Tie him, tie him.

43
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:03,849
Why are you hanging
in the back of the court?

44
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:08,293
Let's go. There you go.
All the way, boys. It's you!

45
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:10,626
Yes!

46
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:13,866
All right, come on, now.

47
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:18,338
What's wrong with you, Scrub?

48
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:21,037
Scrub.

49
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:28,982
- Good afternoon, Mr Jarrell.
- Hi.

50
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:33,054
- So you're the finder of lost children.
- You must have seen me on TV.

51
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:37,990
- Yeah, I like working with children.
- Hey, Chandler, come on!

52
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:39,924
Shut up!

53
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:44,593
- A child has been kidnapped.
- When?

54
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:47,601
Five days ago in north-eastern Tibet.

55
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:50,137
Tibet's a little bit
out of my territory.

56
00:11:50,307 --> 00:11:52,798
This child is special.

57
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:56,503
- His destiny is to save the world.
- That's a good destiny.

58
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,308
Chandler, throw the ball!

59
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:00,972
Here!

60
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,212
400 years ago, the Neuchung Oracle
predicted that the <i>Gompen Tarma,</i>

61
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:07,549
that is Tibetan for "Golden Child",

62
00:12:07,724 --> 00:12:10,887
would be taken to the new city,
the City of the Angels.

63
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:13,529
He would be rescued by
a man who is no angel.

64
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:15,722
- Who is that?
- You.

65
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,894
Yeah, right. OK.

66
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,268
I'm in the middle of a basketball game,
although I'd love to stay and chat.

67
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:29,601
- This looks like a big joint.
- I'm serious, Mr Jarrell.

68
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,247
Lick it and smoke it.

69
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:36,918
I think there were two of these,
and you smoked the other one.

70
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:40,314
Put it in your bag
and stop smoking scrolls.

71
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,553
It looks like a joint. You might get
jumped by Rastafarians, so put it away.

72
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:48,425
Excuse me, I have a game to play.
It was a nice thought.

73
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:51,226
I realise it's hard for you to take in,

74
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:53,494
but it's your destiny
to find the Golden Child.

75
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,730
And it's your destiny
to seek psychiatric help.

76
00:12:56,906 --> 00:13:00,433
Really. Can I go and play now?
Please, go home?

77
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,011
Excuse me.
And such a cute girl, too.

78
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,011
Dope fiend!

79
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:14,918
- Is that her?
- Yes, that's Cheryl Mosely.

80
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:19,050
- How long has she been missing?
- About three weeks.

81
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,425
- What have you got?
- Not much.

82
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:28,196
Three days ago, the rental sign goes
down and a truck backs up to the door.

83
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:31,431
The neighbours hear a continuous,
low murmur night and day.

84
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:35,738
At ten last night, the truck pulls up again
and the murmuring stops.

85
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:40,349
A neighbour comes out to shut up
his dog who won't come down the hill.

86
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:43,577
He looks over the fence
and finds the body.

87
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:56,521
- Who rented the place?
- She did. By phone, mailed in cash.

88
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:01,735
- Did you take the referral I sent you?
- No.

89
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:06,501
- You only take the kid cases.
- Yeah.

90
00:14:06,676 --> 00:14:09,645
Get a few more shots in here.

91
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:51,977
Ms Tibet, you can come out now.
Stop following me, I won't take your case.

92
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:54,673
You're already on it.

93
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:58,582
What makes you think
the kid was in the house?

94
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:04,220
This is a restraint curse. They must
restrain him spiritually and physically.

95
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:08,194
They need to keep evil on him
on all four sides of him at all times.

96
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:12,198
Just the writing isn't enough.
They'd need something else.

97
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:15,462
- Or what?
- Or the child projects himself astrally.

98
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:24,577
Give me a break.

99
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:31,044
You're telling me
that the people that killed Cheryl...

100
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,089
If I find them, they're the same people
that kidnapped the...

101
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,227
...the Golden Child. Exactly.

102
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:39,884
Right.

103
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:42,588
- But why would they kill Cheryl?
- I don't know.

104
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:46,496
- Why are they feeding the kid blood?
- Are you sure?

105
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:50,196
- I found a bowl of oatmeal...
- Yes?

106
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:54,173
...with some blood on the bottom of it.
It's probably hers.

107
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:59,808
I don't know. There is somebody
we could ask about the blood.

108
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:03,009
This is LA, though. You're going to
ask somebody about the blood?

109
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:06,849
Are they in this world
or do we have to project there?

110
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:09,124
Some part of the galaxy...

111
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:25,270
Mr Jarrell, you honour my shop
with your presence.

112
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:34,844
He's very pleased
to meet a man as great as you.

113
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:36,986
How do you say "Thank you"?

114
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:49,696
We must speak to Kala.

115
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
OK... Hey!

116
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:15,454
Mr Jarrell.

117
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:28,603
You may speak with her.
She can hear you.

118
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:34,903
Tell me about the Golden Child.

119
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:39,412
Every thousand generations,
a perfect child is born.

120
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:43,111
A Golden Child.

121
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:45,584
He has come to rescue us.

122
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:51,052
- Rescue us from what?
- From ourselves.

123
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:54,988
He is the Bringer of Compassion.

124
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:58,964
If he dies, compassion will die with him.

125
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:01,933
If something happens to the kid,
the whole world goes to hell?

126
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:05,370
The world will become hell!

127
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:10,311
It's not far from that now!
Who would want to take the kid?

128
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,109
Those who want evil rather than good.

129
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:22,046
- Can you be more specific?
- We do not know who took him.

130
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:25,888
Could you tell me why
they are trying to make him eat blood?

131
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:28,963
Nothing in this world will hurt him.

132
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:34,126
But if he were to pollute himself
with anything impure,

133
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:36,863
he would become vulnerable.

134
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,634
OK. So if <i>they...</i>

135
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,973
If he eats the blood, they can kill him.

136
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:46,274
Yes.

137
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,078
Do you have any other questions?

138
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:54,419
As a matter of fact I do.

139
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,856
What are you doing this weekend,
because your silhouette is kicking!

140
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:06,699
She plays the maraccas, too?

141
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:12,337
- This is the Chosen One?
- Yes...

142
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:15,909
You people put on a good show.
Where did you find her?

143
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:19,138
She's the librarian
at the Secret Repository at Palkor Sin.

144
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:23,615
She was flown here to help us.
She's over 300 years old.

145
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:28,553
- How did she manage that one?
- An ancestor was raped by a dragon.

146
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,261
Does that happen a lot
where you're from?

147
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:49,603
I'm sorry I got a little harsh.
Why don't you come up?

148
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:51,076
No, thank you.

149
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:02,886
- What is it?
- The spirits, the spirits...

150
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:10,696
A spirit's just told me that
you should come up for a little while,

151
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:14,530
have a drink,
and wait for further instructions.

152
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:23,237
I'm sorry. Why don't you come up
for a while? I'll be good.

153
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,409
OK.

154
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:30,077
I tried.

155
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:34,690
You should always give a woman
two chances to say no, just in case.

156
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:36,415
That's "no", twice.

157
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:40,961
All right... but the spirits
are going to be very upset.

158
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:45,189
You know, I am the Chosen One.

159
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:53,903
OK.

160
00:24:26,662 --> 00:24:29,130
You <i>will</i> eat.

161
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:36,561
Get this, and the rest of your playthings,
out of here.

162
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:27,705
Hey, bird!

163
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:32,013
Did you just see a little Hare Krishna
midget in a tree, floating?

164
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:39,021
Or is it me?
That must be Rod Serling.

165
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:43,795
- Yeah?
- <i>Are you looking for Cheryl Mosely?</i>

166
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:48,232
- Yeah.
- <i>I know the bastards who grabbed her.</i>

167
00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:52,101
- Who was she with?
- <i>Have you ever been in Pacoima?</i>

168
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:55,266
- Yeah. Who was she with?
- <i>Behind the freeway there's a house.</i>

169
00:26:55,444 --> 00:26:58,470
<i>It's a pad for some bikers</i>
<i>called the Yellow Dragons.</i>

170
00:26:58,647 --> 00:27:01,377
<i>She was with them last week.</i>
<i>She isn't there now.</i>

171
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,815
Who is this? Hello?

172
00:27:40,222 --> 00:27:42,554
- What is it?
- Nothing.

173
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,925
I came prepared
in case we had any other eventualities.

174
00:27:48,097 --> 00:27:51,624
Listen, you wait here.

175
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,566
If there's a problem, you leave.
Now, what are you going to do?

176
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:58,832
- I'll stay here.
- No. You stay here now.

177
00:27:59,675 --> 00:28:03,202
If there's a problem,
get behind the wheel and drive away.

178
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:06,473
- Understand me? You got that?
- Yes.

179
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:09,174
Stay... leave. OK.

180
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:36,876
I won't hurt anybody.
I don't want any trouble.

181
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:44,316
No trouble... I'm sorry,
I just want some chips, that's all.

182
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:47,478
All I want is chips. A chip, that's it.

183
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:50,454
Turn that over, it's burning.

184
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:53,254
I just want some chips.

185
00:29:35,604 --> 00:29:38,402
May I ask you a couple of questions?

186
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:22,243
- That ought to hold him.
- Yeah, that ought to hold him.

187
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,583
Hey, hey, hey! In my pocket,
there's a whole thing of Tic Tacs.

188
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:31,191
Take as many as you like. Please.

189
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:28,511
What are you doing here?

190
00:31:29,218 --> 00:31:30,651
Hey!

191
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:45,392
I'll bust your brain, asshole!

192
00:32:10,526 --> 00:32:15,190
Why did you come in here?
I told you to stay in the car!

193
00:32:15,364 --> 00:32:18,299
I'm not going to turn this into a lecture,

194
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:21,061
but next time I tell you
to do something, you do it.

195
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:25,935
This is a man thing. This is no place
for a woman to be, understand?

196
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:30,275
Next time I tell you to do something, do it.
I don't want you to get hurt.

197
00:32:30,445 --> 00:32:33,608
- Can I handle this, OK?
- OK.

198
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:39,115
Leave me alone, asshole.

199
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:45,118
A girl tattooed with a yellow dragon
was here. What happened to her?

200
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:46,955
What girl?

201
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:54,702
- I've never seen her before.
- OK.

202
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,369
Oh, Cheryl!

203
00:33:03,545 --> 00:33:06,309
Yeah, her... We sold her.

204
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:12,979
What do you mean?
You sold her to who?

205
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:17,114
To Tommy Tong. He's got that
restaurant down on Broadway.

206
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:24,164
We traded her for a case of cigarettes
and a quart of pork fried rice.

207
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,097
Why would somebody
want to buy somebody?

208
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:29,669
- He needed a girl.
- For what?

209
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:34,969
He worked out a deal with the Devil.
He said he needed her blood.

210
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:44,476
Look, you're going to go over
and rough him up, huh?

211
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:47,121
Don't tell him I told you.

212
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:52,249
Why would I do that?
Let me get this right.

213
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:58,423
- So you sold her?
- Yeah, we sold her.

214
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:10,672
Wait here.

215
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:31,791
I'm looking for Tommy Tong.

216
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:36,293
Stop acting stupid,
the man owns the place, all right?

217
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:40,706
I'm looking for Tommy Tong.

218
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:46,208
You don't speak English?
Let me translate it.

219
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:49,145
Bring Tommy Tong here
or I'll bust your ass.

220
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:51,080
You understand that?

221
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:55,383
You see this dead girl? The last time
she was seen alive was with Tong.

222
00:34:55,557 --> 00:34:58,549
Tell Mr Tong that he has a guest
or I'll bust your ass!

223
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:13,737
Let me show you
how I feel about that karate shit, OK?

224
00:35:39,634 --> 00:35:43,832
How did you do that?
What was that... with the flip?

225
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:45,932
- You killed him.
- I didn't kill him!

226
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:48,296
- What happened?
- I don't know.

227
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,236
Maybe the guy cut himself shaving
and bled to death looking for a Kleenex.

228
00:36:52,407 --> 00:36:54,375
Really, I... Hey!

229
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:58,104
Maybe the guy thought
that I was coming,

230
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,115
got scared and figured, "What the hell?"
And killed himself.

231
00:37:06,421 --> 00:37:09,083
- You buy that?
- No.

232
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:10,485
Neither do I.

233
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:13,856
We may be up against
supernatural creatures.

234
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:15,326
- What?
- Demons.

235
00:37:26,808 --> 00:37:31,404
By the time he finds you,
it will be too late.

236
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:15,115
<i>You were wise to kill Tommy Tong.</i>

237
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,418
<i>He was weak,</i>
<i>he might have betrayed us.</i>

238
00:38:18,593 --> 00:38:20,026
Thank you, Lord.

239
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:23,323
<i>But why is the child still alive?</i>

240
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:25,830
You have no reason to fear him.

241
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:30,028
He's surrounded at all times
and in all the four directions by evil.

242
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:32,696
<i>Do not underestimate</i>
<i>the power of good</i>

243
00:38:32,874 --> 00:38:35,502
<i>and do not dismiss</i>
<i>the strength of the child.</i>

244
00:38:35,677 --> 00:38:38,669
<i>Time grows short.</i>
<i>The child will never eat the blood.</i>

245
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:40,280
What must I do?

246
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:44,145
<i>Move the child before</i>
<i>the Chosen One draws near.</i>

247
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:47,117
- And to kill him?
- <i>The Ajanti Dagger.</i>

248
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:50,781
<i>It is not of this world.</i>
<i>With it, you could kill the child.</i>

249
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:54,986
- But it's so well-guarded. How can I...?
- <i>Offer to exchange the child for it.</i>

250
00:38:55,163 --> 00:38:58,257
<i>They can refuse nothing</i>
<i>for his safe return.</i>

251
00:38:58,433 --> 00:39:03,837
<i>Use the Ajanti Dagger.</i>
<i>With it, you need no other evil.</i>

252
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:07,372
<i>Use the dagger to kill the child.</i>

253
00:40:40,935 --> 00:40:43,699
It's good to see you, Mr Jarrell.

254
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,345
Get your monkey off my back.

255
00:40:53,882 --> 00:40:57,579
Of course. Fu, please retire.

256
00:40:57,752 --> 00:41:00,220
Yeah, Fu. Save it.

257
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:05,487
Wait a second...

258
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:10,222
Wait a second, this is a dream.
I'm dreaming! Hey...

259
00:41:10,398 --> 00:41:12,229
Why do you say that?

260
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,494
Because of people like Fu
with his monkey face,

261
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,002
the big-headed guy,
the fat dude and you.

262
00:41:18,173 --> 00:41:20,539
You don't exist, it's a dream.

263
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:24,701
Perhaps I've had you brought here
to make you an attractive offer.

264
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:28,906
I don't think I can accept a proposal
this early in the season.

265
00:41:34,689 --> 00:41:36,680
Thank you.

266
00:41:37,292 --> 00:41:43,356
Has it occurred to you how many men
of less worth have attained so much,

267
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:46,500
while you, who can imagine so much,
have so little?

268
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:50,661
No, I'm not that lucky.
I don't have that much imagination.

269
00:41:59,848 --> 00:42:01,907
I don't like your attitude.

270
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:05,712
This is a nice jacket. It's got a
"Morris Day" feel and looks good on you.

271
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:07,980
And the boots... smoking.

272
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:14,253
I'll repeat my offer one last time.

273
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:17,990
I am dreaming, so I can say anything
and get away with it.

274
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:22,626
So I think I'll say, from my heart...

275
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:26,067
Kiss my ass.

276
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,402
Kiss my ass!

277
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:32,443
I can see that it's pointless
talking to you.

278
00:42:32,614 --> 00:42:36,516
Why do you insist on mispronouncing
my name, leaving the "J" silent?

279
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:40,780
- My name is "Jarrell" with a "J".
- Yes, I know.

280
00:42:40,955 --> 00:42:42,923
My legs are more attractive.

281
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:47,255
I'm willing to make an exchange.
The child for the Ajanti Dagger.

282
00:42:56,538 --> 00:42:59,473
This is just a reminder of the evening.

283
00:42:59,641 --> 00:43:02,974
Something so that
you will know that you were here.

284
00:43:03,144 --> 00:43:07,240
- You don't feel pain in your dream!
- You'll remember this for a long time.

285
00:43:07,415 --> 00:43:10,509
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

286
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:15,816
Do you have any methyolate or
mercurochrome, it might get infected?

287
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,926
Tell your friends that
Sardo Numspa sends his greetings.

288
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,641
It's a mistake.

289
00:43:44,886 --> 00:43:46,683
- Kee!
- Chandler!

290
00:43:51,526 --> 00:43:54,017
They've tied you up in toilet paper.

291
00:43:54,195 --> 00:43:57,392
- What are you doing here?
- I have to be here, it's my dream.

292
00:43:57,565 --> 00:44:00,159
Listen, I think
the kid is here somewhere.

293
00:44:00,335 --> 00:44:02,462
- We should find the kid together.
- Yes.

294
00:44:02,637 --> 00:44:06,437
- Afterwards, we could spend some...
...time together!

295
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:10,840
- Yes, kind of let nature...
...take its course.

296
00:44:11,746 --> 00:44:13,373
Yeah.

297
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:51,585
So, it is Sardo Numspa.

298
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,219
- What's this knife?
- The Crossed Dagger of Ajanti.

299
00:44:57,925 --> 00:45:02,760
They brought it to this world
to kill the second Golden Child,

300
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,592
the Bearer of Justice.

301
00:45:05,767 --> 00:45:08,463
His death was a great loss.

302
00:45:08,636 --> 00:45:13,630
Sardo needs it to kill the child,
but you can only use it to save him.

303
00:45:13,808 --> 00:45:18,836
You must obtain the knife and
lure Numspa into freeing the child.

304
00:45:19,013 --> 00:45:22,949
You must never let him
get possession of the knife.

305
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:25,642
That sounds like a neat trick.
How can I pull it off?

306
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:34,555
If need be, we will exchange
the dagger for the child.

307
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:37,163
If the Abbot of Karma Tang
will let us have it.

308
00:45:37,332 --> 00:45:41,860
If the kid's so important, why
doesn't this guy give you the dagger?

309
00:45:42,036 --> 00:45:44,630
He's a very difficult man.

310
00:45:46,007 --> 00:45:49,636
Tomorrow, you will go with
Kee Nang to Tibet to obtain the dagger.

311
00:45:49,811 --> 00:45:54,475
I ain't going to Tibet because I had
a crazy dream. This is ridiculous.

312
00:45:54,649 --> 00:45:57,777
- Only the Chosen One can get the knife.
- Will you go?

313
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:05,822
Listen, this Chosen One thing
is going too far, OK?

314
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:09,156
This is not normal, OK?

315
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,457
I'm not saying no,
but I have to think it over,

316
00:46:11,632 --> 00:46:15,466
because the Chosen One thing...
too far.

317
00:46:15,636 --> 00:46:18,901
- Could you leave us for a moment?
- Yes, you talk it over.

318
00:46:19,073 --> 00:46:21,735
This is not a normal thing
and it should be discussed.

319
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:24,571
Because it's not normal. Talk.

320
00:46:24,746 --> 00:46:30,082
Chosen One, I'm the Chosen One...
Why...? Tibet...

321
00:46:31,252 --> 00:46:33,743
Why can't I be chosen
to go to the Bahamas?

322
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:37,914
I've got to get chosen to go to Tibet.
This is really...

323
00:46:38,092 --> 00:46:42,188
And Kala, you're not a normal chick.
You're too shy and need to open up.

324
00:46:42,363 --> 00:46:44,593
You can't sit in a basement,
naked, smoking,

325
00:46:44,766 --> 00:46:48,202
looking at soap operas
for the rest of your life.

326
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:10,082
- Yak loin.
- What is it?

327
00:47:10,258 --> 00:47:16,925
- Yak loin. Good to keep the Yang up.
- Nothing wrong with my Yang.

328
00:47:21,636 --> 00:47:24,127
How does
this dream transmission work?

329
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:28,173
- Part's dream and part's real.
- So the scar on my arm's real?

330
00:47:28,342 --> 00:47:29,673
Right.

331
00:47:29,844 --> 00:47:33,007
- What about "Numsy"?
- Numspa. Sardo Numspa.

332
00:47:33,181 --> 00:47:35,046
- Yes.
- He's very real.

333
00:47:35,216 --> 00:47:38,481
You were there and said things
that seemed pretty real.

334
00:47:38,653 --> 00:47:41,622
- That part was dream.
- Just checking.

335
00:47:54,435 --> 00:47:56,426
Aren't you going to ask me up?

336
00:48:00,374 --> 00:48:03,400
- Am I dreaming now?
- Does a lady have to ask twice?

337
00:48:03,578 --> 00:48:07,674
No! No... Please, twice!

338
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:09,180
Please, please.

339
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,648
Shit! Twice!

340
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:25,931
I didn't know whether you wanted
cream or sugar, so I left it black.

341
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,536
I want you to go to Tibet.
Will you go?

342
00:48:29,704 --> 00:48:33,572
Wait a second. It's really cold in Tibet,
and I don't like the cold.

343
00:48:33,741 --> 00:48:38,178
Why don't we just stay here
all weekend long under the covers,

344
00:48:38,346 --> 00:48:42,282
watching television, sweating,
smiling and everything?

345
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:45,783
- You won't go.
- It's freezing in Tibet.

346
00:48:45,953 --> 00:48:49,719
- Hey, where are you going?
- Tibet.

347
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:54,055
But I'm the Chosen One.
You can't get the knife.

348
00:49:00,301 --> 00:49:02,997
I'll go. I'll go to Tibet.

349
00:49:04,071 --> 00:49:05,834
Wait...

350
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:09,738
But if it's really cold,
we have to come back here. OK?

351
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:14,343
You are not in a rush
to leave this minute, are you?

352
00:49:14,515 --> 00:49:17,040
Because, you know...

353
00:49:21,689 --> 00:49:24,556
A bed! Is that a bed?

354
00:50:15,476 --> 00:50:17,637
Kathmandu is the gateway to Tibet.

355
00:50:17,812 --> 00:50:20,610
There are bulls walking around here.
And it's cold.

356
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:23,773
Two days into the mountains
and we'll be at the heights of heaven.

357
00:50:23,951 --> 00:50:29,082
I thought this was the best part.
I'm freezing, I'm not enjoying myself.

358
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:32,589
But I want you to know
that I'll do my best to find the child.

359
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,856
Of course you are. I'll arrange
for our trek into the mountains.

360
00:50:37,031 --> 00:50:39,727
You have about an hour to look around.

361
00:51:24,445 --> 00:51:27,846
About 16:30,
but I won't make it to the party.

362
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:11,318
Hi.

363
00:52:15,996 --> 00:52:18,487
Take it easy.

364
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:24,665
You want me to buy a necklace?
OK, I'll buy one.

365
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:27,865
I'll buy one.
Can you let me have the blue one?

366
00:52:28,042 --> 00:52:31,307
I don't know
how much they cost, though.

367
00:52:32,113 --> 00:52:34,877
One of those? OK.

368
00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:38,280
Let me have the blue one,
it matches my coat.

369
00:52:44,859 --> 00:52:47,657
Wait a second, you took 100!

370
00:52:47,828 --> 00:52:52,925
No, one dollar is for you.
See George Washington?

371
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,125
That's Benjamin Franklin,
that's not happening.

372
00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:57,770
Give this... You got the wrong money.

373
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:04,776
Can I have my money back?

374
00:53:06,213 --> 00:53:11,981
- You gave me the wrong necklace, too.
- You're breaking my heart, asswipe.

375
00:53:12,153 --> 00:53:16,214
- You speak English just fine.
- So do you, so what of it?

376
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:20,759
Give me my 100 back, take this dollar
and give me the right one.

377
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:24,796
Monkey breath, puke face,
eater of turtle slime.

378
00:53:27,234 --> 00:53:30,635
- Give me my shit and take your shit.
- What, scuzzbucket?

379
00:53:30,805 --> 00:53:33,069
OK, you slick shithead.

380
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,800
You sneaky little bastard!

381
00:53:35,976 --> 00:53:38,410
You want your money? Take it!

382
00:54:00,868 --> 00:54:04,304
Did you see a little naked man
with a $100 bill?

383
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:07,201
I have arranged for
yaks, ponies and boats.

384
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:10,036
You didn't see a naked bum
with $100?

385
00:54:10,211 --> 00:54:13,112
No, but I can arrange for one. Come on.

386
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,876
You've got to show up sooner or later.
When you do, your ass is kicked.

387
00:54:18,052 --> 00:54:22,989
I'll sell your clothes, leave you here
naked and bleeding without money.

388
00:54:23,157 --> 00:54:26,490
Little dirty bastard!
Dude took my money.

389
00:54:30,664 --> 00:54:33,599
If that bum hadn't taken my $100,
we'd have a boat with a motor.

390
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:37,032
- Shut up and paddle.
- Yeah, I'm gonna paddle.

391
00:54:37,204 --> 00:54:41,300
I'm gonna paddle your ass
when I find you. I'll use this row.

392
00:54:41,475 --> 00:54:44,569
I'm gonna row your ass till it bleeds!

393
00:54:57,524 --> 00:55:02,826
- We'll be there soon.
- You'd better have a spatula.

394
00:55:02,997 --> 00:55:05,124
My ass is frozen to this yak.

395
00:55:49,843 --> 00:55:51,310
Bow.

396
00:55:57,451 --> 00:56:00,249
That's the dude who took my money!

397
00:56:08,095 --> 00:56:12,555
We have come to ask for
the sacred Crossed Dagger of Ajanti.

398
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:17,193
- For what reason?
- For the Golden Child.

399
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:22,172
- He does not need it.
- To save his life.

400
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:26,609
The child lives for our sakes,
not for his own.

401
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,876
I humbly beg you,
let us have the knife.

402
00:56:33,787 --> 00:56:36,585
Let him ask it.

403
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,997
I-I-I... want the knife.

404
00:56:57,945 --> 00:57:00,505
Let him ask again.

405
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:18,122
I want the knife.

406
00:57:18,999 --> 00:57:21,365
Please.

407
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:39,647
Only a man whose heart is pure
can wield the knife.

408
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,187
If you're such a man,
you will have it.

409
00:57:45,225 --> 00:57:49,559
"Only a man whose heart is pure
can wield the knife."

410
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:54,190
And only a man whose ass is narrow
can get down these steps.

411
00:57:54,368 --> 00:57:57,826
And if mine is such an ass,
then I shall have it.

412
00:58:00,707 --> 00:58:02,868
Oh, shit.

413
00:58:03,043 --> 00:58:05,773
Beyond the door is a corridor.

414
00:58:05,946 --> 00:58:09,575
At the other end
is the sacred Ajanti Dagger.

415
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:14,119
If you walk to the other end of
the corridor and retrieve it, it's yours.

416
00:58:14,288 --> 00:58:17,553
- That sounds simple enough.
- Just one thing.

417
00:58:17,724 --> 00:58:20,625
You must carry this glass of water
without spilling one drop.

418
00:58:20,794 --> 00:58:24,230
Are you Monty Hall now?
You must be Carol Marrow.

419
00:58:24,398 --> 00:58:27,333
"Don't spill any water."
This is crazy!

420
00:58:27,501 --> 00:58:30,493
And keep your thought
as pure as the water.

421
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:33,367
- The water isn't pure.
- Neither are you!

422
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,533
I give you this advice. Stay on the path.

423
00:58:38,612 --> 00:58:40,307
You've got it.

424
00:58:44,418 --> 00:58:47,444
I'm so afraid of the dark, too.

425
00:59:03,804 --> 00:59:07,831
You need to get somebody
to come and clean up down here!

426
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:37,532
This is a piece of cake.
This is a piece of cake, OK?

427
00:59:43,377 --> 00:59:46,005
Come on, come on...

428
00:59:51,785 --> 00:59:54,720
Hey, there's no floor.
There's no ground.

429
00:59:54,888 --> 00:59:57,118
Wait a minute, I've got it.

430
00:59:57,291 --> 01:00:01,284
There is a ground. You're making it
look like there's no ground,

431
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:06,194
to see if I would be scared
and run back.

432
01:00:07,467 --> 01:00:10,925
There's a ground, Monty!

433
01:00:31,758 --> 01:00:35,023
There's no ground here!

434
01:00:35,195 --> 01:00:37,288
Oh, shit...

435
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:56,880
- <i>Remember, stay on the path!</i>
- I heard you the first time!

436
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:00,315
Let's just hope the path stays under me!

437
01:01:37,224 --> 01:01:40,785
- But I was supposed to stay on the path!
- <i>Yes.</i>

438
01:01:40,961 --> 01:01:43,794
<i>But you must know</i>
<i>when to break the rules.</i>

439
01:01:43,964 --> 01:01:47,798
- How many have survived this test?
- <i>None!</i>

440
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:50,734
None?

441
01:01:51,305 --> 01:01:56,072
None? I'm going to break your ass,
when I get out of here.

442
01:02:56,937 --> 01:02:59,633
What am I doing wrong?

443
01:03:00,307 --> 01:03:03,299
I followed all your rules,
what am I doing wrong?

444
01:03:07,214 --> 01:03:11,548
Keep your thoughts as pure
as the water and don't drop the water.

445
01:03:11,718 --> 01:03:14,312
Don't drop the water.

446
01:03:16,256 --> 01:03:19,157
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

447
01:03:19,326 --> 01:03:22,318
The water...
The fire and the water...

448
01:03:22,496 --> 01:03:24,259
OK.

449
01:03:29,302 --> 01:03:30,769
To Monty!

450
01:03:31,772 --> 01:03:33,637
A toast!

451
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:58,320
I've got the knife,
now turn on the goddamn light!

452
01:04:10,043 --> 01:04:12,739
What is it, asswipe?

453
01:04:16,883 --> 01:04:20,114
I want to ask your advice
about something.

454
01:04:21,254 --> 01:04:24,223
I'll let that slide,
because it's your way.

455
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:27,551
Don't press your luck, though.

456
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:36,568
I know that you're
a very old and wise and...

457
01:04:37,537 --> 01:04:39,596
...disgusting guy.

458
01:04:41,608 --> 01:04:43,508
You'll wipe that on yourjacket, huh?

459
01:04:43,677 --> 01:04:47,909
I was wondering what a man says
to a woman from your world,

460
01:04:48,081 --> 01:04:52,677
when he wants her to understand that
he loves her and wants to marry her.

461
01:04:53,553 --> 01:04:57,990
If you took the short path and reached
enlightenment before tomorrow,

462
01:04:58,158 --> 01:05:01,218
who would want you for a husband?

463
01:05:01,394 --> 01:05:05,854
- What's the short path?
- First of all, you must remain pure.

464
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:09,729
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

465
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:17,441
Oh, you mean no...

466
01:05:20,947 --> 01:05:24,883
- Is there a long way?
- It takes 10,000 lifetimes.

467
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:28,680
We don't have that much time.
No women, what else?

468
01:05:28,855 --> 01:05:34,851
For you? You must trust someone
you have no reason to trust.

469
01:05:35,028 --> 01:05:39,089
You must make a promise
to someone you have just met.

470
01:05:39,266 --> 01:05:42,292
You must love someone
who loves you.

471
01:05:45,338 --> 01:05:50,071
- How can I know when to do all that?
- That's for you to decide.

472
01:05:51,411 --> 01:05:55,279
You must tell no one
that I have put you on the path.

473
01:05:57,851 --> 01:06:01,844
Well, thanks for your help.

474
01:06:02,022 --> 01:06:04,786
He thinks I helped him!

475
01:06:05,959 --> 01:06:10,726
Get that booger off yourjacket before
it freezes and you scratch yourself.

476
01:06:13,033 --> 01:06:17,993
Keep that $100. There's no telling what
might be on the bill, when you return it!

477
01:06:30,283 --> 01:06:35,311
Gompa? I have ruined myself
for the American.

478
01:06:35,488 --> 01:06:38,616
- He's a fool.
- But he's brave.

479
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:42,728
- He's irresponsible.
- But he's generous.

480
01:06:43,797 --> 01:06:47,733
He thinks of nothing
but protecting his own feelings.

481
01:06:49,436 --> 01:06:53,600
But if you touch his heart,
there's nothing he wouldn't do for you.

482
01:06:53,773 --> 01:06:56,139
He believes in nothing.

483
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:59,608
And still he does what is right.

484
01:06:59,779 --> 01:07:02,907
He's a careless,
thoughtless, undisciplined fool.

485
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:08,680
Yes. I do like him very much.
It's very hard not to.

486
01:07:09,856 --> 01:07:12,950
Those magnificent Americans.

487
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:17,290
So much power and so little
understanding of what to do with it.

488
01:07:18,898 --> 01:07:21,662
What should I do?

489
01:07:23,603 --> 01:07:27,539
You must help him
save the Golden Child.

490
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:31,108
And follow your heart.

491
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:37,243
- Thank you, Gompa.
- You're welcome, Daughter.

492
01:07:38,918 --> 01:07:43,355
And when you want to marry him,
you have my blessing.

493
01:07:44,357 --> 01:07:46,484
Thank you, Father.

494
01:07:55,435 --> 01:07:57,733
They won't let me on the plane
with the knife.

495
01:07:57,904 --> 01:08:01,305
- Yes, they will.
- No, they won't. I'm going to jail.

496
01:08:04,277 --> 01:08:05,505
Thank you.

497
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:11,549
This won't work, and I'll spend the rest
of my life in a clay cell in Kathmandu.

498
01:08:11,718 --> 01:08:15,279
- Another cow?
- It's Kathmandu, what do you expect?

499
01:08:15,455 --> 01:08:20,916
There's no way they'll let me
on the plane with a knife under my shirt.

500
01:08:21,094 --> 01:08:23,619
Relax and trust in your destiny.

501
01:08:23,797 --> 01:08:26,129
- Come on.
- You trust in <i>your</i> destiny.

502
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:29,665
- Come with me.
- I have nothing to declare.

503
01:08:29,836 --> 01:08:32,896
- But necessary.
- Why? I can show you my bag here.

504
01:08:33,073 --> 01:08:35,906
- For your own protection.
- These are just my drawers.

505
01:08:36,076 --> 01:08:38,340
These are clean
and those are dirty.

506
01:08:38,511 --> 01:08:42,379
Excuse me, I have a plane to catch.
Come on, hurry up.

507
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:44,676
- What's this?
- Nothing.

508
01:08:44,851 --> 01:08:50,687
Just once I want to go back to America.
I'm a citizen. What are you looking at?

509
01:08:50,857 --> 01:08:55,556
It just does my heart good
to see another American citizen.

510
01:08:59,065 --> 01:09:00,999
- Hold it!
- Are you crazy?

511
01:09:01,167 --> 01:09:07,538
No, I'm Agent Jarrell from the American
Stolen Artefacts Foundation.

512
01:09:07,707 --> 01:09:11,734
Everybody, it's OK! I'm with
the Stolen Artefacts Foundation!

513
01:09:11,911 --> 01:09:14,903
Freddie, get out of my sight!
You make me sick!

514
01:09:15,081 --> 01:09:18,016
I'll talk to you on the plane.
Nobody be alarmed!

515
01:09:18,184 --> 01:09:21,881
I'm Chandler Jarrell,
American Stolen Artefacts Foundation.

516
01:09:22,055 --> 01:09:25,786
Thanks to you, we were able
to catch this man, Freddie,

517
01:09:25,959 --> 01:09:28,154
the piece of shit back there.

518
01:09:28,328 --> 01:09:31,195
I thank the good people of Nepal.

519
01:09:31,364 --> 01:09:33,855
You're all brilliant. Thank you, sir.

520
01:09:34,033 --> 01:09:40,734
You are one hell of a leader.
The cunningness... the instinct...

521
01:09:40,907 --> 01:09:44,308
The instinct is brilliant. I can tell
that you trained under this man.

522
01:09:44,477 --> 01:09:46,877
You have the same glare of brilliance
in your eye.

523
01:09:47,046 --> 01:09:49,947
You didn't know what you did,
but you're brilliant.

524
01:09:50,116 --> 01:09:53,711
The best brilliance is born
from someone ignorant...

525
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:58,452
Forget it.
This is my assistant, Kee Nang.

526
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:03,289
We thank you all.
People of Nepal, we thank you!

527
01:10:03,463 --> 01:10:06,523
You're a bunch of
beautiful, brilliant people.

528
01:10:06,699 --> 01:10:09,429
Nepal! N-E-P-A-L!

529
01:10:09,602 --> 01:10:11,797
Viva Nepal! Viva Nepal!

530
01:10:24,417 --> 01:10:25,907
No, thanks.

531
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:07,889
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

532
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:10,495
Hey. This is your problem, now.

533
01:11:10,663 --> 01:11:13,564
Thank you. You did a marvellous job
in obtaining the knife.

534
01:11:16,336 --> 01:11:20,636
You will be spending the next few days
at the house of a certain friend.

535
01:11:20,807 --> 01:11:23,367
When will we be contacted
about the knife?

536
01:11:27,847 --> 01:11:32,682
That's him. If he doesn't return
my property, I want him arrested.

537
01:11:38,124 --> 01:11:41,855
Welcome home, Mr Jarrell.
You have something for me.

538
01:11:48,201 --> 01:11:51,659
I'm sorry, Numsy.
I should be punished!

539
01:11:51,838 --> 01:11:55,001
Everyone, I have stolen
from my brother, Numsy.

540
01:11:55,174 --> 01:11:58,337
Officer, it's your duty to take me in.
Please, purge me.

541
01:11:58,511 --> 01:12:01,674
I'm ashamed of myself.
I should be arrested.

542
01:12:01,848 --> 01:12:04,681
I should be purged,
I should be flogged.

543
01:12:04,851 --> 01:12:07,752
- I shouldn't walk among good people.
- Let me talk to him.

544
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:11,880
I'm a swine, a wretch.
I don't deserve to live like others.

545
01:12:12,058 --> 01:12:15,027
How long do you think
you can keep up this masquerade?

546
01:12:15,194 --> 01:12:19,392
Until I get arrested, or you realise
the rules of evidence in this country.

547
01:12:19,565 --> 01:12:23,558
If I get arrested, they'll take me
and put me in a jail cell.

548
01:12:23,736 --> 01:12:29,641
They'll take the knife, because it's stolen,
and put an "Exhibit A" sticker on it.

549
01:12:29,809 --> 01:12:34,109
The knife sits in a room
and I sit in my little room

550
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:37,716
until the trial comes up
a month to a year later.

551
01:12:37,884 --> 01:12:41,980
If you get me arrested, there's no telling
when you'll get your knife.

552
01:12:46,759 --> 01:12:49,091
You have no idea who I am, have you?

553
01:12:49,262 --> 01:12:53,426
Yes! You're Sardo Numsy!

554
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,960
I don't care who you are. I do care
that you kidnapped a kid, though.

555
01:12:59,138 --> 01:13:01,971
I could destroy you just like that.

556
01:13:03,343 --> 01:13:06,608
We wouldn't want that. Listen...

557
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:09,407
Bring me the boy
and I'll give you the knife.

558
01:13:09,582 --> 01:13:12,449
Then no one will have
to be destroyed "just like that".

559
01:13:13,453 --> 01:13:15,478
Think it over.

560
01:13:15,655 --> 01:13:17,555
My brother's forgiven me!

561
01:13:17,724 --> 01:13:21,660
Kee, Dr Hong,
Brother Numsy has forgiven me.

562
01:13:22,495 --> 01:13:26,761
Dear brother!
Thank you, you're wonderful!

563
01:13:26,933 --> 01:13:30,266
- What else did you tell him?
- That I wouldn't be as polite next time.

564
01:13:31,471 --> 01:13:34,804
- You are foolhardy, aren't you?
- Well, I do my best.

565
01:14:27,026 --> 01:14:29,893
Are you coming to bed?

566
01:14:32,331 --> 01:14:34,925
No, I think I'm going to sleep out here.

567
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:39,397
Oh...

568
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,405
Good night.

569
01:15:35,495 --> 01:15:38,396
I just heard something.

570
01:15:39,332 --> 01:15:42,028
I don't like this. Let's get out of here.

571
01:16:35,621 --> 01:16:37,213
Run!

572
01:17:30,676 --> 01:17:34,544
I did not spend the night with you
to obligate you.

573
01:17:34,714 --> 01:17:38,878
I spent the night with you
because I love you.

574
01:17:51,197 --> 01:17:55,065
- She is beyond this world of pain.
- You can save her.

575
01:17:56,502 --> 01:17:58,834
The Golden Child can bring her back.

576
01:17:59,005 --> 01:18:01,667
As long as sunlight
still shines on her body...

577
01:18:01,841 --> 01:18:04,742
No more magic and riddles.
She's dead!

578
01:18:11,117 --> 01:18:14,245
You are the Chosen One.
You <i>will</i> find the child.

579
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:17,787
You have until nightfall to find him.
Sardo can't kill him until dark.

580
01:22:08,854 --> 01:22:11,152
We'll get you out of here, OK?

581
01:22:24,036 --> 01:22:26,004
Where's your boss?

582
01:22:26,171 --> 01:22:28,867
Keep an eye on the kid.
Don't worry, I'm the Chosen One.

583
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:30,372
This won't take long.

584
01:22:34,313 --> 01:22:36,474
My dear, sweet brother Numsy!

585
01:22:45,558 --> 01:22:49,619
I can see that you're busy right now.
I'll come back some other time.

586
01:23:03,776 --> 01:23:05,869
There are no keys in the car!

587
01:23:07,012 --> 01:23:09,674
Come on, come on!

588
01:23:14,253 --> 01:23:16,721
- Everything's going to be OK.
- I know.

589
01:23:16,889 --> 01:23:19,221
Fasten your seatbelt, kid.

590
01:23:33,005 --> 01:23:36,099
Did somebody give you a Valium,
or what?

591
01:23:40,446 --> 01:23:44,314
This must happen a lot where
you're from. I'm gonna shit on myself!

592
01:24:10,776 --> 01:24:12,300
Hey, Goldie!

593
01:24:14,013 --> 01:24:18,006
You ain't going to help me with
the chain, just keep running, right?

594
01:24:24,456 --> 01:24:26,083
Hey, wait!

595
01:28:42,981 --> 01:28:45,313
- How long are you going to be?
- Two weeks.

596
01:28:45,484 --> 01:28:48,612
- You drop the kid off and come back.
- Yes!

597
01:28:48,787 --> 01:28:50,254
Good!

598
01:28:50,422 --> 01:28:53,414
Listen, I bought this for you.

599
01:28:53,592 --> 01:28:58,359
You put that on and no one will mess
with your head while you're here.

600
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:00,395
Good? Good.

601
01:29:00,565 --> 01:29:03,625
You don't want to go to Tibet
with a big... on your head.

602
01:29:06,271 --> 01:29:09,832
That is a cool trick. Did you ever
think about going into show business?

603
01:29:10,008 --> 01:29:12,442
I could be your partner,
I'd throw a rock at you,

604
01:29:12,611 --> 01:29:16,672
and you'd make it float off
and hit the wall. Standing ovations.

605
01:29:16,848 --> 01:29:21,683
Do they have
Ed MacMahon's <i>Starsearch</i> in Tibet?

606
01:29:21,853 --> 01:29:24,287
Probably not.
They probably have <i>Foodsearch.</i>

607
01:29:24,456 --> 01:29:29,860
We could go on <i>Starsearch</i> and
let the audience throw rocks at you.

608
01:29:30,028 --> 01:29:34,692
You could move your hand
and make them hit MacMahon... hard.

609
01:33:13,685 --> 01:33:14,913
ENGLISH
