00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,870
What do you make of it?

3
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,835
lt appears to be a probe, Captain,
from an intelligence unknown to us.

4
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,337
Continue transmitting
"Universal Peace" and "Hello"

5
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:37,300
in all known languages.
Get me Starfleet Command.

6
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,677
Ready, Captain.

7
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,179
Starfleet Command,
this is U.S.S. Saratoga

8
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,390
patrolling Sector 5, Neutral Zone.

9
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,559
We're tracking a probe
of unknown origin

10
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,520
on apparent trajectory
to the Terran solar system.

11
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,898
Attempts to communicate
with the probe have been negative

12
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,900
on all known frequencies.

13
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,862
<i>Continue tracking, Saratoga. We will</i>
<i>analyse transmissions and advise.</i>

14
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,364
Roger, Starfleet. Saratoga out.

15
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:21,844
<i>6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 .</i>

16
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,660
There. Hold the image.

17
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,954
Hold!

18
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,083
Behold the quintessential
devil in these matters,

19
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,127
James T. Kirk, renegade and terrorist.

20
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,506
Not only is he responsible
for the murder of a Klingon crew,

21
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,636
the theft of a Klingon vessel,
see now the real plot and intentions.

22
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,139
Even as this Federation was
negotiating a peace treaty with us,

23
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,559
Kirk was secretly developing
the Genesis Torpedo,

24
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,395
conceived by Kirk's son,

25
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,272
and test-detonated
by the Admiral himself.

26
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,650
The result of this awesome energy

27
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,820
was euphemistically
called the Genesis Planet,

28
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:26,492
a secret base from which to launch
the annihilation of the Klingon people.

29
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:30,955
We demand the extradition of Kirk.
We demand justice!

30
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,834
Klingon justice is a unique point of view,
Mr President.

31
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:46,762
Genesis was perfectly named,
the creation of life, not death.

32
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:53,519
The Klingons shed the first blood
while attempting to possess its secrets.

33
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,895
Vulcans are well known

34
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,107
as the intellectual puppets
of this Federation.

35
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:04,238
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom.
Your men did kill Kirk's son.

36
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:08,492
-Do you deny these events?
-We deny nothing.

37
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:13,539
-We have the right to preserve our race.
-You have the right to commit murder?

38
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,167
Silence. Silence!

39
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,713
There'll be no further outbursts
from the floor.

40
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,800
Mr President, l have come
to speak on behalf of the accused.

41
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,679
Personal bias.
His son was saved by Kirk.

42
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:34,894
Mr Ambassador, with all respect,
the council's deliberations are over.

43
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,647
-Then Kirk goes unpunished?
-Admiral Kirk

44
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,943
has been charged with
nine violations of Starfleet regulations.

45
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,780
Starfleet regulations?
That's outrageous!

46
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,783
Remember this well.

47
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,870
There shall be no peace
as long as Kirk lives.

48
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,791
You pompous ass!

49
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,763
<i>Captain's log, Stardate 8390.</i>

51
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,268

<i>fine sense of historical irony,</i>

52
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,563

<i>And like those mutineers</i>

54
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,112
<i>we, too, have a hard choice to make.</i>

55
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,947
-Dr McCoy?
-Aye, sir.

56
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,698
-Mr Scott?
-Aye, sir.

00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,538
-Sulu?
-Aye, sir.

60
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,543
Let the record show
that the commander and the crew

61
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,044
of the late Starship Enterprise

62
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,964
have voted unanimously
to return to Earth,

63
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,216
to face
the consequences of their actions

64
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,219
in the rescue of their comrade
Captain Spock.

65
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,224
Thank you all. Repair stations, please.

66
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,562
-Mr Scott.
-Aye, sir?

67
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,648
-How soon can we be underway?
-Give me one more day, sir.

68
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,527
Damage control is easy.
Reading Klingon, that's hard.

69
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,906
You'd think they could
at least send a ship.

70
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,117
lt's bad enough to be court-martialed,

71
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,286
and spend the rest of our lives
mining borite,

72
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,622
but to have to go home
in this Klingon flea trap...

73
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,124
We could learn a thing or two
from this flea trap.

74
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,251
lt's got a cloaking device
that cost us a lot.

75
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,670
l just wish we could cloak the stench.

76
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,068

You're half human.

The question is irrelevant.

107
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:08,607
Spock, the retraining of your mind
has been in the Vulcan way,

108
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:14,321
so you may not understand feelings,
but as my son, you have them.

109
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,864
They will surface.

110
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,618

00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:26,792
-Why? Where must you go?
-l must go to Earth to offer testimony.

113

You do this for friendship.

114
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,881
l do it because l was there.

115
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:38,971
Spock, does the good of the many
outweigh the good of the one?

116
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,890
l would accept that as an axiom.

117

human friends.

119

00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,372
Saavik.

169
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,627
-This is goodbye.
-Yes, Admiral.

170
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,129
Thank you.

171
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:47,386
Sir, l have not had the opportunity
to tell you about your son.

172
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,056
David died most bravely.

173
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:57,312
He saved Spock. He saved us all.
l thought you should know.

174
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,991
Good day, Captain Spock.
May yourjourney be free of incident.

175
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,119
Live long and prosper, Lieutenant.

176
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,792
-Permission to come aboard.
-Permission granted.

177
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,460
-Thank you, Admiral.
-Jim.

178
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,631
Spock, Jim. Don't you remember?

179
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,550
lt would not be proper
to refer to you as Jim

180
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,885
while you're in command, Admiral.

181
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:34,850
Also, l must apologise for my attire.
l seem to have misplaced my uniform.

182
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,645
Station.

183
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,987
-Are you sure this is such a bright idea?
-What do you mean?

184
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,532
l mean him back at his post
like nothing happened.

185
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,284
l don't know if you've
got the whole picture or not,

186
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,746
but he's not exactly
working on all thrusters.

187
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,207
-lt'll come back to him.
-Are you sure?

188
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,340
That's what l thought.

189
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,805
Mr Sulu, take us home.

190
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,727
Thrusters functional.

191
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,570
One-quarter impulse power.

192
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,807
<i>Spacedock, this is Starfleet.</i>
<i>Launch all vessels. Launch all vessels.</i>

193
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,351
Sir, spacedock doors are inoperative.

194
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,478
All emergency systems
are nonfunctional.

195
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,355
-Engage reserve power.
-Aye, sir.

196
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,983
Starfleet Command, this is spacedock
on emergency channel.

197
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,069
We have lost all internal power.

198
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,876
Estimating planet Earth,
1 .6 hours, present speed.

199
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,502
Continue on course.

200
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,629
Mr Chekov, any sign
of a Federation escort?

201
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:13,091
No, sir, and no Federation
vessels on assigned patrol stations.

202
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,178
That's odd.

203
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,973
-Uhura, what's on the comm channels?
-Very active, sir.

204
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:24,853
Multiphasic transmissions, overlapping.
lt's almost a gibberish.

205
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,439
Let me see if l can sort it out.

206
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,027
Hi. Busy?

207
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,155
Uhura is busy. l am monitoring.

208
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,867
Well, l just wanted to say it sure is nice

209
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,953
to have your katra back in your head
and not mine.

210
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,332
What l mean is,
l may have carried your soul,

211
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,835
but l sure couldn't fill your shoes.

212
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,212
My shoes?

213
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,715
Forget it.

214
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,722
Perhaps we could
cover a little philosophical ground,

215
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:05,018
life, death, life, things of that nature.

216
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,146
l did not have time, on Vulcan,
to review the philosophical disciplines.

217
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,025
Come on, Spock. lt's me, McCoy.

218
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,237
You really have gone
where no man's gone before.

219
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,489
Can't you tell me what it felt like?

220
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,407
lt would be impossible
to discuss this subject

221
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,660
without a common frame of reference.

222
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,954
You're joking.

223
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,166
A joke
is a story with a humorous climax.

224
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:32,170
You mean l have to die
to discuss your insights on death?

225
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,423
Forgive me, Doctor.
l'm receiving a number of distress calls.

226
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,218
l don't doubt it.

227
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,292
Juneau, Alaska, clouds increase 95%.

228
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,840
Tokyo, total cloud coverage.
All power from reserve banks.

229
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,634
Leningrad has lost all electrical power.

230
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:24,347
Cloud coverage 1 00%.
Temperatures decreasing rapidly.

231
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,309
What is the estimate cloud cover
of the planet, at this time?

232
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,020
-78.6%.
-Notify all stations.

233
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,188
Starfleet emergency. Red Alert.

234
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,232
Switch power immediately
to planetary reserves.

235
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,567
Switching now, Admiral.

236
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,486
<i>Red Alert. We are now on Red Alert.</i>

237
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,323
<i>Attention. Attention. Red Alert.</i>

238
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,241
Mr President,

239
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:46,912
even with planetary reserves,
we cannot survive without the sun.

240
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,289
l'm well aware of that, Admiral.

241
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,920
Ambassador Sarek,

242
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,505
l'm afraid you're trapped here with us.

243
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,384
There seems to be no way
we can answer this probe.

244
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,094
lt is difficult to answer

245
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,972
when one
does not understand the question.

246
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,186
Mr President.

247
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,690
Perhaps you should transmit
a planetary distress signal,

248
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,817
while we still have time.

249
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,745
-Admiral.
-What is it?

250
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,246
Overlapping distress calls

251
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,750
and now a message
coming in from the Federation.

252
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,168
On screen.

253
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,968
<i>This is the President</i>
<i>of the United Federation of Planets.</i>

254
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,553
<i>Do not approach Earth.</i>

255
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,306
<i>The transmissions of an orbiting probe</i>

256
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,685
<i>are causing critical damage</i>
<i>to this planet.</i>

257
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,188
<i>It has almost totally</i>
<i>ionised our atmosphere.</i>

258
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,316
<i>All power sources have failed.</i>

259
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,903
<i>All Earth-orbiting starships</i>
<i>are powerless.</i>

260
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,864
<i>The probe is vapourising our oceans.</i>

261
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,534
<i>We cannot survive</i>
<i>unless a way can be found</i>

262
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,203
<i>to respond to the probe.</i>

263
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,123
<i>Further communications</i>
<i>may not be possible.</i>

264
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:21,589
<i>Save your energy. Save yourselves.</i>
<i>Avoid the planet Earth at all costs.</i>

265
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,676
<i>Farewell.</i>

266
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,535
Can you let us hear
the probe's transmission?

267
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,164
Yes, sir. On speakers.

268
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,056
-Spock, what do you make of that?
-Most unusual.

269
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,143
An unknown form of energy
of great power and intelligence,

270
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,897
evidently unaware
that its transmissions are destructive.

271
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,317
l find it illogical
that its intentions should be hostile.

272
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,403
Really? You think this
is its way of saying,

273
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,739
"Hi there" to the people of the Earth?

274
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,076
There are other forms of intelligence
on Earth, Doctor.

275
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,580
Only human arrogance would assume
the message must be meant for man.

276
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,834
You're suggesting the transmission
is meant for a life form other than man?

277
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,879
At least a possibility, Admiral.

278
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,965
The President did say
it was directed at Earth's oceans.

279
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,269
Uhura, can you modify
the probe signals,

280
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:02,273
accounting for density
and temperature and salinity factors?

281
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,858
l can try, sir.

282
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,050
l think l have it, sir.

283
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,389
And this is what it would
sound like underwater?

284
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,765
Yes, sir.

285
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,231
Fascinating.

286
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,984
lf my suspicion is correct,

287
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,404
there can be no response
to this message. Excuse me.

288
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,282
-Where are you going?
-To test my theory.

289
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,825
Bones, you stay here.

290
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,078
No way.
Somebody's got to keep an eye on him.

291
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,848
-Spock?
-As suspected.

292
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,643
The probe's transmissions
are the songs sung by whales.

293
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:26,274
-Whales.
-Specifically, humpback whales.

294
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,694
That's crazy. Who would
send a probe hundreds of light-years

295
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,864
-to talk to whales?
-lt's possible.

296
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,033
Whales have been on Earth
far earlier than man.

297
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:39,162
1 0 million years earlier. Humpbacks
were heavily hunted by man.

298
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,123
They've been extinct
since the 21 st century.

299
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,542
lt is possible that an alien intelligence

300
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,462
sent the probe to determine
why they lost contact.

301
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,340
-My God.
-Spock.

302
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,886
Could the humpbacks' answer
to this call be simulated?

303
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,890
The sounds, but not the language.
We would be responding in gibberish.

304
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,934
Does the species exist
on any other planet?

305
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:05,021
Negative. Humpbacks were indigenous
to Earth, Earth of the past.

306
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,692
Well, we have no choice.

307
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:12,737
We must destroy the probe
before it destroys Earth.

308
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,156
To attempt to do so
would be futile, Admiral.

309
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,991
The probe
could render us neutral easily.

310
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,035
We can't just turn away.

311
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,163
-There must be an alternative.
-There is one possibility,

312
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,249
but, of course,
l cannot guarantee success.

313
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,502
We could attempt
to find some humpback whales.

314
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,755
You just said there aren't any,
except on Earth of the past.

315
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:37,136
-Yes, Doctor, that is exactly what l said.
-Well, in that case...

316
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:40,223
-Now wait just a damn minute.
-Spock.

317
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:45,895
Start your computations for time warp.
Bones, you come with me.

318
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,447
<i>Red Alert. Red Alert.</i>

319
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:58,992
<i>-Red Alert.</i>
-Admiral.

320
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,118
We need that power

321
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,620
to keep the medical and
emergency facilities functioning.

322
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,163
All underground storage systems

323
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,417
have been shut down due to
contamination from the probe's wave.

324
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:11,462
<i>Red Alert. Red Alert.</i>

325
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,048
Hey, Tom, get those
steel plates in here!

326
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,480
<i>Red Alert. Red Alert.</i>

327
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,735
-Scotty, how long is this bay?
-About 60 feet, Admiral.

328
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,404
Can you enclose it to hold water?

329
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,990
l suppose l could.
You planning to take a swim?

330
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,700
Off the deep end, Mr Scott.

331
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,662
-We've got to find some humpbacks.
-Humpbacked people?

332
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,372
Whales, Mr Scott. Whales.

333
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,625
About 45 to 50 feet long.
About 40 tons each.

334
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,837
You really gonna try time travel
in this rust bucket?

335
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,340
-We've done it before.
-Sure. Slingshot around the sun,

336
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,091
pick up enough speed
and you're in time warp.

337
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,427
-lf you don't, you're fried.
-You prefer to do nothing?

338
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,471
l prefer a dose of common sense.

339
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,724
You're proposing
that we go backwards in time,

340
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,978
find humpback whales, then bring them
forward in time, drop them off,

341
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,773
and hope to hell they tell
this probe what to go do with itself.

342
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,608
-That's the general idea.
-Well, that's crazy.

343
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,109
You have a better idea? Now's the time.

344
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,073
-Your computations, Mr Spock?
-ln progress, Admiral.

345
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,283
Uhura, get me through
to Starfleet Command.

346
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,628
<i>-Red Alert.</i>
-l'm picking up a faint transmission.

347
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,381
<i>-Red Alert.</i>
-l think it's Admiral Kirk calling.

348
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,799
On screen.

349
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,554
<i>Starfleet Command,</i>
<i>this is AdmiraI James T. Kirk,</i>

350
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,808
<i>on route to Earth</i>
<i>aboard a Klingon vessel.</i>

351
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:51,396
<i>We have intercepted and analysed</i>
<i>the call of the probe threatening Earth.</i>

352
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,773
Satellite reserve power. Now.

353
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,985
<i>Only the extinct species,</i>
<i>humpback whale,</i>

354
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,280
<i>can give a proper response</i>
<i>to the probe.</i>

355
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,950
Stabilise. Emergency reserve.

356
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,952
<i>-Starfleet Command, do you read me?</i>
-Go ahead.

357
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,329
-We hear you.
<i>-Starfleet Command...</i>

358
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:13,167
<i>If you read me,</i>
<i>we're going to attempt time travel.</i>

359
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:18,047
<i>We are computing our trajectory</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

360
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,008
Get him back! Get him back!

361
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,609
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.

362
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,571
-What's our target in time?
-Late 20th century.

363
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,782
-Can you be more specific?
-Not with this equipment.

364
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,285
l've had to programme some
of the variables from memory.

365
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,413
-What are some of the variables?
-Availability of fuel components,

366
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,415
mass of the vessel
through a time continuum,

367
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,375
and probable location
of humpback whales,

368
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,919
in this case, the Pacific Basin.

369
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,297
You've programmed all that
from memory?

370
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,590
l have.

371
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,342
"Angels and ministers of grace
defend us!"

372
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,344
Hamlet, Act l, Scene lV.

373
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,889
No doubt about your memory, Spock.

374
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,601
Engage computers.
Prepare for warp speed.

375
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:17,273
-Shields, Mr Chekov.
-Shields, aye.

376
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,443
May fortune favour the foolish.

377
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,071
Warp speed, Mr Sulu.

378
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,206
Warp 2.

379
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:39,045
-Warp 3.
-Steady as she goes.

380
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:40,922
Warp 4.

381
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:47,929
Warp 5.

382
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,434
Warp 6.

383
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,978
Warp 7.

384
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,814
Warp 8!

385
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,109
Sir, heat shields at maximum.

386
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,612
Warp 9!

387
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,325
9.2. 9.3.

388
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:16,082
-We need breakaway speed.
-9.5. 9.6.

389
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,085
9.7. 9.8.

390
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,465
-l'm okay. l'm all right.
-Steady.

391
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,304
Now, Mr Sulu!

392
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,586
<i>-I should never have left...</i>
<i>-I had no controI, sir.</i>

393
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,671
<i>The mains are down, sir. Aux power...</i>

394
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,674
<i>-My God, Jim, where are we?</i>
<i>-It is the human thing to do.</i>

395
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,177
<i>Our mission? Spock, you're talking</i>
<i>about the end of every life on Earth.</i>

396
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:11,447
Mr Sulu.

397
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,164
Aye, sir.

398
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,085
What is our condition?

399
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,047
Sir, the braking thrusters have fired.

400
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,133
Picture, please.

401
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,431
Earth.

402
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,102
But when? Spock?

403
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,688
Judging by the pollution content
of the atmosphere,

404
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:47,024
l believe we have arrived
at the latter half of the 20th century.

405
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,444
-Well done, Spock.
-Admiral, if l may,

406
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:54,115
we are probably already visible
to the tracking devices of the time.

407
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,034
Quite right, Mr Spock.
Engage cloaking device, Mr Chekov.

408
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:07,044
We are crossing the terminator
into night.

409
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,672
Homing in
on the West Coast of North America.

410
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,467
Admiral, l am receiving whale song.

411
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,970
Put them on speakers.

412
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:28,858
Admiral, this is strange.
The song is directly ahead.

413
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,152
lt's coming from San Francisco.

414
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,905
From the city?

415
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,325
-That doesn't make sense.
<i>-Admiral.</i>

416
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,620
We have a serious problem.
Would you please come down?

417
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:50,379
lt's these Klingon crystals, Admiral.
The time travel drained them.

418
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,967
-They're giving out, decrystallising.
-Give me a round figure, Mr Scott.

419
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:58,095
24 hours, give or take, staying cloaked.

420
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,891
After that, Admiral, we're visible
and dead in the water.

421
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,184
ln any case,

422
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,561
we won't have enough
to break out of Earth's gravity,

423
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,188
to say nothing about getting home.

424
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,857
l can't believe we've come this far
only to be stopped by this.

425
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,067
ls there no way
of recrystallising the dilithium?

426
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,194
Sorry, sir.

427
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,113
We can't even do that
in the 23rd century.

428
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,334
Admiral, there may be
a 20th century possibility.

429
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,127
Explain.

430
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:32,588
lf memory serves,
there was a dubious flirtation

431
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:37,051
with nuclear fission reactors
resulting in toxic side effects.

432
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:41,138
By the beginning of the fusion era,
these reactors had been replaced,

433
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:44,391
but at this time
we may be able to find some.

434
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,520
But you said they were toxic.

435
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:51,816
We could construct a device to collect
their high-energy photons safely.

436
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,194
These photons could then be injected
into the dilithium chamber,

437
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,948
causing crystalline restructure,
theoretically.

438
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,826
Where would we find these
reactors, theoretically?

439
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,995
Nuclear power
was widely used in naval vessels.

440
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,964
San Francisco. l was born there.

441
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,883
lt doesn't look all that different.

442
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:23,264
-Set us down in Golden Gate Park.
-Aye, sir. Descending.

443
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,225
We'll divide into teams.

444
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,853
Commanders Uhura and Chekov
are assigned to the uranium problem.

445
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,355
-Yes, sir.
-Dr McCoy, you, Mr Scott,

446
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,859
and Commander Sulu
will convert us a whale tank...

447
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,777
Oh, joy.

448
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,904
...while Captain Spock and l

449
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,532
attempt to trace these
whale songs to their source.

450
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,826
l'll have bearing and distance
for you, sir.

451
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,872
l want you all to be very careful.
This is terra incognita.

452
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:51,125
Many of their customs
will doubtless take us by surprise.

453
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,632
lt's a foregone conclusion

454
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,927
none of these people have ever
seen an extraterrestrial before.

455
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,960
This is an extremely
primitive and paranoid culture.

456
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,921
Chekov will issue a phaser
and a communicator

457
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,255
to each team.

458
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,258
We'll maintain radio silence
except in emergencies.

459
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,928
Those of you in uniform,
remove your rank insignia.

460
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,305
Any questions? All right.

461
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,433
Let's do ourjob and get out of here.

462
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,645
Our own world is waiting
for us to save it. lf we can.

463
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:57,358
-Commence landing procedures.
-Aye, sir.

464
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,159
Don't tell me
you two are fighting again?

465
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,703
l thought you made up last night.

466
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:13,165
-Why are you two always fighting?
-l like the way she fights.

467
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,209
Anyway, l said to her,

468
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,420
"lf you think l'm gonna spend $60
for a damn toaster oven,

469
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:21,048
-"you're out of your mind."
-What did she say to that?

470
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,591
Well, she...

471
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,455
What the hell was that?

472
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,011
-Did you see that?
-No, and neither did you,

473
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,596
-so shut up.
-l didn't see nothing.

474
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:26,447
-Bearing to the whales?
-283 degrees, 1 5.2 kilometres.

475
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,116
Everybody remember where we parked.

476
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:53,015
Hey, why don't you watch
where you're going, you dumbass!

477
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,434
Well, double dumbass on you!

478
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,246
lt's a miracle these people
ever got out of the 20th century.

479
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,583
They're still using money,
we gotta find some.

480
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,127
Spock. The rest of you stay here.

481
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:29,968
The rest of you, break up.
You look like a cadet review.

482
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:59,498
Yes. 1 8th-century American.
Quite valuable.

483
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,084
Are you sure you want to part
with them?

484
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,711
-How much will you give me for them?
-Excuse me.

485
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,672
Weren't those a birthday present
from Dr McCoy?

486
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,842
And they will be again,
that's the beauty of it.

487
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,176
How much?

488
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:14,429
Well, they'd be worth more
if the lenses were intact.

489
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:17,015
l'll give you $1 00.

490
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,310
ls that a lot?

491
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,818
That's all there is, so don't splurge.

492
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,362
All set? Good hunting.

493
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,783
Well, Spock, here we are.

494
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:38,203
Thanks to your restored memory
and a little bit of good luck,

495
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,372
we're walking the
streets of San Francisco

496
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,041
looking for a couple
of humpback whales.

497
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,918
How do you propose to
solve this minor problem?

498
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,879
Simple logic will suffice.

499
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:50,632
l believe l shall begin
by making use of this map.

500
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:54,761
l have the distance and bearing which
were provided by Commander Uhura.

501
00:41:55,722 --> 00:42:00,559
lf we juxtapose our coordinates, we
should be able to find our destination

502
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,769
which lies at 283.7...

503
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:06,648
l think we'll find what we're looking for
at the Cetacean lnstitute in Sausalito.

504
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,234
A pair of humpback whales,
named George and Gracie.

505
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,112
-How do you know this?
-Simple logic.

506
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,500
What does it mean, exact change?

507
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:35,969
You mind telling me
how we plan to convert this tank?

508
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,890
Ordinarily, l could do it
with a piece of transparent aluminium.

509
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,351
l'm afraid you're a number of years
too early for that.

510
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:45,395
l know. We've got to find
the 20th-century equivalent.

511
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,813
But where?

512
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,743
-Did you find it?
-Yes. Under U.S. Government.

513
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,703
Now we need directions.

514
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:09,294
Excuse me, sir, can you direct me
to the naval base in Alameda?

515
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,173
lt's where they keep
the nuclear vessels.

516
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:19,179
Nuclear vessels.

517
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,269
-Excuse us.
-Excuse me,

518
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,854
we are looking for nuclear vessels.

519
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,399
Can you tell me
where the naval base is in...

520
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,734
We're looking for...

521
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,737
Hello. We are looking for
the nuclear vessels in Alameda.

522
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,864
-Could you tell me where...
-Can you help us?

523
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,117
We're looking for the
naval base in Alameda.

524
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,287
Could you tell me
where the nuclear vessels are?

525
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:47,958
l don't know if l know the answer to that.
l think it's across the bay, in Alameda.

526
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,376
That's what l said, Alameda.

527
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,044
-l know that.
-But where is Alameda?

528
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,054
Excuse me.

529
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:07,561
Excuse me.
Would you mind stopping that noise?

530
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,028
Excuse me.

531
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,363
Would you mind
stopping that damn noise?

532
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:41,511
Admiral, may l ask you a question?

533
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,431
Spock, don't call me Admiral.

534
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:49,102
You used to call me Jim.
Don't you remember? Jim?

535
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,105
What's your question?

536
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,983
Your use of language
has altered since our arrival.

537
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:59,696
lt is currently laced with, shall l say,
more colourful metaphors,

538
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,615
"double dumbass on you," and so forth.

539
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,949
-You mean the profanity?
-Yes.

540
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,243
That's simply the way they talk here.

541
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:09,289
Nobody pays any attention to you
unless you swear every other word.

542
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:11,875
You'll find it
in all the literature of the period.

543
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,543
For example?

544
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,296
Well, the collected works
of Jacqueline Susann,

545
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,673
the novels of Harold Robbins.

546
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:20,967
The giants.

547
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:34,189
<i>The next showing of</i>
The Wonderful World of Whales

548
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,233
<i>will begin in five minutes...</i>

549
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:43,323
Here l go.

550
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:49,371
Good morning.
l'm your guide this morning.

551
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,916
My name is Dr Gillian Taylor,
but you can call me Gillian.

552
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,253
l'm assistant director
of the Maritime Cetacean lnstitute.

553
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:59,840
So, please follow me, and just
give a yell if you can't hear me, okay?

554
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,760
The Cetacean lnstitute
is the only museum in the world

555
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:06,096
exclusively devoted to whales.

556
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,099
As you can see,
we have a great deal to offer,

557
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,309
but that is small
compared to what we know,

558
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:14,396
or rather,
what we don't know about whales.

559
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,442
The first commonly held misconception
is that whales are fish.

560
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,570
They're not. They're mammals,
just like you and me,

561
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,989
warm-blooded, needing air to breathe,

562
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:26,408
and producing milk
to nurse their young.

563
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,827
Do whales attack people
like in Moby Dick?

564
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:32,122
No. No, most whales
don't even have teeth.

565
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,957
They have a soft, gum-like tissue

566
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,085
that strains
vast amounts of tiny shrimp for food.

567
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,629
And that is the limit of their hostility.

568
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:44,134
Unfortunately, their principal enemy
is far, far more aggressive.

569
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,304
-You mean man.
-To put it mildly.

570
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,222
Since the dawn of time,

571
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:52,350
men have harvested whales
for a variety of purposes,

572
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,937
most of which can be
achieved synthetically at this point.

573
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:59,065
1 00 years ago,
using hand-thrown harpoons,

574
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,109
man did plenty of damage.

575
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,195
But that is nothing compared
to what he has achieved

576
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,779
in this century.

577
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:09,493
This is mankind's legacy,
whales hunted to the brink of extinction.

578
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:12,120
Virtually gone is the blue whale,

579
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:15,123
the largest creature
ever to inhabit the Earth.

580
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,459
Despite all attempts
at banning whaling,

581
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,462
there are still countries and pirates
currently engaged

582
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,507
in the slaughter of these
inoffensive creatures.

583
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,300
Where the humpback whale
once numbered

584
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,260
in the hundreds of thousands,

585
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,013
today there are less
than 1 0,000 specimens alive.

586
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,517
And those that are taken in
are no longer fully grown.

587
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,311
ln addition,
many of the female whales are killed

588
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,897
while still bearing unborn calves.

589
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:43,109
To hunt a species to extinction
is not logical.

590
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,946
Who ever said
the human race was logical?

591
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,157
Now, if you'll follow me, please,

592
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:52,244
l'll introduce you
to the lnstitute's pride and joy.

593
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,885
This is the largest seawater tank
in the world,

594
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,639
and it contains the only two
humpback whales in captivity.

595
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:23,984
They are mature humpbacks
weighing 45,000 pounds each.

596
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,739
They wandered into San Francisco Bay
as calves and were brought here.

597
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,367
We call them George and Gracie.

598
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,037
lt's perfect, Spock.

599
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,331
A male and a female humpback
in a contained space.

600
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,668
We beam them up together,
consider ourselves lucky.

601
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:51,761
Beautiful, aren't they?
And extremely intelligent.

602
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,180
Now if you'll follow me, please.

603
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,270
Despite all that they are teaching us,

604
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,940
we have to return George
and Gracie to the open sea.

605
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:06,234
-Why is that?
-Well, for one thing,

606
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,694
we simply don't have enough money

607
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,197
to keep feeding them
2 tons of shrimp per day.

608
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,659
-How soon?
-Soon.

609
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:18,496
lt's too bad, too, because they're really
quite friendly, as you could see.

610
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,041
l've grown quite attached to them.

611
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:29,549
And now, here's a much better way
to see George and Gracie. Underwater.

612
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,605
What you're hearing
is recorded whale song.

613
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,649
lt is sung by the male.

614
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:49,152
He'll sing anywhere
from 6 to as long as 30 minutes,

615
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,029
and then start again.

616
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:55,200
ln the ocean, the other whales
will pick up his song, and pass it on.

617
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,993
The songs change every year,

618
00:49:57,078 --> 00:50:00,288
and we still don't know
what purpose they serve.

619
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,210
Are they some kind
of navigational signal?

620
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,131
Could they be part of the mating ritual?

621
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:16,763
Or is it pure communication
beyond our comprehension?

622
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:23,311
-Frankly, we just don't know yet.
-Maybe he's singing to that man.

623
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:28,358
How'd he get in there?

624
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:32,278
What the hell?
Excuse me. Wait right here.

625
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,496
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

626
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:49,295
All right, who the hell are you?
What were you doing in there?

627
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,631
Yeah, speak up, fella.

628
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:52,966
Attempting the hell to communicate.

629
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,011
Communicate? Communicate what?
You have no right to be here!

630
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,389
You heard the lady.

631
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,517
Admiral, if we were to assume

632
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,894
that these whales
are ours to do with as we please,

633
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,814
we would be as guilty as those
who caused their extinction.

634
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:12,402
Okay, l don't know what this is all about,

635
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,238
but l want you guys out of here
right now, or l call the cops.

636
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,074
l assure you that won't be necessary.
We're only trying to help.

637
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:19,117
The hell you were, buster.

638
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,078
Your friend was messing up
my tanks and messing up my whales.

639
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:25,373
They like you very much, but
they are not the hell your whales.

640
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:29,419
-l suppose they told you that, huh?
-The hell they did.

641
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,337
Right.

642
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:37,594
-Spock.
-Yes.

643
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:40,805
About those colourful metaphors
that we've discussed.

644
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:44,476
l don't think
you should try using them any more.

645
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,311
-Why not?
-Well, for one thing,

646
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,521
you haven't quite got the knack of it.

647
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:49,606
-l see.
-And another thing.

648
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,026
lt's not always necessary
to tell the truth.

649
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,196
-l cannot tell a lie.
-l don't mean lie,

650
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,364
but you could exaggerate.

651
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,574
-Exaggerate?
-Exaggerate.

652
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,951
You've done it before.
Can't you remember?

653
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,703
The hell l can't.

654
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,248
What else did you learn
from your mind meld?

655
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:10,543
They're unhappy about the way their
species have been treated by man.

656
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,462
Well, they have a right to be.
Are they gonna help us?

657
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,590
l believe l was successful in
communicating our intentions.

658
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,883
l see.

659
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:27,268
lt's all right. Yes, l know.
lt's okay, they didn't mean any harm.

660
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:40,698
-Heard there was some excitement.
-Just a couple of kooks.

661
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,203
-How you doing?
-l'm fine.

662
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:49,249
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo.
l've known you too long.

663
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,044
Bob, it's tearing me apart, okay?

664
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,923
l know. l feel the same thing,

665
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,676
but we're stuck
between a rock and a hard place.

666
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,511
We can't keep them here
without risking their lives,

667
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,847
we can't let them go
without taking the same chance.

668
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,682
l know, l know.

669
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:09,352
And besides, we're not talking
about human beings here.

670
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,145
lt's never been proven their intelligence

671
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,981
-is in any way...
-Come on, Bob!

672
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,275
l don't know about you,
but my compassion for someone

673
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,986
is not limited
to my estimate of their intelligence.

674
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:40,174
Team leader, this is Team Two.
Come in, please.

675
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,093
l have the coordinates of the reactor.

676
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,053
<i>Team Two, Kirk here.</i>

677
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:47,223
Admiral, we have found
the nuclear vessel.

678
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:50,852
<i>-WeII done, Team Two.</i>
-And, Admiral,

679
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,270
it is the Enterprise.

680
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,651
Understood. What's your plan?

681
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,363
We will beam in tonight,
collect the photons, and beam out.

682
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:03,990
No one will ever know we were there.

683
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,993
Understood and approved.
Keep me informed.

684
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,620
<i>Kirk out.</i>

685
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,380
There she is. From the lnstitute.
lf we play our cards right,

686
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:21,591
we may be able to find out
when those whales are leaving.

687
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,093
How will playing cards help?

688
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:28,181
Well, if it isn't
Robin Hood and Friar Tuck.

689
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,059
Where are you fellas heading?

690
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:33,645
Back to San Francisco.

691
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:37,690
You came all the way down here just to
jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?

692
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,402
Very little point in my trying to explain.

693
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,780
Well, yeah, l'll buy that.
What about him?

694
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,823
Him? He's harmless.

695
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:49,953
Back in the '60s, he was part of the
Free Speech Movement at Berkeley.

696
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:54,499
-l think he did a little too much LDS.
-LDS?

697
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:58,252
Come on,
why don't you let me give you a lift?

698
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:00,296
l have a notorious weakness
for hard luck cases,

699
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:01,422
that's why l work with whales.

700
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:05,176
-We don't want to be any trouble.
-You've already been that. Come on.

701
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,733
-Well, thank you very much.
-Don't mention it.

702
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,110
And don't try anything, either.

703
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:25,071
l've got a tyre iron
right where l can get at it.

704
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:33,037
-So, you were at Berkeley?
-l was not.

705
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,166
-Memory problems, too.
-What about you?

706
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,918
-Where are you from?
-lowa.

707
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,962
A landlubber.

708
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:44,799
Come on. What the hell were you guys
really trying to do back there?

709
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,385
lt wasn't some kind of macho thing,
was it? Because if that's all,

710
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,638
l'll be real disappointed.
l really hate that macho stuff.

711
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:55,977
-May l ask you a question?
-Go ahead.

712
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:59,939
What's going to happen
when you release the whales?

713
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,028
They're going to have
to take their chances.

714
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,613
What does that mean, exactly,
take their chances?

715
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:10,450
lt means that they will be at risk
from whale hunters,

716
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:14,037
the same as the rest of the humpbacks.

717
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,747
What did you mean
when you said all that stuff,

718
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,957
back at the lnstitute, about extinction?

719
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:21,586
-l meant...
-He meant what you said on the tour,

720
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,504
that if things
keep going the way they are,

721
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:27,216
-the humpbacks will disappear forever.
-That's not what he said, farm boy.

722
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,551
"Admiral, if we were to assume

723
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,553
"those whales
are ours to do with as we please,

724
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,597
"we would be as guilty
as those who caused"

725
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,265
past tense "their extinction."

726
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,143
l have a photographic memory.
l see words.

727
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,731
Are you sure it isn't time
for a colourful metaphor?

728
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,902
You're not one of those guys
from the military, are you?

729
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,945
Trying to teach whales
to retrieve torpedoes

730
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:51,741
-or some dipshit stuff like that?
-No, ma'am. No dipshit.

731
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:55,703
Well, good. That's one thing,
l would have let you off right here.

732
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,623
Gracie is pregnant.

733
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:03,086
All right, who are you?
And don't jerk me around any more.

734
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,004
l wanna know how you know that.

735
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,339
-We can't tell you that...
-But...

736
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,716
But, if you let me finish,

737
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:10,927
l can tell you
that we're not in the military,

738
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,512
and we intend no harm
towards the whales.

739
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,555
-Then what...
-ln fact,

740
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:20,228
we may be able to help you in ways that,
frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.

741
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,523
-Or believe, l'll bet.
-Very likely.

742
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,609
You're not exactly
catching us at our best.

743
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,486
That much is certain.

744
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,283
l have a hunch

745
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:38,538
that we'd all be a lot happier
discussing this over dinner.

746
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,206
What do you say?

747
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,505
You guys like ltalian?

748
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,216
-No.
-Yes.

749
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,177
-No.
-Yes. l love ltalian.

750
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,223
-And so do you.
-Yes.

751
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:11,362
<i>Sam, you got a phone call on line one.</i>
<i>Sam, call on line one.</i>

752
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,409
Professor Scott,
l'm Dr Nichols, the plant manager.

753
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:21,414
l'm terribly sorry.
There's been an awful mix-up.

754
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:25,168
Would you believe
l was never told about your visit?

755
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,837
l've tried to clear things up,
Professor Scott.

756
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,215
l explained that you'd come
all the way here from Edinburgh,

757
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:35,303
on appointment, to study
methods of manufacturing by Plexicorp,

758
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,972
but they don't seem
to know anything about it.

759
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,683
Don't know anything about it?

760
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,395
l find it hard to believe
that l've come millions of miles...

761
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:48,858
-Thousands. Thousands.
-...thousands of miles on an invited tour

762
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,027
-of inspection...
-Professor Scott,

763
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,695
-if you'll just...
-l demand to see the owners.

764
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:56,032
-l demand...
-Professor Scott, just take it easy.

765
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:59,911
Dr Nichols has offered to take us
around the plant, personally.

766
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,829
-He has?
-Yes.

767
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:05,666
-With pleasure.
-Well, that's different.

768
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:08,544
Gregory!

769
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,506
Whoa! Professor.

770
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:17,011
-May my assistant join us?
-Of course.

771
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,681
Don't bury yourself in the part.

772
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,937
-Hi.
-Hi.

773
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:30,358
-Good-looking ship. Huey 204, isn't it?
-Right on.

774
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:33,569
-You fly?
-Here and there.

775
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:36,322
l flew something similar
back in my Academy days.

776
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,617
Right.
Then this must be old stuff to you.

777
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,745
Old, yes, but interesting.

778
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,664
Do you mind
if l ask you a few questions?

779
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:45,790
Do it.

780
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,715
Well, this is a fine place
you have here, Dr Nichols.

781
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,926
Thank you. l must say, Professor,

782
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,303
your knowledge of engineering
is most impressive.

783
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:01,722
Yes. Back home
we call him the miracle worker.

784
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:05,643
lndeed.
May l offer you something, gentlemen?

785
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:09,146
Dr Nichols, l might be able
to offer something to you.

786
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,273
Yes?

787
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,608
l noticed
you're still working with polymers.

788
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:14,735
Still?

789
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:19,240
-What else would l be working with?
-Aye, what else, indeed?

790
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,158
l'll put it another way.

791
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:24,578
How thick would a piece of
your Plexiglas need to be,

792
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,664
at 60' x 1 0',

793
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,750
to withstand the pressure of
1 8,000 cubic feet of water?

794
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:32,628
That's easy, 6".

795
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:36,048
-We carry stuff that big in stock.
-l noticed.

796
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:39,468
Now suppose, just suppose,

797
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:44,724
l were to show you
a way to manufacture a wall,

798
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:50,229
that would do the same job
but be only 1 " thick.

799
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,442
Would that be worth something to you?

800
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,193
You're joking.

801
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,779
Perhaps the professor
could use your computer.

802
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,072
Please.

803
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,367
Computer?

804
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,454
Computer.

805
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,420
Hello, computer.

806
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,089
Just use the keyboard.

807
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:22,428
The keyboard. How quaint.

808
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:56,128
-Transparent aluminium?
-That's the ticket, laddie.

809
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:02,885
lt would take years just to figure out
the dynamics of this matrix.

810
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:07,056
Yes, but you would be rich
beyond the dreams of avarice.

811
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:11,477
So, is it worth something to you?

812
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,313
-Or should l just punch up "clear"?
-No.

813
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,151
Not now, Madeline!

814
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:33,290
-What exactly did you have in mind?
-Well, a moment alone, please.

815
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:44,552
You realise, of course,
that if we give him the formula,

816
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,096
we're altering the future.

817
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,850
Why? How do we know
he didn't invent the thing?

818
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:09,785
Sure you won't change your mind?

819
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,830
ls there something wrong
with the one l have?

820
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,040
A little joke.

821
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:19,003
-Goodbye, old friend.
-Wait a minute.

822
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:22,465
How did you know Gracie's pregnant?
Nobody knows that.

823
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:26,302
Gracie does. l'll be right here.

824
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,850
What, he's just gonna hang around
the bushes while we eat?

825
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,393
lt's his way.

826
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:56,165
-Do you trust me?
-lmplicitly.

827
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:01,837
A large mushroom-pepperoni
with extra onions and Michelob, please.

828
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:06,884
-Great choice. And you, sir?
-Make that two of them.

829
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,302
Thank you.

830
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:17,311
Well, how did a nice girl like you
get to be a cetacean biologist?

831
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,231
Just lucky, l guess.

832
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:25,444
You're upset about losing the whales,
aren't you?

833
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:29,365
You're very perceptive.

834
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,411
How will that be done exactly?

835
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:39,291
They'll be flown in a special 747
to Alaska and released there.

836
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:42,378
Flown, and that's
the last you'll see of them?

837
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,004
See, yes.

838
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:46,382
But we'll tag them
with radio transmitters

839
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:49,718
on a special frequency
so that we can keep tabs on them.

840
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:58,310
You know,
l could take those whales somewhere

841
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,813
where they'd never be hunted.

842
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,239
You can't even get yourself
from Sausalito to San Francisco

843
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:11,824
without a lift.

844
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,119
lf you have such a low opinion
of my abilities,

845
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:17,580
how come we're here having dinner?

846
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:21,667
Sucker for hard luck cases. Cheers.

847
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:30,384
Besides, l want to know
why you travel around with that ditzy guy

848
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:33,929
who knows that Gracie's pregnant
and calls you Admiral?

849
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,437
Where could you take them?

850
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,772
My whales.

851
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,025
Where could you take them
where they'd be safe?

852
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:50,195
lt's not so much
a matter of a place as of a time.

853
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:54,033
-The time would have to be right now.
-Why right now?

854
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:58,245
Let's just say that no humpback
born in captivity has ever survived.

855
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,250
The problem is that
they won't be that much safer at sea

856
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:06,253
because of all the hunting
this time of year.

857
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,633
So you see, that, as they say, is that.

858
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:15,763
Damn.

859
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,814
-What is that?
-What's what?

860
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:27,983
You have a pocket pager.

861
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,195
Are you a doctor?

862
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:37,076
What is it?
l thought l told you never to call me.

863
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,745
<i>Sorry, Admiral.</i>
<i>We just thought you'd like to know,</i>

864
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,705
<i>we're beaming them in now.</i>

865
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:45,459
All right, tell them phasers on stun.
Good luck. Kirk out.

866
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:50,089
You want to try it from the top?

867
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,260
Why don't you tell me
when those whales are leaving?

868
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,348
-Who are you?
-Who do you think l am?

869
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:03,268
Don't tell me. You're from outer space.

870
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:06,730
No, l'm from lowa.
l only work in outer space.

871
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:08,691
Well, l was close.

872
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:12,194
l knew outer space was gonna
come into this sooner or later.

873
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:15,364
-The truth?
-l'm all ears.

874
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,542
Okay.

875
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,294
The truth.

876
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,137
l am from what, on your calendar,
would be the late 23rd century.

877
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:42,182
l've come back in time

878
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:47,938
to bring two humpback whales with me
in an attempt to

879
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,940
repopulate the species.

880
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:56,238
Well, why didn't you just say so?
l mean, why all the coy disguises?

881
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,117
You want the details?

882
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:03,162
l wouldn't miss this
for all the tea in China.

883
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:05,914
When are those whales being released?

884
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,418
Okay. What the hell?

885
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,919
Your friend was right.

886
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,672
Gracie's not only pregnant,
she's very pregnant.

887
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:17,384
And at noon tomorrow, in what is sure
to be a media circus,

888
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:22,264
-the whales get shipped out.
-Noon tomorrow?

889
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,811
-Are we leaving?
-Come on. We don't have much time.

890
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:31,398
-Could we have that to go, please?
-Sure. Who gets the bad news?

891
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:33,609
Don't tell me, they don't use money
in the 23rd century.

892
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:34,860
Well, we don't.

893
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:39,698
<i>Now hear this. Smoking lamp is out</i>
<i>while transferring fuel.</i>

894
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:30,499
How long?

895
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:34,253
Depends on how much shielding there
is between us and the reactor.

896
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:45,097
Well, Admiral,

897
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,100
that was the briefest dinner
l've ever had in my life,

898
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:51,562
and certainly the biggest cockamamie
fish story l've ever heard.

899
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:55,524
You asked. You tell me something.

900
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,861
George and Gracie's transmitter,
what's the radio frequency?

901
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,737
Sorry, that's classified.

902
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:04,032
Look, l don't have a clue
who you are, really.

903
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:09,204
You wouldn't want to show me
around your spaceship, would you?

904
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:13,542
-That wouldn't be my first choice, no.
-Well, there we are.

905
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,547
Let me tell you something.

906
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:22,676
l'm here to bring two humpbacks
into the 23rd century.

907
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,803
lf l have to, l'll go to the open sea
to get them.

908
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:27,514
l'd much rather have yours.

909
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:33,020
lt's better for me, better for you,
it's better for them.

910
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:35,814
Think about it.

911
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,406
Who are you?

912
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,826
Think about it, but don't take too long.
l'm out of time.

913
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:50,454
lf you change your mind,
this is where l'll be.

914
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:51,997
Here?

915
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:54,666
ln the park?

916
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:56,376
Right.

917
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,964
-Status?
-The tank will be finished by morning.

918
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,383
That's cutting it closer than you know.
What about Team Two?

919
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,135
No word since beam-in.
We can only wait for them to call.

920
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:51,473
Damn it. Damn it. We've been so lucky.

921
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,475
We got two perfect whales
right in our hands.

922
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,018
lf we don't move quickly,
we'll lose them.

923
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:58,563
ln that event, the probabilities are
that our mission would fail.

924
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,732
Our mission?

925
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:03,527
Spock, you're talking
about the end of every life on Earth.

926
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,112
You're half human.

927
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:08,323
Haven't you got any
goddamn feelings about that?

928
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:39,521
-There it is again.
-That's too weird.

929
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,690
Commander.

930
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,109
l thought you gents were
running a test programme.

931
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:47,029
Yes, sir, but we apparently
are getting a power drain.

932
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,740
lt must be coming from inside the ship.

933
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:55,579
ClC Command Duty Officer,
Commander Rogerson.

934
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:57,998
Yes, Chief, we're tracking that, too.
What do you make of it?

935
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,507
Scotty, we're ready for beam-out.

936
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,802
Scotty, can you hear me?

937
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:14,848
Confirmed. Roger that.

938
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:20,812
MarDet Commanding Officer,

939
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:23,273
this is the Command Duty Officer,
Commander Rogerson.

940
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:25,484
We have an intruder in number 4MMR.

941
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,195
l say again,
we have an intruder in number 4MMR.

942
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:31,782
Scotty, do you read?

943
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,367
<i>Scotty, come in, please.</i>

944
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:38,246
Lass, l can hardly hear you.

945
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,707
My transporter power
is down to minimal.

946
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,168
l've got to bring you in one at a time.

947
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:46,171
Take the collector. You go first.

948
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,304
Stand by.

949
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:04,773
Scotty.

950
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,567
Hello.

951
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,865
Come in, please.

952
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:18,370
Scotty, how soon?

953
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:23,500
Chekov, you're breaking up.
Please signal again.

954
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:27,254
Chekov, can you hear me?

955
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:31,091
Scotty, now would be a good time.

956
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:33,426
Freeze!

957
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,637
Chekov!

958
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:39,724
l've lost him.

959
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:45,647
"Commander Pavel Chekov. Starfleet.
United Federation of Planets."

960
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:52,779
All right, Commander.
ls there anything you want to tell us?

961
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:54,531
Like what?

962
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:57,200
Like who you really are,
and what you're doing here,

963
01:14:57,285 --> 01:14:59,327
and what these things here are.

964
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,205
l am Pavel Chekov,
a commander in Starfleet,

965
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:07,502
United Federation of Planets.
Service number 656-5827D.

966
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,590
All right. Let's take it from the top.

967
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:13,675
The top of what?

968
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,010
-Name.
-My name?

969
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,887
-No, my name!
-l do not know your name.

970
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,973
You play games with me, Mister,
and you're through.

971
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,934
l am? May l go now?

972
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,566
-What do you think?
-He's a russkie.

973
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:32,194
That is the stupidest thing
l've ever heard in my life.

974
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:35,363
Of course he's a russkie,
but he's a retard or something.

975
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,866
We better call Washington.

976
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,618
Don't move.

977
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:42,329
Okay, make nice. Give us the ray gun.

978
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:46,166
l warn you, if you don't lie on the floor,
l will have to stun you.

979
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:49,252
Go ahead. Stun me.

980
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:51,254
l'm very sorry, but...

981
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,221
Must be the radiation.

982
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:08,480
<i>Emergency. We have a security breach.</i>
<i>General alarm.</i>

983
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:19,908
Gangway!

984
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:34,005
Hit the deck!

985
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,058
Get out of the way. Hit the deck.

986
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:03,410
-Man down. Get a corpsman over here.
-Yes, sir.

987
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:09,582
-Any luck?
-Nothing.

988
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,877
-Admiral, l should never have left him.
-You did what was necessary.

989
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:14,963
Keep trying, you'll find him.

990
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:21,636
Scotty, you promised me
an estimate on the dilithium crystals.

991
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,640
lt's going slowly, sir.
lt'll be well into tomorrow.

992
01:17:26,017 --> 01:17:28,727
That's not good enough, Mr Scott.
You've got to do better.

993
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:31,062
l'll try, sir. Scott out.

994
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,982
Boy, he's in a wee bit of a snit, isn't he?

995
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:38,403
-He is a man of deep feelings.
-Aye. What else is new?

996
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,150
They left last night. We didn't want
a mob scene with the press.

997
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,735
lt wouldn't have been good for them.
Besides, we thought

998
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:20,862
-it would be easier on you, this way.
-You sent them away

999
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,197
without even
letting me say goodbye to them?

1000
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:24,824
-Gillian.
-You son of a bitch!

1001
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,349
Admiral!

1002
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:36,271
Admiral Kirk! Admiral Kirk!

1003
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:54,497
Admiral! Admiral Kirk!

1004
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:59,544
Wait! Admiral! Admiral Kirk!

1005
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,051
Admiral!

1006
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:13,683
Admiral! Admiral Kirk!
Can you hear me?

1007
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:19,230
They're gone! l need your help!
Are you in there?

1008
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:23,067
Admiral, we have a problem!

1009
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:33,620
<i>Admiral! Admiral Kirk!</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1010
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:39,417
<i>Admiral Kirk! Can you hear me?</i>
<i>I need your help!</i>

1011
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:41,920
Oh, my God!

1012
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:56,601
Hello, Alice. Welcome to Wonderland.

1013
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:59,395
-lt's true.
-lt's true.

1014
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,481
-What you said.
-Yes, it is.

1015
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:04,317
l'm glad you're here, but l must admit,
you picked a hell of a time to drop in.

1016
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:07,028
Take it easy. We need your help.

1017
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:11,449
-ls any of this real?
-Yes, it's real. Take a look.

1018
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,165
Storage tanks for your whales.
We'll bring them up

1019
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:22,001
-the same way we brought you up...
-Admiral, they're gone.

1020
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,379
-Gone?
-They were taken last night.

1021
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:27,799
l wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.

1022
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,468
Damn.

1023
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:34,138
But they're tagged, like l told you.
l mean, you can go find them, right?

1024
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:37,934
-We can't go anywhere.
-What kind of a spaceship is this?

1025
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:44,315
-lt's a spaceship with a missing man.
-Admiral, full power has been restored.

1026
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:48,987
-Thank you, Mr Spock.
-Hello, Doctor. Welcome aboard.

1027
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:52,323
<i>Admiral, are you there?</i>

1028
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:54,993
Yes, Uhura. What's wrong?

1029
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,161
l've located Chekov, sir.

1030
01:21:57,246 --> 01:22:00,123
They're taking him to
emergency surgery right now.

1031
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:02,875
-Where?
<i>-Mercy Hospital.</i>

1032
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:05,461
-Mercy Hospital.
-That's in the Mission District.

1033
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:07,505
<i>They report his condition as critical.</i>

1034
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,633
He's not expected to survive.

1035
01:22:13,012 --> 01:22:14,178
Jim.

1036
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,307
You've got to let me go in there.

1037
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:19,767
Don't leave him in the hands
of 20th century medicine.

1038
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:23,855
Admiral, may l suggest
that Dr McCoy is correct?

1039
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,566
We must help Chekov.

1040
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:31,446
ls that the logical thing to do, Spock?

1041
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,282
No, but it is the human thing to do.

1042
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:40,371
-Right. Will you help us?
-How?

1043
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:44,250
Well, we're going to have
to look like physicians.

1044
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:53,217
We'll try down here. You check there.

1045
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:05,647
-What's the matter with you?
-Kidney dialysis.

1046
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:06,981
Dialysis?

1047
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:11,110
My God. What is this, the Dark Ages?

1048
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:12,654
Here.

1049
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:15,114
Now, you swallow that,

1050
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,201
and if you have any
problems, just call me.

1051
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:22,997
Here, l got it.

1052
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:26,501
Let's go.

1053
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:35,009
He's being held in the security corridor,
one flight up. His condition is critical.

1054
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:36,344
Come on.

1055
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:39,764
Excuse me. We'll take that.

1056
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:48,523
Hold the door. Hold the door.
Emergency.

1057
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:50,358
-So, you were there, what happened?
-Yeah, l was there.

1058
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:53,152
l heard the whole thing.

1059
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:56,364
Weintraub says radical chemotherapy,
or she's gonna croak, just like that.

1060
01:23:56,448 --> 01:24:00,618
-Well, what about Gottlieb?
-All he talked about was image therapy.

1061
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:02,995
Thought they were going to
punch each other out.

1062
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,706
Unbelievable.

1063
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,541
You have a different view, Doctor?

1064
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,836
lt sounds like the goddamn
Spanish lnquisition to me.

1065
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:11,963
Bad day.

1066
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,761
-Out of the way.
-Sorry, Doctor. l have strict orders...

1067
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:22,223
Damn it, do you want
an acute case on your hands?

1068
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,349
This woman has immediate

1069
01:24:23,434 --> 01:24:25,810
postprandial
upper abdominal distention.

1070
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,604
Out of the way. Get out of the way.

1071
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:33,109
-What did you say she's got?
-Cramps.

1072
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:38,865
Who are you? Why aren't you masked?
Who are these people?

1073
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:40,408
l don't know.

1074
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:44,454
What the hell is that?
What are you doing?

1075
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:46,414
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery.

1076
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:48,833
What's your degree in, dentistry?

1077
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:52,253
How do you explain slowing pulse,
low respiratory rate, and coma?

1078
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:54,714
-Funduscopic examination.
-Funduscopic examination

1079
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:56,174
is unrevealing in these cases.

1080
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:59,051
A simple evacuation of the
expanding epidural haematoma

1081
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,929
-will relieve the pressure.
-My God, man.

1082
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:04,182
Drilling holes in his head
is not the answer.

1083
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:06,100
The artery must be repaired.

1084
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:08,770
Now put away your butcher knives
and let me save this patient

1085
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:12,148
-before it's too late.
-l'm going to have you removed.

1086
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:14,859
Doctor, such unprofessional behaviour.

1087
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:18,863
-lnto that little room, please.
-What is that, a gun?

1088
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,282
-Nurses.
-They must be crazy.

1089
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:23,993
-Who is this guy?
-l have no idea.

1090
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:33,377
He melted the lock.

1091
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:36,506
We're dealing with medievalism here.

1092
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:43,888
Chemotherapy,
funduscopic examinations.

1093
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:52,730
Come on, Chekov. Wake up.

1094
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:59,111
Pavel, can you hear me?

1095
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:05,117
He's coming around, Jim.

1096
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:08,996
Pavel, talk to me.

1097
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,416
Name. Rank.

1098
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:17,088
Chekov, Pavel.

1099
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:21,259
Rank, Admiral.

1100
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,764
-How's the patient, Doctor?
-He's gonna make it.

1101
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:30,893
-He? You came in with a she.
-One little mistake.

1102
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:35,606
Get us out of here!

1103
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,152
They've taken the patient.
Get some help.

1104
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,288
Hold it!

1105
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:52,832
Hold it! Police!

1106
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:58,588
Not now, Pavel.

1107
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,340
Hold it!

1108
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:04,886
Look out! Look out!

1109
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:12,184
The doctor gave me a pill,
and l grew a new kidney.

1110
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:13,895
-Fully functional?
-Fully functional.

1111
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:30,828
What the hell's going on?

1112
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:41,505
Freeze!

1113
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,303
Where would the whales be by now?

1114
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:48,888
At sea. lf you have a chart on board,
l'll show you.

1115
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:52,433
No, no, no. All l need is
the radio frequency to track them.

1116
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:55,978
What are you talking about?
l'm coming with you.

1117
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:58,272
You can't.
Our next stop is the 23rd century.

1118
01:27:58,357 --> 01:28:00,274
Well, l don't care. l've got nobody here.

1119
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:03,527
-l have got to help those whales!
-l haven't got time to argue with you,

1120
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:06,280
or to tell you
how much you've meant to us.

1121
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:08,449
The radio frequency, please.

1122
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,371
The frequency's 401 megahertz.

1123
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:17,458
Thank you, for everything.

1124
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:20,378
Scotty, beam me up.

1125
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:23,673
Surprise.

1126
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:31,639
Spock, where the hell's
the power you promised?

1127
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:32,848
One damn minute, Admiral.

1128
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:35,476
<i>I'm ready, Spock.</i>
<i>Let's go find George and Gracie.</i>

1129
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,061
-Sulu?
-l'm trying to remember

1130
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:39,397
how this thing worked.
l got used to a Huey.

1131
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:42,149
-You tricked me.
-You need me.

1132
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,944
-Ready, sir.
-Take a seat.

1133
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:46,153
Now, Mr Sulu.

1134
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:58,749
What the hell was that?

1135
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,509
Cloaking device is stable.
All systems normal.

1136
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:11,345
Stabilise energy reserve. Report, helm.

1137
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:15,433
Maintaining impulse climb.
Wing 5 by 0. Helm steady.

1138
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:19,854
-Advise reaching 1 0,000. Steer 31 0.
-31 0, aye.

1139
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:22,898
Uhura, scan for the whales.
401 megahertz.

1140
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:26,235
-Scanning, sir.
-1 0,000 MSL, Admiral.

1141
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:30,281
Wing, cruise configuration.
Full impulse power.

1142
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:34,660
Aye, sir. 31 0 to the Bering Sea.
ETA, 1 2 minutes.

1143
01:29:35,412 --> 01:29:36,912
Scotty, are the whale tanks secure?

1144
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:40,499
Aye, sir, but l've never beamed up
400 tons before.

1145
01:29:40,584 --> 01:29:44,920
-400 tons?
-lt's not just the whales. lt's the water.

1146
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:46,797
Yes, of course.

1147
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:53,220
-The whales, any contact?
-Negative, sir.

1148
01:30:00,771 --> 01:30:02,271
You...

1149
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:04,982
You present the appearance
of a man with a problem.

1150
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:07,151
Your perception is correct, Doctor.

1151
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:10,279
ln order to return us to the exact
moment we left the 23rd century,

1152
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:13,282
l have used ourjourney
back through time as a referent,

1153
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,201
calculating the coefficient
of elapsed time

1154
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:17,787
in relation to the acceleration curve.

1155
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:21,290
Naturally. So what's your problem?

1156
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:24,752
Acceleration is no longer a constant.

1157
01:30:25,504 --> 01:30:28,756
Well, then you're just gonna
have to take your best shot.

1158
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:33,469
-Best shot?
-Guess, Spock.

1159
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:37,264
-Your best guess.
-Guessing is not in my nature, Doctor.

1160
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:41,185
Well, nobody's perfect.

1161
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:06,710
-That's it. That's it!
-Affirmative. Contact with the whales.

1162
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:10,881
-Bearing.
-Bearing 3-2-7. Range 600 nautical.

1163
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,466
Put it on screen.

1164
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:15,219
-How can you do that?
-On screen.

1165
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:26,188
Admiral, l have a signal

1166
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:30,151
closing in on the whales,
bearing 328 degrees.

1167
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:31,318
Let's see it.

1168
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:40,035
-What kind of ship is that?
-lt's a whaling ship, Doctor.

1169
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:41,620
Are we too late?

1170
01:31:49,129 --> 01:31:52,798
-Full power descent, Mr Sulu.
-Aye, sir. Full power descent.

1171
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:12,836
1 0 seconds, sir.

1172
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:13,689
All right, Scotty. lt's up to you.

1173
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:15,524
1 0 seconds, Admiral.

1174
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:24,825
<i>5, 4, 3,</i>

1175
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:28,412
2, 1 .

1176
01:34:54,272 --> 01:34:57,483
Admiral, there be whales here!

1177
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:03,072
Well done, Mr Scott. How soon
can we be ready for warp speed?

1178
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:05,699
Full power now, sir.

1179
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:09,661
-lf you will, Mr Sulu.
-Aye, sir. Warp speed.

1180
01:35:15,502 --> 01:35:17,294
Mr Sulu, you have the conn.

1181
01:35:17,379 --> 01:35:19,963
l'm gonna take our guest down
and have a look at her whales.

1182
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:21,298
Mr Spock, have you accounted

1183
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:24,593
for the variable mass of whales and
water in your time re-entry programme?

1184
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:30,140
Mr Scott cannot give me exact figures,
Admiral, so l will make a guess.

1185
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:32,309
A guess?

1186
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:38,107
You, Spock? That's extraordinary.

1187
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:49,410
-l don't think he understands.
-No, Spock.

1188
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:51,954
He means that he feels safer
about your guesses

1189
01:35:52,038 --> 01:35:53,997
than most other people's facts.

1190
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:58,669
-Then you're saying it is a compliment?
-lt is.

1191
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:01,964
Then l will try
to make the best guess l can.

1192
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:13,058
"They say the sea is cold,

1193
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:16,145
"but the sea contains
the hottest blood of all."

1194
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:23,110
"Whales weep not."

1195
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,695
D.H. Lawrence.

1196
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:34,872
You know, it's ironic,
when man was killing these creatures,

1197
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:37,291
he was destroying his own future.

1198
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:42,963
The beasties seem
happy to see you, Doctor.

1199
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:47,634
-l hope you like our little aquarium.
-A miracle, Mr Scott.

1200
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:50,596
A miracle? That's yet to come.

1201
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,309
What does that mean?

1202
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:57,644
lt means that our chances
of getting home are not too good.

1203
01:36:57,729 --> 01:37:00,856
You might have lived a longer life
if you'd stayed where you belong.

1204
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:04,943
l belong here. l am a whale biologist.

1205
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:09,490
Suppose, by some miracle,
you do get them through.

1206
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:10,741
Who in the 23rd century

1207
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,493
knows anything
about humpback whales?

1208
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,244
You have a point.

1209
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:16,872
What was that?

1210
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:20,501
Admiral, l think
you'd better get up there.

1211
01:37:20,585 --> 01:37:22,336
We're having a power fall-off.

1212
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:25,547
Stay with them. On my way.

1213
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,595
Hold on tight, lassie.
lt gets bumpy from here.

1214
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,518
<i>Warp 7.5!</i>

1215
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:41,396
<i>7.9!</i>

1216
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:44,107
Shields at maximum.

1217
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:48,278
Mr Sulu, that's all l can give you!

1218
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:50,781
Can we make breakaway speed?

1219
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,908
Hardly, Admiral.
l cannot even guarantee

1220
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:54,826
we'll escape the sun's gravity.

1221
01:37:54,911 --> 01:37:58,372
l shall attempt to compensate
by altering our trajectory.

1222
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:01,959
Warp 8. 8.1 !

1223
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:05,212
Maximum speed, sir.

1224
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:08,382
Admiral, l need thruster control.

1225
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:11,343
Acceleration thrust
is at Spock's command.

1226
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:17,057
Steady. Steady.

1227
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:18,141
Now!

1228
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:42,165
Did braking thrusters fire?

1229
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,875
They did, Admiral.

1230
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:49,506
Then where the hell are we?

1231
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:55,679
The probe.

1232
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:02,519
Condition report, Spock.

1233
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:05,772
No data, Admiral.
Computers are nonfunctional.

1234
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:09,151
The mains are down, sir.
Aux power is not responding.

1235
01:39:13,031 --> 01:39:16,241
-Switch to manual control, Mr Sulu.
-l have no control, sir.

1236
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:22,831
-My God, Jim, where are we?
-Out of control and blind as a bat.

1237
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,542
Get him back, get him back!

1238
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:31,548
Look!

1239
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:34,926
They're heading for the bridge!

1240
01:39:49,067 --> 01:39:51,735
Ground the ship.
Keep the nose up if you can.

1241
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:11,922
We're in the water! Blow the hatch!

1242
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:17,761
lt's the right place, Spock.

1243
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:20,430
Now all we have to do is get the
whales out of here before we sink!

1244
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:23,225
Abandon ship. Scotty, do you hear me?

1245
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:26,645
Scotty! Damn it. Move! Move!

1246
01:40:26,729 --> 01:40:28,939
-See to the safety of all hands.
-l will.

1247
01:41:03,433 --> 01:41:06,143
-Lassie, get my arm.
-l got it. l got it.

1248
01:41:06,227 --> 01:41:07,978
-You got it?
-Yeah.

1249
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:11,231
-Scotty!
-Admiral!

1250
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:13,567
-l'm here, Scotty! l'm here!
-Help!

1251
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:27,247
-You're going to be all right.
-The whales are trapped. They'll drown.

1252
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:29,750
There's no power to the bay doors.

1253
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:32,669
-Explosive override.
-lt's underwater.

1254
01:41:32,754 --> 01:41:37,340
-There's no way you can reach it.
-You go on ahead and close the hatch.

1255
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:40,010
Admiral, you'll be trapped.

1256
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:41,636
Go on!

1257
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:08,098
Do you see them?

1258
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:30,161
There!

1259
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:41,006
Why don't they answer?

1260
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:43,633
Why don't they sing?

1261
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:05,335
Mr President, we have power.

1262
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:18,241
Council is now in session.

1263
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,536
lf you will all take your seats.

1264
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:25,123
Bring in the accused.

1265
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:42,182
Captain Spock,
you do not stand accused.

1266
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:45,560
Mr President,
l stand with my shipmates.

1267
01:48:46,437 --> 01:48:47,854
As you wish.

1268
01:48:48,939 --> 01:48:51,691
The charges and specifications are

1269
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:57,530
conspiracy,
assault on Federation officers,

1270
01:48:57,615 --> 01:49:02,869
theft of Federation property,
namely the Starship Enterprise,

1271
01:49:02,953 --> 01:49:07,040
sabotage of the U.S.S. Excelsior,

1272
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:10,710
wilful destruction
of Federation property,

1273
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:14,380
specifically the aforementioned
<i>U.S.S. Enterprise,</i>

1274
01:49:14,465 --> 01:49:16,090
and finally,

1275
01:49:16,175 --> 01:49:19,886
disobeying direct orders
of the Starfleet Commander.

1276
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:25,433
Admiral Kirk, how do you plead?

1277
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:31,731
On behalf of all of us, Mr President,
l'm authorised to plead guilty.

1278
01:49:33,484 --> 01:49:35,193
So entered.

1279
01:49:35,277 --> 01:49:38,738
Because of certain
mitigating circumstances,

1280
01:49:38,822 --> 01:49:42,825
all charges but one
are summarily dismissed.

1281
01:49:43,494 --> 01:49:48,373
The remaining charge,
disobeying orders of a superior officer,

1282
01:49:48,457 --> 01:49:51,626
is directed solely at Admiral Kirk.

1283
01:49:52,836 --> 01:49:54,462
l'm sure the Admiral will recognise

1284
01:49:54,546 --> 01:49:58,341
the necessity of keeping discipline
in any chain of command.

1285
01:49:59,969 --> 01:50:03,263
-l do, sir.
-James T. Kirk,

1286
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:08,434
it is the judgement of this council
that you be reduced in rank to captain,

1287
01:50:09,687 --> 01:50:12,939
and that as a consequence
of your new rank,

1288
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:14,607
you be given the duties for which

1289
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:18,987
you have repeatedly demonstrated
unswerving ability,

1290
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:21,781
the command of a starship.

1291
01:50:26,036 --> 01:50:30,581
Silence. Captain Kirk,
you and your crew

1292
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:34,627
have saved this planet from
its own shortsightedness,

1293
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:37,880
and we are forever in your debt.

1294
01:51:12,291 --> 01:51:13,833
Excuse me.

1295
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:17,003
l'm so happy for you, l can't tell you.

1296
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:18,755
Thank you so much.

1297
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:24,344
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

1298
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:27,597
You're going to your ship.
l'm going to mine. Science vessel.

1299
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:30,892
l got 300 years of catch-up learning
to do.

1300
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:35,021
-You mean this is goodbye?
-Why does it have to be goodbye?

1301
01:51:35,814 --> 01:51:37,023
Well...

1302
01:51:38,233 --> 01:51:41,778
Like they say in your century, l don't
even have your telephone number.

1303
01:51:42,613 --> 01:51:44,405
How will l find you?

1304
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:46,949
Don't worry.

1305
01:51:48,035 --> 01:51:49,535
l'll find you.

1306
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:57,293
See you around the galaxy.

1307
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:13,309
Father.

1308
01:52:13,977 --> 01:52:18,106
l'm returning to Vulcan within the hour.
l'd like to take my leave of you.

1309
01:52:18,982 --> 01:52:21,359
lt was most kind of you
to make this effort.

1310
01:52:21,443 --> 01:52:24,779
lt was no effort. You are my son.

1311
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:31,744
Besides, l'm most impressed with
your performance in this crisis.

1312
01:52:32,830 --> 01:52:34,163
Most kind.

1313
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:37,083
As l recall,

1314
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:40,753
l opposed your enlistment in Starfleet.

1315
01:52:40,838 --> 01:52:43,673
lt is possible
that judgement was incorrect.

1316
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:48,261
Your associates
are people of good character.

1317
01:52:50,013 --> 01:52:51,806
They are my friends.

1318
01:52:53,434 --> 01:52:54,976
Yes, of course.

1319
01:52:57,354 --> 01:53:00,189
Do you have a message
for your mother?

1320
01:53:00,274 --> 01:53:01,357
Yes.

1321
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:05,153
Tell her l feel fine.

1322
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,825
Live long and prosper, Father.

1323
01:53:12,035 --> 01:53:14,579
Live long and prosper, my son.

1324
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:49,906
The bureaucratic mentality
is the only constant in the universe.

1325
01:53:50,741 --> 01:53:52,366
We'll get a freighter.

1326
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:55,578
With all respect, Doctor,
l'm counting on Excelsior.

1327
01:53:55,662 --> 01:54:00,249
Excelsior? Why in God's name
would you want that bucket of bolts?

1328
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:02,210
A ship is a ship.

1329
01:54:02,294 --> 01:54:05,880
Whatever you say, sir. Thy will be done.

1330
01:54:32,115 --> 01:54:35,660
My friends, we've come home.

1331
01:54:46,338 --> 01:54:49,215
-Helm ready, Captain.
-All right, Mr Sulu.
