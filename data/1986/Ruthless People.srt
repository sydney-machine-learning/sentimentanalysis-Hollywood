25
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,007
Carol, did I ever tell you
why I married her?

26
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:18,558
Yes, Sam, you told me
many, many...

27
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:21,632
Her father was
very, very rich...

28
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:23,842
and very, very sick.

29
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:27,141
The doctors assured me
he'd be dead any minute.

30
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:29,697
There wasn't
a second to lose.

31
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:32,670
I rushed right out and
married the boss's daughter.

32
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,593
He was so sick!

33
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:38,112
It was like the angel of death
was sittin' in the room with him,

34
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:41,823
watchin' the clock.

35
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:44,710
They pulled the plug
on him.

36
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,150
He wheezed and shook
for about an hour.

37
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,450
And then...

38
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:54,530
he stabilized.

39
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,879
That son of a bitch
just got older and sicker.

40
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,049
And older and sicker!

41
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,967
And older and sicker!

42
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:07,041
- More coffee, sir?
- No!

43
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:11,869
I couldn't wait around any longer.
I went out and made my own fortune.

44
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:16,319
The old fart hung in there
for 15 years!

45
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:19,071
Finally died
of natural causes.

46
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:21,531
I want the rest
of that money!

47
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:25,084
His money, her money,
it's my money!

48
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:29,726
I had to live with that squealing,
corpulent little toad all these years!

49
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:32,732
God, I hate that woman!
I-I-I...

50
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:35,744
I hate the way
she licks stamps.

51
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:37,786
I hate her furniture.

52
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:42,169
And I hate that little sound
she makes when she sleeps.

53
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:43,269
Ohhh!

54
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:53,082
And that filthy, little
shitbag dog of hers... Muffy!

55
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:57,211
- Aren't you scared?
- Scared?

56
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:00,989
Hell, no.
I'm lookin' forward to it.

57
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:03,099
My only regret, Carol,

58
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,748
is that the plan
isn't more violent.

59
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:12,157
Don't you consider throwing a body
off a cliff in the dead of night violent?

60
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:16,190
Nah! She'll be unconscious,
knocked out from the chloroform.

61
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,088
I'm talkin' about
hands-on involvement.

62
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:21,988
Hands-on?

63
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,561
Ohh. Ohh!

64
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:30,046
Oh-ho!

65
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,063
I'm goin' now. I can't wait.

66
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,060
Good luck.

67
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,406
Barbara, dear,
I have something for you.

68
00:05:20,594 --> 00:05:22,194
Barbara?

69
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:26,456
Where are you, dearest?

70
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:28,650
I have something for you.

71
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:33,437
Honey?

72
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:41,969
Barbara?

73
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:55,739
Dumpling?

74
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,210
Barbara?

75
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:12,086
No notes,
no messages.

76
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,454
This is not like you,
you meticulous bitch!

77
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:17,399
It's just like that woman
to screw this up.

78
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:19,099
Damn it!

79
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:29,722
What are you doin' here?
Mining the carpet with little poodle bombs?

80
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,210
Here! Take a whiff of this,
you little fruitcake.

81
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,709
I'll kill you!

82
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:38,629
I'll wring your neck!

83
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,105
You hairy rat!

84
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:06,039
- Hello.
- Mr.Stone?

85
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,204
Listen very carefully.
We have kidnapped your wife.

86
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:13,074
We have no qualms about killing and
will do so at the slightest provocation.

87
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:15,960
- Do you understand?
- Who the hell is this? Is this some joke?

88
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,568
I have no patience for stupid questions, Mr.Stone,
and I don't like repeating myself.

89
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:22,645
Do you understand?

90
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:25,430
All right, I'm sorry.
Please continue.

91
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,821
You are to obtain a new, black
American Tourister briefcase,

92
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:32,661
- model number 8104. Do you understand?
- Yes.

93
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:34,963
In it you will place
$500,000 in unmarked,

94
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:38,353
nonsequentially
numbered $100 bills.

95
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:40,631
- Do you understand?
- Sure.

96
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:43,158
Monday morning at 11:00 a.m.,
you will proceed with case in hand,

97
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:45,876
to Hope Street Plaza and
wait for a phone to ring.

98
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:47,957
You will receive
further instructions then.

99
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:50,230
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I do.

100
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,599
You'll be watched at
all phases of execution.

101
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,598
If anyone is with you or if any action is not
carried out to our complete satisfaction,

102
00:07:56,698 --> 00:08:00,660
it will be considered an infraction of the rules,
and your wife will be killed.

103
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,316
- Do you understand?
- I believe so.

104
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,330
If you notify the police,
your wife will be killed.

105
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,703
If you notify the media,
she will be killed.

106
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:11,765
If you deviate from our instructions in
any way whatsoever, she will be killed.

107
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:16,160
- Do you understand?
- Perfectly.

108
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:23,124
Just 45 minutes ago,
Mr.Stone received a call...

109
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:26,785
from a man demanding
a ransom for his wife, Barbara.

110
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:50,973
Kenny!

111
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:58,941
Grab her legs.

112
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
Aah!

113
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,234
Do you think
she's dead?

114
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:36,843
Aah!

115
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:15,251
You fucked
with the wrong person!

116
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:17,774
My husband does business
with the Mafia.

117
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:21,456
When they track you down, you,
your entire family, everyone you ever knew...

118
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:25,501
will all get chain saw enemas
and that's not all!

119
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:31,773
Oh, my God!
I've been abducted by Huey and Duey.

120
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:34,672
An...

121
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:38,992
Jesus Christ!
It smells like a toilet in here!

122
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:42,286
- It's just the ammonia. - We scrubbed down
here for hours on our hands and knees,

123
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:44,209
For God's sake.

124
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:48,433
My husband worships the ground I walk on!
Wait till he hears about this!

125
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:51,586
He will explo-o-ode!

126
00:10:56,832 --> 00:10:59,471
Bye-bye, Barbara.

127
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:02,353
In local news, a kidnapping
today in Bel Air.

128
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,846
Police tell us this woman,
Barbara Stone,

129
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:07,249
the wife of clothing tycoon,
Sam Stone,

130
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:11,440
was abducted earlier today from the
couple's estate on Bellagio Drive.

131
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,760
Preliminary sources indicated that Mr.Stone
was contacted late this afternoon...

132
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,836
and that a ransom demand
has been made. Police officials...

133
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:20,588
...kill Mrs.Stone
if demands were not met.

134
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:22,511
It's on every
goddamn channel!

135
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:25,580
Millionaire heiress, Barbara Stone,
has been kidnapped...

136
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,791
from her
Bel Air mansion.

137
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:29,838
What'd he do,
hire a publicist?

138
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:34,475
I feel terrible.
Do you feel as guilty as I do?

139
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:36,455
Guilty?
Are you kidding?

140
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:39,663
He takes our money,
steals your idea,

141
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:43,458
goes out and makes a million dollars,
and you feel guilty?

142
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:49,742
I can't
believe it!

143
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,933
- How many times have we been over this?
- Oh, honey, not again.

144
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:56,077
Let me remind you
of something.

145
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:59,021
You are the spandex
miniskirt king.

146
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:02,190
Not him.
He is the spandex miniskirt thief.

147
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,388
He's the one
who should feel guilty.

148
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:08,241
Look at this.
Do you remember this?

149
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:12,298
You cried for a week when you saw this.
Look at the smile on that asshole.

150
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,914
I know he stole it, but she
really didn't do anything.

151
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:19,500
She was his partner!
Oh, damn it, Sandy.

152
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,473
Do you enjoy
getting stepped on? Do you?

153
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:26,506
'Cause I don't,
and I don't feel guilty.

154
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:29,225
I take it back.
I do feel guilty.

155
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:33,161
I feel very guilty.
I trusted a sleazeball like Sam Stone...

156
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:35,655
with our life savings
on a handshake deal,

157
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,704
and then sat there and watched
him take it all away from us.

158
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,554
But that's over.
We know better now.

159
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:46,928
From now on,
we trust no one.

160
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:50,347
To hell with everybody else.
We've got to be ruthless.

161
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,874
- Think ruthless.
- What if I can't think ruthless?

162
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,693
You've got to. It's good for you.
It makes you strong.

163
00:12:55,793 --> 00:13:00,973
What the hell's the sense of being a
decent person when nobody else is?

164
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:04,322
Let's be assholes
and get rich!

165
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,711
Oh, oh! I'm crazy about you,
you big galoot!

166
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:24,459
Ooh, you were
somethin' today!

167
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,683
- Yeah, it just doesn't get any better than this.
- Mmm.

168
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:30,692
I'm gonna take
a quick shower.

169
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:34,154
- Can you be ready by the time I get out?
- Ready?

170
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,134
You're getting ready
for Sam.

171
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:38,825
The video equipment,
remember?

172
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:42,157
- Tonight's the night.
- Oh yeah, I knew that.

173
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:45,005
- Now, do you remember where I told you to go?
- Yeah.

174
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:48,424
- The old deserted bridge near the Hollywood sign.
- That's right.

175
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:51,622
You wait for him there.
He'll be in some rented car.

176
00:13:51,722 --> 00:13:54,538
He's afraid of getting blood
on his sports car.

177
00:13:54,638 --> 00:13:56,681
Get in as close
as you can.

178
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:59,333
It's important you get
a good shot of his face.

179
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:02,023
If we can't recognize him,
we can't blackmail him.

180
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:06,631
You get that videotape of Sam
finishing off his wife,

181
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:09,287
and that man will give us
anything we want...

182
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:12,107
for the rest of his life.

183
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:15,943
Yeah, then we're off
to Haiti.

184
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:19,643
Not Haiti, Tahiti!

185
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:22,440
I knew that.

186
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,176
The passports
came today.

187
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:31,585
Cool.

188
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:42,987
- Frank, glad you're here.
- What have we got?

189
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:46,276
We found a chloroform-soaked handkerchief
stuffed way down in the garbage,

190
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:50,055
and a tire print on the lawn, a good one.
I'm having the lab check it out.

191
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,610
And we found a few drops
of blood in the kitchen.

192
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,533
- Where's Mr.Stone?
- He's upstairs.

193
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:57,370
He seems
pretty upset.

194
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:01,477
Yes?

195
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,893
Mr.Stone,
Lieutenant Bender and Walters are here.

196
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:08,453
They'd like to start
as soon as possible.

197
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:11,572
I'll be right there.

198
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,781
Ow!
Oh, oh!

199
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:44,085
Hee-hee-hee.

200
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:33,253
- I like to hear a woman make a lot of sound.
- Uh-huh.

201
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:36,514
I'll scream my head off if you want to, honey.
It's your money.

202
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:39,149
My wife just lays there
like a gunnysack.

203
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:49,571
Oh, my God.
She isn't dead yet.

204
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:52,143
He's gonna kill her right here!

205
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:01,139
Oh, oh.

206
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:30,113
I have no enemies,
at least none that I know of.

207
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:32,189
I... I'm a businessman.

208
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,133
I manufacture
women's sportswear.

209
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,056
I think I've heard of you.

210
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,355
Don't they call you
the "spandex king"?

211
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:44,191
The "spandex miniskirt king."
You probably read one of the articles.

212
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,039
Yeah, it was all his idea...
spandex miniskirts.

213
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:50,405
Was there anybody here today when you came home?
Servants?

214
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:53,374
- Maids?
- It was the maid's day off.

215
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:56,735
Did you notice anything out of the
ordinary when you came home?

216
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:58,658
No, not that
I can remember.

217
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:01,506
- What time did you come home?
- It's the dog!

218
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:05,862
She isn't
properly house-trained.

219
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,564
No, it's sweet.

220
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:13,086
The dog's
a little diabetic.

221
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:15,196
I think it's wine...

222
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:18,619
- Or...
- Oh, I know what that must be.

223
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:22,489
I... I closed a very
important business deal...

224
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:24,767
this morning and
when I came home...

225
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:28,665
I opened a bottle of champagne
and... and as I was...

226
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:32,702
walking through the house,
celebrating,

227
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:36,435
I called to Barbara to come
and share the moment with me.

228
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:40,638
She never came.

229
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:43,091
Those monsters!

230
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,799
Earl!

231
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,414
It was horrible.

232
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:58,687
- She wasn't drugged or anything.
- What happened?

233
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,696
She screamed
and screamed.

234
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:04,863
God, it took forever.
It must have lasted... two minutes.

235
00:19:04,963 --> 00:19:08,027
He kept stopping and starting.
She'd be at the brink of death and he'd stop,

236
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:10,108
let her catch her breath
then start into her again!

237
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,115
She'd scream
louder and louder and then,

238
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:15,805
when she finally died,

239
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,291
he looked so satisfied I thought he was
gonna light up a cigarette afterwards.

240
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,365
Son of a bitch
enjoyed it!

241
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:26,114
Sam's just been on TV
claiming she was kidnapped.

242
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:28,378
She wasn't kidnapped.
He killed her. I saw it.

243
00:19:28,478 --> 00:19:31,101
Honey, I know.
It's just an alibi.

244
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:34,237
He just said that
to throw the police off his trail.

245
00:19:34,337 --> 00:19:36,347
You gonna watch that
right now?

246
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:38,620
- I think I should.
- Baby, you don't wanna see it.

247
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,852
- It'll make you sick.
- I think I can take it.

248
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:43,352
Oh, no!

249
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:51,152
Ooh! I can't watch this.

250
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:59,083
He actually
went through with it.

251
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,714
- Stay in here. Don't come out.
- What?

252
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:09,014
Sam's here!

253
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:13,853
Ta-da!

254
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:17,690
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah
Zip-a-dee-ay

255
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,209
My, oh, my
what a wonderful day

256
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:23,319
I've just been
watching you on TV.

257
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:25,563
- You saw it, huh?
- Good performance, Sam.

258
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:29,342
What a story!
Barbara Stone kidnapped!

259
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:32,151
I couldn't have made up
anything better. It's brilliant!

260
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,170
And the press
loves it.

261
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,845
- Well, that's very clever, Sam.
- It's inspired!

262
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:43,832
Imagine, someone demanding money
from me to keep Barbara alive.

263
00:20:43,932 --> 00:20:47,702
Unbelievable!
Idiots!

264
00:20:47,802 --> 00:20:49,687
Come on,
let's have a drink.

265
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:51,610
I can't stay long.

266
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,746
I've gotta get back
and look sad.

267
00:20:54,846 --> 00:20:57,949
- Are you sure the police believed you?
- They ate it up!

268
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,250
I fed 'em a banquet
of bullshit.

269
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,799
I threw 'em off by miles.
All I have to do now...

270
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:06,359
is just sit back
and do nothing,

271
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:10,392
except, of course,
I have to show up at the fictitious ransom drop.

272
00:21:10,492 --> 00:21:13,111
- You made up your own ransom drop?
- Naturally!

273
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:17,076
I got news for you,
Carol.

274
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,517
That woman
ain't comin' back.

275
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,017
I know.

276
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:24,954
Did you have
any trouble?

277
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:27,640
No, I'm tellin' you
I enjoyed it.

278
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,740
I'm havin' fun!

279
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:33,574
We'll clean the rug,
honey.

280
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:38,582
For you, my cupcake.

281
00:21:38,682 --> 00:21:40,526
To the kidnappers.

282
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:51,660
To the future
Mrs. Sam Stone.

283
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:57,973
Whoops!
I gotta run. I'm sorry, honey.

284
00:21:58,073 --> 00:22:02,840
I was hopin' we'd have time
for little... poke in the whiskers.

285
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,779
- What a shame.
- I'll take a rain check,

286
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:07,707
and a few
of these bonbons.

287
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:10,421
~ <i>Zip-a-dee-doo-dah</i> ~

288
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:14,446
~ <i>Zip-a-dee-ay</i> ~

289
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:18,007
Rock always
whines abuse at the opponent too.

290
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:21,334
Yes, and I think Murdo's
gonna get a taste of it tonight.

291
00:22:21,434 --> 00:22:24,020
Ooh my, look at
all that hair,

292
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,993
or, uh, fur,
if you would.

293
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:30,138
He doesn't need a coat in wintertime.

294
00:22:30,238 --> 00:22:33,799
He'll just walk around
like that and have plenty of heat.

295
00:22:42,248 --> 00:22:44,048
You okay?

296
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:07,223
- She's out!
- Help, police!

297
00:23:07,323 --> 00:23:09,395
- Get the chloroform!
- Come back, honey.

298
00:23:09,495 --> 00:23:12,006
Police!
Somebody help me!

299
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:16,242
Get me the police. I've been kidnapped.

300
00:23:16,342 --> 00:23:19,812
How the hell do I know
where I am?

301
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:22,702
Good.

302
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:26,806
Now, be quiet
and don't move.

303
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:30,822
Nice faces...
Nice easily-identifiable faces.

304
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:38,302
- Boo!
- I can't do this anymore!

305
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:43,107
Ow!
God, that hurts!

306
00:23:59,084 --> 00:24:02,084
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

307
00:24:19,683 --> 00:24:21,683
Whee-aaah!

308
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:24,119
Oh! Ahh!

309
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,365
Aaah!

310
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:04,399
This is Sergeant Blake
at the lab.

311
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:09,199
I'd like a purchase search
on Uniroyal model NXP.

312
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,834
That's right,
for all of LA County.

313
00:25:14,116 --> 00:25:15,950
This is Action News Break.

314
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,194
Police are now at the scene of
a brutal murder in Inglewood...

315
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:22,702
they believe may be the result of
another attack by the "bedroom killer."

316
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:28,144
Investigators are asking anyone who may have
seen this man to contact them at 555-3421.

317
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:32,205
Police have also issued a warning
that this man is extremely dangerous,

318
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:35,054
and citizens should not attempt
to apprehend him.

319
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:37,677
This is Action News Break.
I'm Rick DeReyes.

320
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:40,096
Away it goes!
Trying to beat...

321
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:44,140
Money, better times, girls.

322
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,535
Six. Keep going.
Steady, nice and tall.

323
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:51,501
Come on, and knees up,
feet straight. Get those heels down.

324
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:55,382
And pull those abdominals in.
Pull 'em in, suck 'em up.

325
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,412
If you're still on that couch
eating that doughnut,

326
00:26:10,512 --> 00:26:12,340
put it down
and get up!

327
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,013
Three, four,
standing nice and tall.

328
00:26:16,113 --> 00:26:19,216
Heels down and front.
Come on, reach.

329
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:22,052
Shh, shh, shh.

330
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:33,357
Come on, get those
pepperoni thighs nice and high.

331
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:37,869
And reach! Do it a little higher.
Squeeze those buns.

332
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:41,300
Remember, if you don't,
no one else will.

333
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:48,619
And don't forget to breathe.

334
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:51,242
What if he
doesn't show?

335
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:54,745
Oh, well then
you get to keep her.

336
00:27:00,163 --> 00:27:03,357
Everything's
gonna work.

337
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,099
I'll call you.

338
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:18,857
Sandy,
he's gonna show!

339
00:27:18,957 --> 00:27:21,434
It's his wife.

340
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:33,460
Where are you, Sam?

341
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:46,188
You son of a bitch!

342
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:48,845
I'm gonna turn
your transmitter on.

343
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:51,530
- He can't see the microphone?
- No, it looks fine.

344
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,913
Mr.Stone,
telephone.

345
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:03,335
- Hello?
- Mr.Stone, we had a meeting.

346
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:06,126
Hang on, will ya, Harry?
I have some friends here.

347
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:11,626
Call me on my office line,
555-7583. Right?

348
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:14,536
Business associate.

349
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:18,436
555-7583.
555-7583.

350
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:25,228
Hello?

351
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:30,250
Mr.Stone, why have you failed to
appear at the designated destination?

352
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,901
Ahem. I just
couldn't make it.

353
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,829
The cops are there,
aren't they?

354
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:36,905
That's right, the cops
are here, reporters too.

355
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:41,130
All right, Mr.Stone.
I'm a reasonable man.

356
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,753
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

357
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:46,951
We will reschedule
our rendezvous for Wednesday.

358
00:28:47,051 --> 00:28:50,317
- Do you understand?
- You're rescheduling?

359
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:52,235
Yes, I am.

360
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:56,613
- So, she's still alive?
- She's in perfect health.

361
00:28:56,713 --> 00:29:00,133
Uh, in our
previous discussion,

362
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:02,185
you mentioned that
you would, uh...

363
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:05,383
kill my wife if procedure
wasn't followed accurately.

364
00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:08,107
- That's correct.
- And that still goes?

365
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:12,005
- Definitely!
- Uh, what method would you use?

366
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:14,470
How would
you kill her?

367
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,610
A bullet through the head
at close range.

368
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,125
That would do it,
no question.

369
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:24,148
Um, well,
you've got me convinced.

370
00:29:25,817 --> 00:29:28,915
- Until Wednesday.
- Until Wednesday, then.

371
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:33,481
Muffy,

372
00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:37,239
you've taken your
last piss on my rug.

373
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:41,413
Tell Mr.Stone it's time
to leave for the ransom drop.

374
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,460
I hope he's not...

375
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,275
Oh, my God!

376
00:29:49,437 --> 00:29:52,334
It just...
It just went off.

377
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:06,309
~ <i>Coast to coast</i>
<i>via satellite</i> ~

378
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:09,579
~ <i>The greatest show</i>
<i>in town</i> ~

379
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,149
~ <i>Tonight we crown</i>
<i>the champion, yeah</i> ~

380
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:17,601
~ <i>So spread</i>
<i>the word around</i> ~

381
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:22,343
~ <i>Who's the best</i>

382
00:30:22,443 --> 00:30:25,745
~ <i>Who's got that look</i>
<i>in their eyes</i> ~

383
00:30:25,981 --> 00:30:27,779
Better give him
a call.

384
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,371
- Hello?
- This is Bender.

385
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,932
It's been over an hour
and he hasn't shown up.

386
00:30:49,032 --> 00:30:52,001
If they haven't come by now,
I don't think they're gonna show.

387
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:55,436
Why don't you go on home?
We'll send an unmarked car to follow you.

388
00:30:56,884 --> 00:30:59,407
All right.
All right.

389
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:07,781
Give me all your money, Jack!
Come on, before I kill you.

390
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:10,337
Come on!
Come on!

391
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:12,260
- Here you go.
- Give me your wallet.

392
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,945
Come on, before I stick this
right through your back.

393
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:18,335
- All right, here you go. My wallet.
- Give me all your jewelry,

394
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,896
- your watch, rings, everything.
- Jewelry, watch.

395
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:24,245
You want my underwear too,
you piece of shit? Here.

396
00:31:27,381 --> 00:31:31,063
You know, this town has got
some Neighborhood Watch!

397
00:31:32,444 --> 00:31:34,787
I brought you
some more magazines.

398
00:31:34,887 --> 00:31:38,019
More magazines?
How long do you plan on keeping me down here?

399
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:41,538
Well, as soon as
Mr.Stone pays the ransom.

400
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:46,913
- It should be Monday.
- Good. I'd hate to miss my doctor's appointment.

401
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:49,829
Doctor's appointment?
Why, do you need medication?

402
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:51,871
I get a
urine injection.

403
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:53,857
You get
urine injected?

404
00:31:53,957 --> 00:31:56,230
- Why?
- It promotes weight loss.

405
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:00,917
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it works!

406
00:32:03,602 --> 00:32:08,961
"Lancome throat and firming massage cream.
Sperm whale oil.

407
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:12,639
Royal queen bee jelly."
I can't get you these things. We can't afford it.

408
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:15,842
That's not my problem,
it's yours.

409
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:19,361
Supply these things and I will
tell the jury you acted humanely.

410
00:32:19,461 --> 00:32:22,847
It might make the difference
between life...

411
00:32:22,947 --> 00:32:25,075
and the chair!

412
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,528
Or the gas chamber.
Ssss.

413
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,969
Sometimes,
if it's a firing squad,

414
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:47,518
they miss all
the major arteries.

415
00:32:47,618 --> 00:32:51,747
Bang!
And you don't die right away.

416
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:56,767
You kinda just...
hang on, bleeding.

417
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:58,667
Bleeding.

418
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:00,874
Bleeding...

419
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:04,869
Endlessly.

420
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:13,699
Now, I want you to mail this
from across town.

421
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,700
I don't want him seeing
a postmark from my neighborhood.

422
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,453
Right. You're
good at this.

423
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:24,861
- We can't be too careful with Sam.
He's a very suspicious man. - Yeah.

424
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,280
- I've got to see him one more time.
- You do?

425
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,447
If I don't see him on his birthday,
he'll be very, very suspicious.

426
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:35,650
He'll be expecting
his usual present.

427
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,515
It's been horrible.

428
00:33:39,615 --> 00:33:42,368
No matter what I do
or as nice as I can be,

429
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:45,154
she just
tears into me.

430
00:33:45,254 --> 00:33:49,407
- She hates me.
- Sandy, you're her kidnapper.

431
00:33:49,507 --> 00:33:52,622
She's supposed
to hate you.

432
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:55,521
I'll take it.

433
00:33:55,621 --> 00:33:58,110
- Okay.
- Just ignore her.

434
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,610
Heyaah!

435
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:09,921
- No dinner for you, then.
- Ah, gee whiz!

436
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:13,052
That really hurts.
I'm a real aficionado of death-camp cuisine.

437
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:14,152
Look,

438
00:34:15,075 --> 00:34:18,973
as long as you're here,
why don't you just pretend...

439
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:21,241
to be a guest.

440
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:23,341
Nice butt.

441
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:28,156
- That's what they'll say.
- I beg your pardon?

442
00:34:28,256 --> 00:34:32,251
Nice butt. That's what
they'll say on your first day...

443
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:34,332
in the men's club.

444
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:36,255
- Men's club?
- Mmm.

445
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:38,494
The San Quentin
country club.

446
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:41,755
With a cute little rear end like that,
you'll be the belle of the ball.

447
00:34:41,855 --> 00:34:44,862
Your dance card'll
be filled every day.

448
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:46,972
You'll be so popular,

449
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:50,012
making all kinds of
new, close friends.

450
00:34:50,112 --> 00:34:52,567
Big, ugly
hairy friends!

451
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:55,099
Not that you'll ever see
what they look like,

452
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,890
'cause you'll be facing
the other way.

453
00:35:02,831 --> 00:35:04,891
You're very good
at this.

454
00:35:04,991 --> 00:35:07,051
You should write
children's books.

455
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:15,449
Get outta here, you crotch wet.

456
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:18,139
Go on, get!
Goddamn you, dog!

457
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,079
Yes, your attack dogs,

458
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:26,183
do they just attack people, or can
you get them to attack little dogs?

459
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:31,400
Oh. Well, what if
you starve them for awhile?

460
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:36,217
Oh. All right,
thank you.

461
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:37,317
Yeah?

462
00:35:38,776 --> 00:35:42,968
- Miss Farnsworth to see you.
- Send her in.

463
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:46,217
Happy birthday, Sam.

464
00:35:51,597 --> 00:35:55,262
I brought you
your present.

465
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,197
Oh yeah?
Where is it?

466
00:35:59,662 --> 00:36:04,862
Here it is, Sam.
Does it meet with your satisfaction?

467
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:09,015
- Mmm.
- Is there anything else you desire?

468
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:11,671
How 'bout
a big dog?

469
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:16,245
- Can you get one?
- A big dog?

470
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:20,633
Yeah, like a Great Dane or a mastiff.
How big does a shepherd get?

471
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:25,591
Sam, as sexually provocative
as I like to think I am...

472
00:36:25,691 --> 00:36:29,911
I'm not askin' you
to screw the dog, Carol.

473
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:32,411
It's for me.

474
00:36:38,415 --> 00:36:40,854
See, that's what I've got,
the Dominator X-1.

475
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:43,644
- It's the best speaker they carry.
- It's really pretty.

476
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,850
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, uh...

477
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,768
- Hi.
- Hi.

478
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:51,067
Candy's here to get a stereo,
and I'm here to see she doesn't get ripped off.

479
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,299
Don't worry,
I'm not like the others.

480
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:56,279
How much did you
want to spend?

481
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:58,519
- $800.
- $500.

482
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,779
Okay, I think I have an idea
what to show you.

483
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:04,531
- Let's start with speakers.
- Okay.

484
00:37:04,631 --> 00:37:07,922
Over here, we have a great speaker,
Sentry EV-1.

485
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:10,808
Consumer Stereo has
just rated this a best buy.

486
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:13,877
- I have a pair myself.
- Yeah, uh, what do you think of this one?

487
00:37:13,977 --> 00:37:17,092
The Dominator X-1?

488
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,849
The Dominator's a good
marketing idea,

489
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:23,477
but it's really not
a good speaker.

490
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:27,831
We give it a 500 % markup,
so we sell it at 50 % off,

491
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:30,324
give the customer the illusion
he's getting a deal,

492
00:37:30,424 --> 00:37:32,247
and we still make
a bundle.

493
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:36,054
- But it's so big and impressive!
- Size means very little.

494
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:39,219
Bigger is not
necessarily better.

495
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:42,084
I sound like Dr.Ruth.

496
00:37:43,724 --> 00:37:47,284
- You mean the Dominator's like a, uh...
- Well,

497
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:50,770
the Dominators are very popular
with men who like to have bigger...

498
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,870
uh...

499
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:55,683
- Equipment?
- Exactly!

500
00:37:58,598 --> 00:38:00,595
All right,
let's try this one.

501
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,551
Knees bent down,
hips tucked under.

502
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:06,133
We're gonna work on the waist. We're gonna
loosen it up. Take the arms left and right.

503
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:09,586
Out, and reach as far
as you can.

504
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:11,729
Keep going.
Okay, left.

505
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:15,153
This time hold it over to the left.
Reach as far as you can.

506
00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:17,747
Reach the right arm
up to it and take it out.

507
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:21,233
Very slowly twist
through the rib cage.

508
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:25,203
Slowly lengthen,
lift that right leg up and hold it.

509
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,303
Aaah!

510
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,811
Keep holding it. Great!
Doesn't that feel good?

511
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:37,333
Muffy?

512
00:38:38,077 --> 00:38:40,077
Oh, Muffy?

513
00:38:44,295 --> 00:38:47,442
Muffy, meet Adolph.

514
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:50,346
Adolph, eat Muffy!

515
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:55,812
Bon appetit, Adolph.

516
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:02,180
Junk, garbage,
garbage, junk.

517
00:39:04,328 --> 00:39:07,109
What do we got here?

518
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:35,531
Oh-ho-ho.

519
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:46,191
"I thought you might find
this interesting.

520
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:48,944
An Anonymous Friend."

521
00:39:49,044 --> 00:39:50,044
More!

522
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:03,444
- Hello.
- Carol, I got your tape.

523
00:40:03,544 --> 00:40:06,225
What are you talking about?

524
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:08,594
The tape...
the videotape.

525
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:10,962
What makes you think
it was me?

526
00:40:11,062 --> 00:40:14,048
Who else would send me
something like this?

527
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:18,447
It's Sam.
He's onto us.

528
00:40:18,547 --> 00:40:22,221
How in the hell did you
get this, Carol?

529
00:40:22,321 --> 00:40:24,149
A friend of mine
took it.

530
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:27,793
It's terrific. I know why
you sent me this tape, honey.

531
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,802
And you know what
I'm gonna do?

532
00:40:29,902 --> 00:40:33,806
I'm gonna do the same
damn thing with you.

533
00:40:33,906 --> 00:40:39,114
And you, too, could scream your brains
out because no one's gonna hear.

534
00:40:39,214 --> 00:40:43,118
You are gonna be
beggin' me for mercy,

535
00:40:43,218 --> 00:40:45,041
whimpering.

536
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:47,280
Oh, here she goes again.
Listen to this.

537
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,253
This is my
favorite part.

538
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:03,631
He's gonna kill me.
He's gonna torture me and kill me.

539
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:07,330
I can't stay here.
I'm gonna have to stay...

540
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:10,658
at your place.

541
00:41:27,872 --> 00:41:32,447
Don't worry, honey.
Stay here as long as you want.

542
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:35,504
Oh, shoot!

543
00:41:35,604 --> 00:41:38,443
Crockett and Tubbs,
they're floatin'.

544
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:40,524
I can't
just sit here and wait for him...

545
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:43,406
to track me down
and kill me.

546
00:41:43,506 --> 00:41:46,621
We've got to get Sam
put in jail.

547
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:50,891
I want you to make
another copy of that tape,

548
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:52,922
and this one's
for the police.

549
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:15,048
So, I guess it's just a matter of time
before you're caught,

550
00:42:15,148 --> 00:42:18,038
right, honeybun?

551
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:22,775
Barbara, I want to ask you
a personal question.

552
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:27,129
You and
Mr.Stone,

553
00:42:27,906 --> 00:42:30,965
did you get along?

554
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,417
So, what did
she say?

555
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:40,249
She just
insulted me.

556
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,977
I don't think
he loves her.

557
00:42:44,077 --> 00:42:48,393
Let's face it, she's not Mother Teresa.
Gandhi would have strangled her.

558
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:50,920
What are we
gonna do, Kenny?

559
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,993
I'm tired of being scared
all the time every day.

560
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:56,103
I can't take this
anymore.

561
00:42:56,203 --> 00:42:58,568
I know he's bluffing.

562
00:42:58,668 --> 00:43:00,548
I just know it.

563
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:05,741
I've got to be
really tough with him.

564
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:09,189
Never let the seller know
you're hot to trot.

565
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:11,416
Tell him you
haven't got the money.

566
00:43:14,399 --> 00:43:16,904
Hello.
Debbie?

567
00:43:17,004 --> 00:43:20,232
Yeah, Debbie's here.
Who's this?

568
00:43:20,332 --> 00:43:24,039
Well, Ralph, Debbie can't talk right now.
My dick's in her mouth.

569
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:27,175
How 'bout if I have
her call you back when I'm done.

570
00:43:27,275 --> 00:43:29,223
I love wrong numbers.

571
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:32,742
Anyway, tell 'em
you don't have the money,

572
00:43:32,842 --> 00:43:35,449
that it's all tied up
in investments or some crap.

573
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:41,220
Hang on! A bad salesman
will automatically drop his price.

574
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,670
Bad salesmen make me sick.
Hello.

575
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:49,832
Mr.Stone,
do you love your wife?

576
00:43:49,932 --> 00:43:52,550
Hang on. Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

577
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,636
Oh, sure, Mr.Stone.

578
00:43:57,919 --> 00:43:59,719
Go ahead.

579
00:43:59,853 --> 00:44:04,102
Mr.Stone, you love
your wife, don't you?

580
00:44:04,202 --> 00:44:06,379
Sure, I love my wife.

581
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:10,278
Mr.Stone, we demand
a satisfactory explanation...

582
00:44:10,378 --> 00:44:13,035
why you haven't shown
with the money.

583
00:44:13,135 --> 00:44:16,583
Look, pal, you're asking a lot of cash.
I haven't got that kind of money around the house.

584
00:44:16,683 --> 00:44:19,172
It's all tied up
in investments, so, uh, sorry.

585
00:44:19,272 --> 00:44:22,021
Sorry?
What do you mean, sorry?

586
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:24,840
- No can do.
- What?

587
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,943
No deal. You have to take
your business elsewhere.

588
00:44:28,043 --> 00:44:30,532
- What?
- No "cash-ola."

589
00:44:30,632 --> 00:44:36,116
Uh, wh-wh-what
about, uh... less?

590
00:44:37,151 --> 00:44:40,199
You make me sick.
Make me an offer.

591
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:42,589
Uh, bring...

592
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:49,511
Bring... 50,000
in unmarked bills...

593
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:54,215
to the same phone
at noon on Thursday.

594
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:56,708
Thursday. Tomorrow's Thursday.
You mean, tomorrow?

595
00:44:56,808 --> 00:45:00,611
Yes, tomorrow!
Bring 50,000 tomorrow!

596
00:45:00,711 --> 00:45:02,951
And if I don't?

597
00:45:03,051 --> 00:45:05,998
Then the next time you see
your wife, pal, will be in the morgue.

598
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:19,460
Mr.Stone,
I have bad news.

599
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,383
We think we've found
your wife.

600
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:25,553
We'll need you to come with us
to identify the body.

601
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,130
That's not her.

602
00:45:48,895 --> 00:45:50,149
There must be some mistake.

603
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:52,555
We want the woman who was
brought in this morning.

604
00:45:53,114 --> 00:45:57,334
Oh, Jane Doe 56?
She's in the next room.

605
00:46:08,505 --> 00:46:12,916
It looks like her,
a lot like her.

606
00:46:13,644 --> 00:46:16,320
But it's not her.

607
00:46:19,189 --> 00:46:22,355
My Barbara!
She's alive!

608
00:46:30,899 --> 00:46:33,314
~ <i>You see her sittin' with</i>
<i>her coffee and her paper</i> ~

609
00:46:33,414 --> 00:46:36,991
~ <i>With her high-top sneakers</i>
<i>of Italian design</i> ~

610
00:46:37,091 --> 00:46:40,511
~ <i>With her long, cool stare</i>
<i>she aggravates attention</i> ~

611
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:43,877
~ <i>Makes up her face</i>
<i>while she makes up her mind</i> ~

612
00:46:43,977 --> 00:46:46,975
~ <i>Now you're in trouble</i>
<i>maybe she's an intellectual</i> ~

613
00:46:47,075 --> 00:46:49,861
~ <i>What if she figures out</i>
<i>you're not very smart</i> ~

614
00:46:49,961 --> 00:46:52,642
~ <i>Or maybe she's the quiet type</i>
<i>who's into heavy metal</i> ~

615
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:56,641
~ <i>You've got to get it settled</i>
<i>'cause she's breakin' your heart</i> ~

616
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:58,051
~ <i>Don't try</i>
<i>to put on an act</i> ~

617
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:03,072
~ <i>You can't do that</i>
<i>to a modern woman</i> ~

618
00:47:03,172 --> 00:47:04,831
~ <i>And you're an</i>
<i>old-fashioned man</i> ~

619
00:47:04,931 --> 00:47:09,473
~ <i>She understands</i>
<i>the things you're doin'</i> ~

620
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:13,556
~ <i>She's a modern woman</i> ~

621
00:47:25,649 --> 00:47:28,718
~ <i>She's a modern woman</i> ~

622
00:47:30,482 --> 00:47:33,868
~ <i>She's a modern woman</i> ~

623
00:47:40,312 --> 00:47:41,312
More!

624
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,541
Yes?

625
00:47:57,859 --> 00:48:02,062
Sir, there's someone on the phone.
They say they sent you that tape.

626
00:48:03,031 --> 00:48:06,023
Put 'em through,
please.

627
00:48:07,826 --> 00:48:09,026
Hello.

628
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:12,667
Hello. Is this
Chief Benton?

629
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:14,767
Uh, y-yes.

630
00:48:15,169 --> 00:48:17,629
I'm the one who
sent you the tape.

631
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:19,873
Have you had
a look at it yet?

632
00:48:19,973 --> 00:48:22,463
Yes, I just saw it.

633
00:48:22,563 --> 00:48:25,762
- So, what do you think?
- Well, obviously...

634
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:28,543
it's very upsetting.

635
00:48:28,643 --> 00:48:31,228
- This whole thing's making me ill.
- I agree.

636
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:35,040
That poor woman, she had
to go through a living hell.

637
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,426
- I'd rather die a quick death.
- All right! All right!

638
00:48:38,526 --> 00:48:40,348
What do you want
from me?

639
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:44,765
Well, arresting Sam Stone
would be a good start.

640
00:48:44,865 --> 00:48:47,867
You want me to
arrest Sam Stone?

641
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:51,737
Any special reason why
I should arrest him?

642
00:48:51,837 --> 00:48:55,549
- For murdering his wife!
- Murder?

643
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:59,198
Well, uh,
all right, okay.

644
00:48:59,298 --> 00:49:02,559
You know, it's not gonna be easy.
I'll need evidence.

645
00:49:02,659 --> 00:49:06,937
That tape isn't enough
to convince you? Jesus!

646
00:49:07,037 --> 00:49:10,145
Think of the publicity
you'll get.

647
00:49:10,245 --> 00:49:13,022
All right, all right.
I'm convinced.

648
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:16,174
- I'll have Sam Stone arrested.
- Thank you.

649
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,485
Sam Stone?

650
00:49:34,578 --> 00:49:37,855
- Chief Benton.
- The investigation has taken a new direction.

651
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:40,958
We've reason to believe
Stone may have murdered his wife.

652
00:49:41,058 --> 00:49:43,547
- Mr.Stone? Oh, no.
- You heard me.

653
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:48,167
- I want this placed combed until
something is found. Got it? - Yes, sir.

654
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:53,952
Muffy,
there you are.

655
00:49:54,052 --> 00:49:55,052
Ahh.

656
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:59,001
Where have you been,
huh? Good girl.

657
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:02,617
Ah, yeah, the big dog
won't hurt you, huh?

658
00:50:02,717 --> 00:50:05,707
He's just a big...

659
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:26,904
Chief Benton!

660
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:29,402
- What is it?
- I found this in the backyard.

661
00:50:29,502 --> 00:50:31,962
Chloroform.
And Officer Williams found snapshots...

662
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,106
of Mr.Stone
and another woman.

663
00:50:34,206 --> 00:50:35,606
Really?

664
00:50:48,335 --> 00:50:49,935
Jackpot!

665
00:50:59,402 --> 00:51:01,946
Mr.Kessler?
Ken Kessler?

666
00:51:02,046 --> 00:51:04,535
- Yes?
- We're police officers.

667
00:51:04,635 --> 00:51:06,678
I'm Lt.Bender.
This is Lt.Walters.

668
00:51:06,778 --> 00:51:08,793
May we have a word
with you, please?

669
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:11,641
Oh, sure.
Uh...

670
00:51:11,741 --> 00:51:15,139
Come upstairs.
We can talk in the salesmen's office.

671
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,479
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

672
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:30,069
Mr.Kessler,
over a week ago...

673
00:51:30,169 --> 00:51:33,588
a lady named Barbara Stone
was kidnapped from her Bel Air home.

674
00:51:33,688 --> 00:51:37,491
- Are you familiar with the case?
- Yeah, I read about it.

675
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:42,804
We believe the vehicle the kidnappers
used left a tire print in her driveway.

676
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:46,324
We took a mold of that print, had our lab analyze
it, and the results were rather interesting.

677
00:51:46,424 --> 00:51:50,107
These are
the prints of the kidnapper's car,

678
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,704
and these are the prints
of your car.

679
00:51:55,504 --> 00:51:57,784
Is there a phone
I can use?

680
00:51:57,884 --> 00:52:02,025
Uh, sure,
it's right over there on the desk.

681
00:52:08,527 --> 00:52:10,774
Amazing similarity!

682
00:52:10,874 --> 00:52:12,950
Would you excuse me
for a second?

683
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:17,408
I've got to go to the bathroom.
I've got a touch of the stomach flu.

684
00:52:18,443 --> 00:52:20,368
Sure, go right ahead.

685
00:52:20,468 --> 00:52:25,111
Chloroform? What
about fingerprints?

686
00:52:25,211 --> 00:52:28,062
Bingo!
We have a winner.

687
00:52:33,164 --> 00:52:36,758
You won't believe this.
They found evidence implicating Stone.

688
00:52:36,858 --> 00:52:40,474
- Stone? You're kidding?
- Chloroform and fingerprints.

689
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,804
I'll be damned.
Let's get out of here.

690
00:52:42,904 --> 00:52:45,343
- Where's Kessler?
- In the john.

691
00:52:51,213 --> 00:52:53,447
Stomach flu.

692
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,278
Mr.Kessler?

693
00:52:56,378 --> 00:52:58,614
I'll b-be
right out.

694
00:52:58,714 --> 00:53:01,428
Don't bother, sir.
Thank you for your help.

695
00:53:01,528 --> 00:53:03,373
We'll just show
ourselves out.

696
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:25,135
- Hello.
- All right, Mr.Stone.

697
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,436
We came very close
to killing your wife,

698
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:31,282
but she begged us repeatedly
for just one more chance.

699
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:34,159
So in the spirit of
compassion and mercy,

700
00:53:34,259 --> 00:53:36,715
we decided not to kill her
just yet.

701
00:53:36,815 --> 00:53:39,117
Compassion and mercy?

702
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:42,224
What the hell's going on over there?
I thought you people were ruthless!

703
00:53:42,324 --> 00:53:46,828
- We are, Mr.Stone.
- Then what's this phone call about?

704
00:53:46,928 --> 00:53:48,971
We called to make you
an offer,

705
00:53:49,071 --> 00:53:52,011
- an offer even you can't refuse.
- Oh?

706
00:53:52,111 --> 00:53:54,797
Yeah.
10,000.

707
00:53:54,897 --> 00:53:56,907
Fat chance!

708
00:53:57,007 --> 00:54:00,618
Mr.Stone, this is no joke!
We're desperate people.

709
00:54:00,718 --> 00:54:04,138
I believe this is a joke, pal,
and you're it.

710
00:54:04,238 --> 00:54:06,957
The last time we spoke,
you said my wife would be...

711
00:54:07,057 --> 00:54:09,393
in the morgue
if I didn't pay.

712
00:54:09,493 --> 00:54:12,203
Well, I didn't pay and
today I was at the morgue.

713
00:54:12,303 --> 00:54:14,663
She wasn't there.
You lied to me.

714
00:54:14,763 --> 00:54:17,161
- You know what I think of you?
- No.

715
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:20,235
You got no nuts!
What do I have to do?

716
00:54:20,335 --> 00:54:25,080
Put a gun in your hand, aim,
and pull your finger down, you spineless wimp?

717
00:54:26,499 --> 00:54:29,213
I dare you
to kill her!

718
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:33,951
Now that
oughta do it.

719
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,722
Hey, you?
Wanna sell me a stereo?

720
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:42,344
- Yeah, I'll sell you a stereo.
- All right.

721
00:54:42,444 --> 00:54:46,602
I'm lookin' for something real hot.
I don't wanna get ripped off, you know?

722
00:54:46,702 --> 00:54:47,702
Okay.

723
00:54:48,496 --> 00:54:51,786
You're looking for some
real hot speakers, right?

724
00:54:51,886 --> 00:54:54,792
I'm not talking about
something you just listen to.

725
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:59,022
- I'm talking about the kind
of sound you can feel. - Yeah!

726
00:54:59,122 --> 00:55:00,940
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah!

727
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,680
When it comes to great stereo,
you can't beat big speakers.

728
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:09,293
I'm talking about big speakers
with big woofers like this.

729
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:13,455
You can get this. It has a nice little
eight-inch woofer, or this ten-incher.

730
00:55:13,555 --> 00:55:16,648
Over here we have
a nice big 12-inch.

731
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:21,453
But I can tell by the look on your face, man,
you want something even bigger.

732
00:55:21,553 --> 00:55:24,268
- Fuck, yeah!
- "Fuck, yeah" is right.

733
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:27,082
We gotta go to
the big room for this!

734
00:55:27,182 --> 00:55:30,285
The big room!
Check it out, my man.

735
00:55:30,385 --> 00:55:33,834
The flagship of the
entire Dominator line. The MX-10.

736
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:35,847
I have a pair
of these myself.

737
00:55:35,947 --> 00:55:38,854
30 inches of thigh-slappin',
blood-pumpin' nuclear brain damage!

738
00:55:38,954 --> 00:55:42,119
Bitchin'!
Hey, what's the fucking cost?

739
00:55:42,219 --> 00:55:44,910
That's the bitchin'
part about it. It don't matter.

740
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:48,763
If you can't afford it,
fuckin' finance it!

741
00:55:55,361 --> 00:55:57,250
Yeah!
Whoo!

742
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:05,701
So what if it's as big
as a Subaru and costs as much!

743
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:07,782
You'll never have
to trade this in.

744
00:56:07,882 --> 00:56:10,602
This is gonna be with you
for the rest of your life.

745
00:56:10,702 --> 00:56:13,225
And when you die,
they can bury you in it!

746
00:56:13,325 --> 00:56:15,325
I want it!

747
00:56:23,105 --> 00:56:27,308
This guy is okay.
First guy I feel I can really trust.

748
00:56:27,408 --> 00:56:30,755
Wait a minute.
Why don't I show you something else?

749
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:35,109
They're not very big,
but Consumer Stereo rates them a best buy.

750
00:56:35,209 --> 00:56:37,950
The Sentry EV-1s.
And they're not gonna break you.

751
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:40,039
Pick 'em up.
That's it.

752
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:42,853
Kick it out.
Two more.

753
00:56:42,953 --> 00:56:46,790
That's it!
Whew, I'm pooped.

754
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:50,151
- Let's take a break.
- Take a break? Come on, you little wimp!

755
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:52,051
Let's go!

756
00:56:55,903 --> 00:56:58,166
Here's your lunch.

757
00:56:59,672 --> 00:57:02,278
It's fruit salad.
You seem to like that the most,

758
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:05,284
although you still don't eat
as much as you should.

759
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:09,734
My body's become a more efficient machine.
I go farther with less food.

760
00:57:09,834 --> 00:57:12,741
You must be in
pretty good shape by now.

761
00:57:12,841 --> 00:57:15,527
You certainly look good.

762
00:57:15,627 --> 00:57:17,500
You've lost a lot
of weight.

763
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:22,082
Huh?
What?

764
00:57:22,182 --> 00:57:27,428
Oh, yeah, you've lost a lot
of weight, at least 20 pounds.

765
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,528
What?

766
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:31,026
Tw...

767
00:57:32,136 --> 00:57:34,196
Do you have
a scale?

768
00:57:38,138 --> 00:57:41,602
- I don't know how to thank you!
- Thank me?

769
00:57:41,702 --> 00:57:45,539
I've been to...
ten different fat farms in,

770
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:47,653
God, I don't know
how many years.

771
00:57:47,753 --> 00:57:51,911
And I lost a total,
a total of six pounds.

772
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:56,186
I have lost
20 pounds!

773
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:02,403
I wasn't sure,
but...

774
00:58:02,503 --> 00:58:05,103
it felt thin.

775
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:08,929
You wouldn't have a...
never mind.

776
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:11,370
- A... A what?
- No, no, no.

777
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,441
It's very silly.

778
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:15,369
No, what?
Please tell me.

779
00:58:15,469 --> 00:58:19,713
All my life I wanted to have
a slinky little figure...

780
00:58:19,813 --> 00:58:23,875
so I could wear some
Bill Blass or Valentino,

781
00:58:23,975 --> 00:58:28,066
some exotic evening gown
like Christian Dior, Jerry Galanos.

782
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:31,336
Are you kidding me?
You're kidding me, aren't you?

783
00:58:31,436 --> 00:58:36,352
I'm sorry. I know it's ridiculous
to think that somebody of your,

784
00:58:36,452 --> 00:58:41,106
- well, moderate means...
- I'll be right back. Just don't go anywhere.

785
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,715
- Sam Stone?
- Yeah?

786
00:58:51,815 --> 00:58:53,858
Mr.Stone,
you're under arrest.

787
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:56,249
For mixing
cotton with silk?

788
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:04,518
This is absolutely
beautiful!

789
00:59:04,618 --> 00:59:07,366
Whose design is this?
Is this Bill Blass? Albert Nipon?

790
00:59:07,466 --> 00:59:09,763
- Nah, too conventional.
- Halston?

791
00:59:09,863 --> 00:59:12,132
I know who did it.
Oscar de la Renta.

792
00:59:12,232 --> 00:59:15,032
I designed it.

793
00:59:15,397 --> 00:59:18,433
Get outta here!
Really? Wow!

794
00:59:18,533 --> 00:59:21,089
You're a professional.

795
00:59:21,189 --> 00:59:25,952
- Nah. - You are! This is sensational.
Do you have any more?

796
00:59:26,052 --> 00:59:27,052
Wait!

797
00:59:29,622 --> 00:59:33,132
I won't do you no harm
no

798
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:38,754
You've got to be all mine
all mine

799
00:59:38,854 --> 00:59:41,389
Ooh, foxy lady

800
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:46,590
Foxy

801
00:59:50,356 --> 00:59:53,504
So, Sam told you
I was his partner?

802
00:59:53,604 --> 00:59:57,153
No way! He was
just passing the buck.

803
00:59:57,253 --> 00:59:58,853
Oh, God.

804
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,116
So, when do I
get out of here?

805
01:00:02,216 --> 01:00:04,034
As soon as Mr.Stone
pays the ransom.

806
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:08,145
What's the problem?
What is the ransom?

807
01:00:09,268 --> 01:00:11,524
It, it was $500,000.

808
01:00:11,624 --> 01:00:14,209
That shouldn't be
a problem.

809
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:16,832
He complained.

810
01:00:16,932 --> 01:00:19,071
He complained?

811
01:00:19,171 --> 01:00:21,953
And then we dropped our price
to $50,000.

812
01:00:22,053 --> 01:00:25,197
- Yeah?
- He didn't pay.

813
01:00:26,712 --> 01:00:29,184
He didn't pay?

814
01:00:29,284 --> 01:00:31,210
So now what?

815
01:00:33,204 --> 01:00:35,004
So now...

816
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:39,037
we're dropping our price again
to $10,000.

817
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:42,308
Do I understand this
correctly?

818
01:00:42,408 --> 01:00:44,959
I'm being
marked down?

819
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:47,887
What is this?
The bargain basement?

820
01:00:51,512 --> 01:00:56,211
I've been kidnapped
by Kmart!

821
01:00:56,978 --> 01:00:59,596
Don't cry, Barbara.

822
01:01:02,866 --> 01:01:06,280
Hey, check it out.

823
01:01:08,918 --> 01:01:11,869
You sure got
a pretty mouth.

824
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:14,046
All right, Stone,
let's go.

825
01:01:14,146 --> 01:01:17,165
- Hey, was it something I said?
- Yeah.

826
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:21,565
Although this is
a capital crime,

827
01:01:21,665 --> 01:01:24,605
the accused is an upstanding
member of the community,

828
01:01:24,705 --> 01:01:27,578
a responsible and
successful businessman...

829
01:01:27,678 --> 01:01:30,814
and has never before
posed a threat to society.

830
01:01:30,914 --> 01:01:34,113
Bail will be granted
and set at...

831
01:01:34,213 --> 01:01:38,553
- $700,000.
- You want to try for a reduction?

832
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,344
No, pay the ticket
and let's get the hell out of here.

833
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:43,996
That filthy slug!
That screeching little witch!

834
01:01:44,096 --> 01:01:46,489
- That pasty-faced troll!
- The judge?

835
01:01:46,589 --> 01:01:49,330
My wife!
I gotta get her back!

836
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:53,799
- Sandy?
- Kenny?

837
01:01:56,974 --> 01:01:58,971
It's over. Sam isn't going
to pay the ransom.

838
01:01:59,071 --> 01:02:01,531
He couldn't care less.
I'm no criminal.

839
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:04,447
I can't even sell retail...
and that's legal.

840
01:02:04,547 --> 01:02:07,295
- We gotta get packing and get outta here.
- Oh, Kenny!

841
01:02:07,395 --> 01:02:11,836
I've got some very
interesting news for you.

842
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:14,809
I am the new rising star...

843
01:02:14,909 --> 01:02:17,369
- in high fashion!
- Let's get a grip on ourselves.

844
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:21,402
Try to be calm.
We're going down to Mexico for a couple of years.

845
01:02:21,502 --> 01:02:23,838
- We can camp on the beach.
- Does that mean we let Barbara go?

846
01:02:23,938 --> 01:02:26,326
- We're not going to take her with us.
- Good.

847
01:02:26,426 --> 01:02:29,762
- 'Cause I've already let her go.
- What? You let her go?

848
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:36,201
Oh, my God!

849
01:02:36,606 --> 01:02:39,258
- You didn't let her just run right out of here?
- Yeah!

850
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:41,368
- Oh, my God!
- Why not?

851
01:02:41,468 --> 01:02:45,238
She knows where we live.
She'll turn us in. The police will be here.

852
01:02:45,338 --> 01:02:47,770
You don't understand.
She really likes us now.

853
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:50,872
I showed her my gowns.
She loves them.

854
01:02:50,972 --> 01:02:53,596
We're all going into
business together.

855
01:02:53,696 --> 01:02:56,569
- We're gonna open our fall line in Paris.
- She told you this?

856
01:02:56,669 --> 01:02:58,779
Yes. She really,
truly loves me.

857
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:00,731
She can be trusted.
She's changed!

858
01:03:00,831 --> 01:03:03,387
Changed? What'd you do?
Perform an exorcism?

859
01:03:03,487 --> 01:03:06,914
Ken, she lost
nearly 20 pounds.

860
01:03:08,592 --> 01:03:11,719
Well, you just had to be there.
It was a very special moment.

861
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:21,539
I'm surprised
they knocked.

862
01:03:29,297 --> 01:03:31,865
Good afternoon.
We're wondering if you've seen this man.

863
01:03:31,965 --> 01:03:34,967
He was sighted in the area a few
weeks ago and then again this morning.

864
01:03:35,067 --> 01:03:37,758
He's psychotic, extremely
dangerous and violent.

865
01:03:37,858 --> 01:03:40,951
- He's killed half a dozen people.
- I gotta get outta here.

866
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:43,241
My wife,
she's late for work.

867
01:03:44,881 --> 01:03:47,223
Doesn't look familiar.

868
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:51,160
Keep this and give us a call
at this number in case you do see him.

869
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:56,382
Under no circumstances should you try to
subdue him yourself. He's extremely violent.

870
01:03:56,482 --> 01:04:00,139
He looks it. Thank you
very much, Officer.

871
01:04:06,123 --> 01:04:07,323
Sandy?

872
01:04:07,899 --> 01:04:10,388
It's okay.
It's okay!

873
01:04:10,488 --> 01:04:12,778
They're looking
for somebody else.

874
01:04:29,772 --> 01:04:32,486
I'll get the other suitcase
from the basement.

875
01:05:03,462 --> 01:05:04,662
Hello?

876
01:05:05,497 --> 01:05:06,697
Hello?

877
01:05:08,621 --> 01:05:11,221
Anybody home?

878
01:05:11,486 --> 01:05:14,884
Oh, hello. Are you a friend
of Ken and Sandy's?

879
01:05:18,729 --> 01:05:22,098
You...
look like my mother.

880
01:05:22,198 --> 01:05:24,292
I hate my mother.

881
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:33,971
No.

882
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:43,704
You... You look
just like my father.

883
01:05:43,804 --> 01:05:45,639
I hate my father!

884
01:05:48,554 --> 01:05:49,754
Jesus.

885
01:05:49,884 --> 01:05:52,565
What the hell was that?

886
01:05:52,665 --> 01:05:55,385
Honey, don't touch him.

887
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:59,058
Oh, my God.
It's the bedroom killer.

888
01:05:59,158 --> 01:06:01,585
He told me I look
like his mother.

889
01:06:01,685 --> 01:06:03,824
He hates his mother.

890
01:06:03,924 --> 01:06:05,905
He's dead.

891
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:09,458
So, if I look like his mother...

892
01:06:09,558 --> 01:06:12,561
and you look like
his father,

893
01:06:12,661 --> 01:06:15,730
this is what our son
would look like.

894
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:20,338
- Pretty strong argument for birth control.
- What do we do now?

895
01:06:20,438 --> 01:06:24,699
Barbara, what
are you doing here?

896
01:06:32,611 --> 01:06:36,143
I got it! I tell you, I've got it.

897
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:38,070
Listen to this.
All right.

898
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:42,161
Sam arrives on a motorcycle wearing shorts,
no shoes, no shirt, nothing.

899
01:06:42,261 --> 01:06:44,597
Maybe we'll just put him
in a jockstrap.

900
01:06:44,697 --> 01:06:48,303
We send him all over town in
the middle of a hot, sunny day.

901
01:06:48,403 --> 01:06:50,801
Sam burns real easily.
He'll be bright red.

902
01:06:50,901 --> 01:06:53,616
I can't believe
this is happening.

903
01:06:53,716 --> 01:06:56,555
Then he's got to cover himself
with honey and go to a bee farm.

904
01:06:56,655 --> 01:07:01,489
- We make him dance so the bees go
absolutely nuts! - I don't think she really...

905
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:04,558
Then we all watch while
they sting him to death!

906
01:07:04,658 --> 01:07:05,658
Yeah!

907
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:10,159
Don't we want a punishment that'll
keep stinging him the rest of his life?

908
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:13,908
My God, he must've been
seeing this woman for years.

909
01:07:14,008 --> 01:07:17,368
Castrate him!
I want to castrate him.

910
01:07:20,514 --> 01:07:23,700
Wouldn't it be better if we struck
at the core of Sam's being,

911
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,831
- his reason for living?
- What would that be?

912
01:07:26,931 --> 01:07:29,008
His testicles!

913
01:07:29,108 --> 01:07:32,206
Would you know in complete detail
what Sam's total net worth would be,

914
01:07:32,306 --> 01:07:35,759
not just the big stuff, the little stuff too,
down to the last penny?

915
01:07:35,859 --> 01:07:38,641
Yeah...
I think so.

916
01:07:38,741 --> 01:07:43,182
Good. I want you to write it down
in as much detail as you can.

917
01:07:43,282 --> 01:07:46,098
Fire up the stove.
Get the tofu burgers from the freezer.

918
01:07:46,198 --> 01:07:48,066
We're calling Sam.

919
01:08:20,902 --> 01:08:24,266
My tux,
my silk tux.

920
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:28,248
Et tu, Adolph?
Et tu?

921
01:08:40,706 --> 01:08:42,545
- Hello?
- Hi, Sam.

922
01:08:42,645 --> 01:08:46,409
Oh, thank God it's you!
I've been thinking about your last offer.

923
01:08:46,509 --> 01:08:48,754
I think you're right.
I cannot refuse.

924
01:08:48,854 --> 01:08:51,818
$10,000 is fair
and totally acceptable.

925
01:08:51,918 --> 01:08:54,738
She's in bad shape, Sam.
We've been torturing her.

926
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:55,838
Aaah!

927
01:08:58,783 --> 01:09:01,260
- Aaah!
- Don't kill her!

928
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:05,450
We found out your wife is worth
quite a bit more than $10,000.

929
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,431
- What do you mean?
- We changed our minds.

930
01:09:07,531 --> 01:09:09,579
We've upped
the ransom.

931
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,140
- To what?
- We're up to $2 million.

932
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,899
$2 million?

933
01:09:13,999 --> 01:09:17,385
You outta your fucking mind?
Where'd you get an incredible figure like that?

934
01:09:17,485 --> 01:09:19,826
Oh, you'd be surprised at
the quality and quantity...

935
01:09:19,926 --> 01:09:22,394
of information a
lit cigarette can provide.

936
01:09:25,539 --> 01:09:27,560
- What else?
- Shh!

937
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:32,106
Gems! He's got rare gems in the safe.
Oh, Sam, forgive me.

938
01:09:32,206 --> 01:09:36,347
- What kind of gems? How many?
- I don't know.

939
01:09:37,699 --> 01:09:38,699
Aaah!

940
01:09:40,147 --> 01:09:41,147
Aaah!

941
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,635
Four flawless
one-karat diamonds!

942
01:09:46,735 --> 01:09:49,929
The bitch blabbed.

943
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:54,345
Apparently, you got a million-two built
up in equity on Sam's Sportswear,

944
01:09:54,445 --> 01:09:57,035
another 350,000
in your pension plan.

945
01:09:57,135 --> 01:09:59,658
General Dynamics closed
at 75 and 3/4 today,

946
01:09:59,758 --> 01:10:02,348
which brings another
175,000 to the party.

947
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:07,019
45,000 for the Excalibur and now there's
the four one-karat diamonds in the safe.

948
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:10,450
You inhuman slime!

949
01:10:13,183 --> 01:10:15,175
After his release yesterday,

950
01:10:15,275 --> 01:10:17,256
Mr.Stone continued
to deny the charges...

951
01:10:17,356 --> 01:10:21,385
despite what the district attorney's
office insists is overwhelming evidence.

952
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:25,575
Overwhelming evidence is right!
What more do they want?

953
01:10:25,675 --> 01:10:28,412
How could
they let him go?

954
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:33,804
- Hello?
- Hello. It's me again.

955
01:10:33,904 --> 01:10:36,292
I see Sam Stone's
been released.

956
01:10:36,392 --> 01:10:40,330
It's not easy keeping a man in jail
with these liberal courts.

957
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:42,953
A man is innocent
until proven guilty.

958
01:10:43,053 --> 01:10:46,535
Well, how do you think
these courts would feel...

959
01:10:46,635 --> 01:10:51,339
- if I gave that tape to the media?
- Oh, my... God.

960
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:54,183
Yeah!
They'd go crazy for it.

961
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,710
They love to show
sick stuff like that.

962
01:10:56,810 --> 01:11:00,493
It'd probably be on national TV
24 hours a day for weeks!

963
01:11:00,593 --> 01:11:02,598
I bet that'd get
a hell of a reaction.

964
01:11:02,698 --> 01:11:06,501
Please, please
don't do that.

965
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:08,846
Where's your sense
of compassion?

966
01:11:08,946 --> 01:11:11,368
Why do you have
to be so vicious?

967
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:14,950
Vicious?
Have you seen that tape?

968
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:17,707
Come on!
What's the big deal?

969
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:20,709
It's just a lonely man who
wanted a little excitement.

970
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:25,389
That kind of thing happens every day.
Everybody does it!

971
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,877
I don't believe this.

972
01:11:27,977 --> 01:11:31,181
I don't believe
you said that!

973
01:11:31,281 --> 01:11:33,387
Men get the urge.

974
01:11:33,487 --> 01:11:36,326
- We're only human.
- You're sick.

975
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:39,704
Hello? No,
don't hang up on me!

976
01:11:41,181 --> 01:11:45,096
- So, what'd he say?
- Something strange is happening here.

977
01:11:45,196 --> 01:11:48,295
Either the chief
is a complete moron,

978
01:11:48,395 --> 01:11:51,606
and complete
morons are rare,

979
01:11:53,888 --> 01:11:56,259
or he's playing games
with me.

980
01:11:56,359 --> 01:12:00,093
We better find someplace
where we can look at that tape.

981
01:12:05,051 --> 01:12:06,885
- This is perfect.
- It is?

982
01:12:06,985 --> 01:12:08,829
Give me the tape.

983
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:15,238
Okay.

984
01:12:18,774 --> 01:12:20,774
Ho, ho-ho!

985
01:12:24,221 --> 01:12:28,808
- You idiot! This isn't Sam.
- And he isn't killing her.

986
01:12:28,908 --> 01:12:30,788
That's my husband!

987
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:34,950
Barbara really
was kidnapped.

988
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:38,120
She really was kidnapped!
I didn't kill her.

989
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,325
Please believe me.
You gotta be there.

990
01:12:40,425 --> 01:12:43,011
They're coming
this time for sure.

991
01:12:43,111 --> 01:12:47,427
I think the deli's using a different mustard.
The last time it was tangier.

992
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:50,021
Jesus Christ!
I'm pleading for my life...

993
01:12:50,121 --> 01:12:54,279
and you're discussing the inconsistency
of lunch meat condiments!

994
01:12:54,379 --> 01:12:56,406
Haven't you heard
a word I've said?

995
01:13:00,827 --> 01:13:01,827
God!

996
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:08,386
I'm sorry, Mr.Stone,
but since the house is in your wife's name,

997
01:13:08,486 --> 01:13:11,393
as well as her other
15 million in assets,

998
01:13:11,493 --> 01:13:14,946
you're not legally entitled to it
as long as your wife is alive.

999
01:13:15,046 --> 01:13:18,882
However, you've got a million-two
built up in equity in your business,

1000
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:21,985
another 350,000
in your pension plan.

1001
01:13:22,085 --> 01:13:25,667
You'd have no problem
using that as collateral.

1002
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:27,957
All right.
Let's do it!

1003
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:44,742
- Hello?
- Sam?

1004
01:13:44,842 --> 01:13:48,770
Carol! Where the hell have you been?
I've called you 100 times.

1005
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:51,709
Sam, I miss you.
How have you been?

1006
01:13:51,809 --> 01:13:55,296
I'm going crazy over
this kidnapping thing.

1007
01:13:55,396 --> 01:13:58,787
- And the cops won't do a damn thing to help me.
- Why?

1008
01:13:58,887 --> 01:14:01,827
They don't believe me.
They think I made up the kidnapping.

1009
01:14:01,927 --> 01:14:05,159
They won't even show up at the ransom
drop to see if I'm telling the truth!

1010
01:14:05,259 --> 01:14:08,353
You're gonna be all by
yourself? That's terrible.

1011
01:14:08,453 --> 01:14:10,597
How much money
is it?

1012
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:13,598
- $2.2 million.
- Cash?

1013
01:14:13,698 --> 01:14:15,526
Of course it's cash.

1014
01:14:15,626 --> 01:14:18,111
Have you ever heard of
a kidnapper taking a check?

1015
01:14:18,211 --> 01:14:20,484
Where are you going
to give them the money?

1016
01:14:20,584 --> 01:14:23,424
I mean, I, I hope
it isn't dangerous.

1017
01:14:23,524 --> 01:14:26,943
I've gotta go to
a phone booth...

1018
01:14:27,043 --> 01:14:29,966
on Hope Street Plaza.

1019
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,397
- Hello?
- Sam!

1020
01:15:06,497 --> 01:15:10,242
It's so nice to hear your voice.
How's Muffy?

1021
01:15:10,342 --> 01:15:12,285
Listen, Sam,
we don't have much time.

1022
01:15:12,385 --> 01:15:14,591
There's a gun
pointed at my head.

1023
01:15:14,691 --> 01:15:18,657
They're making me give the ransom
instructions in case the police are listening.

1024
01:15:18,757 --> 01:15:22,719
You must make sure there are no police,
otherwise they'll kill me.

1025
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:25,619
Nope. No cops.

1026
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:27,998
Now, have you got
all the money?

1027
01:15:28,098 --> 01:15:32,827
$2.2 million in unmarked,
nonsequential bills?

1028
01:15:32,927 --> 01:15:35,037
You miserable
scum-sucking pig!

1029
01:15:35,137 --> 01:15:40,158
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
They made me say that.

1030
01:15:40,258 --> 01:15:43,294
- Yeah, I got all the money.
- It's there in the briefcase?

1031
01:15:43,394 --> 01:15:46,622
You scumbag!
You lowlife motherfucker!

1032
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:49,662
Oh dear.
They made me say that too.

1033
01:15:49,762 --> 01:15:53,628
- It's in the case, yeah.
- The Rolex too? The gold Rolex?

1034
01:15:53,728 --> 01:15:56,797
Who said anything about the Rolex?
They never mentioned the Rolex.

1035
01:15:56,897 --> 01:15:59,588
They want the Rolex
and your pinkie ring!

1036
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:04,333
Honey, they tortured me with cigars.
I had to tell them everything.

1037
01:16:13,808 --> 01:16:15,680
All right.
What else?

1038
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,957
That's it!
Just wait there.

1039
01:16:29,104 --> 01:16:31,051
Bag, please.

1040
01:16:33,103 --> 01:16:35,663
Come on,
give me the bag!

1041
01:16:39,634 --> 01:16:41,034
Freeze!

1042
01:16:50,221 --> 01:16:54,170
Put the bag down and
put your hands on your head.

1043
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:55,670
Bender!

1044
01:16:55,871 --> 01:16:58,557
They're from the government.
They're here to help you.

1045
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:01,180
I said no police.
Do you know what this means?

1046
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,103
Stay back.

1047
01:17:03,203 --> 01:17:07,802
They touch me and I give
the order to kill! Got it?

1048
01:17:07,902 --> 01:17:10,717
Leave me alone
or she's a dead woman.

1049
01:17:10,817 --> 01:17:15,225
- You want her blood on your hands?
- What do you think?

1050
01:17:15,325 --> 01:17:18,907
- Let's just follow him home.
- Okay, let him go.

1051
01:17:19,007 --> 01:17:20,007
What?

1052
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,136
- What are you doing?
- Gimme it!

1053
01:17:23,236 --> 01:17:25,054
Let go.
Tell him to let go.

1054
01:17:25,154 --> 01:17:28,090
- If he doesn't let go I give the order.
- Go ahead, give the order.

1055
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:30,876
Let go!
She's a dead woman if he doesn't!

1056
01:17:30,976 --> 01:17:32,935
All right,

1057
01:17:35,438 --> 01:17:37,038
drop it.

1058
01:17:38,015 --> 01:17:39,015
Punk.

1059
01:17:46,256 --> 01:17:47,456
Hello?

1060
01:17:49,363 --> 01:17:50,563
Hello?

1061
01:17:51,297 --> 01:17:53,753
This is Lt.Bender.
What are you doing?

1062
01:17:53,853 --> 01:17:57,752
I'm taking my money. You got your man.
The rest is your problem.

1063
01:17:57,852 --> 01:18:02,427
Mr.Stone, you may be guilty of obstructing
justice, aiding and abetting a felon,

1064
01:18:02,527 --> 01:18:04,916
accomplice to kidnapping
and possibly murder.

1065
01:18:05,016 --> 01:18:09,111
My advice to you is
to drop the gun, give back the bag.

1066
01:18:09,211 --> 01:18:13,904
We have 150 officers,
75 cars and two helicopters. He won't get away.

1067
01:18:25,105 --> 01:18:27,898
- That's better.
- Here!

1068
01:18:27,998 --> 01:18:30,200
What are
you doing here?

1069
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:34,069
Tell them to get out
of here! If they don't go, she's dead!

1070
01:18:34,169 --> 01:18:37,786
All right, gentlemen,
clear the street, please.

1071
01:18:37,886 --> 01:18:42,676
You too, Mr.Stone.
Back away.

1072
01:18:42,776 --> 01:18:44,650
That's better.

1073
01:18:52,562 --> 01:18:55,383
You can go now.

1074
01:18:55,483 --> 01:18:58,936
Don't follow me.
Understand?

1075
01:18:59,036 --> 01:19:01,327
We understand.

1076
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,064
- Don't move!
- Who the hell are you?

1077
01:19:07,164 --> 01:19:10,099
What the hell
is going on?

1078
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:12,969
I'm robbing you!

1079
01:19:14,446 --> 01:19:16,246
Stop him!

1080
01:19:17,373 --> 01:19:22,389
- Did you shoot at me?
- No, you moron. There's police all over.

1081
01:19:22,489 --> 01:19:24,345
Hundreds of 'em!

1082
01:19:24,445 --> 01:19:26,963
Do I look
that stupid?

1083
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:29,463
Yes, you do!

1084
01:19:30,813 --> 01:19:33,878
If you shot at me,
where's your gun?

1085
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:36,697
Well, you're too sharp for me!
You got me figured out.

1086
01:19:36,797 --> 01:19:38,987
I don't have one.

1087
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,779
That was
a brand new tire.

1088
01:19:46,151 --> 01:19:48,215
Give me your keys.

1089
01:19:48,315 --> 01:19:50,934
- I don't believe this!
- Give the bag to Bozo,

1090
01:19:51,034 --> 01:19:55,837
drop the gun and
put your hands in the air.

1091
01:19:56,911 --> 01:19:59,349
Who said that?

1092
01:19:59,449 --> 01:20:03,940
This could very well be the stupidest
person on the face of the earth.

1093
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:09,783
Perhaps we should
shoot him.

1094
01:20:09,883 --> 01:20:12,790
It's the police department.

1095
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,290
Really?

1096
01:20:14,841 --> 01:20:19,812
No! We're the National
Rifle Association!

1097
01:20:27,177 --> 01:20:28,577
Christ!

1098
01:20:42,569 --> 01:20:46,530
I'm leaving now.
They said they wouldn't follow me.

1099
01:20:48,007 --> 01:20:50,807
~ <i>Hey</i> ~

1100
01:20:51,063 --> 01:20:54,656
~ <i>Stand up</i> ~

1101
01:20:54,756 --> 01:20:57,290
~ <i>Ruthless People</i> ~

1102
01:20:58,124 --> 01:21:01,663
~ <i>Watch yourself</i> ~

1103
01:21:02,564 --> 01:21:05,324
~ <i>Hey</i> ~

1104
01:21:05,424 --> 01:21:07,455
~ <i>Stand up</i> ~

1105
01:21:08,971 --> 01:21:12,080
~ <i>Ruthless People</i> ~

1106
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,830
~ <i>Ruthless People</i> ~

1107
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:20,433
~ <i>You can have it</i>
<i>if you want it</i> ~

1108
01:21:20,533 --> 01:21:23,665
~ <i>It might take</i>
<i>the rest of your life</i> ~

1109
01:21:23,765 --> 01:21:27,010
~ <i>If you want it</i>
<i>you can have it</i> ~

1110
01:21:36,005 --> 01:21:39,220
~ <i>Ruthless People</i> ~
- They're still following me.

1111
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,255
I should have known.
I knew this wouldn't work.

1112
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:44,866
You can't trust
the police!

1113
01:21:55,943 --> 01:21:59,503
Oh, God.
Oh... boy.

1114
01:21:59,603 --> 01:22:02,656
- He's cornered and he knows it.
- I hope he doesn't hurt anybody.

1115
01:22:24,003 --> 01:22:27,321
I'm not going to jail!
I'm not going to jail!

1116
01:22:30,563 --> 01:22:31,810
Oh, my God!

1117
01:22:33,056 --> 01:22:35,856
Hey, look out!

1118
01:22:37,832 --> 01:22:39,632
Watch it!

1119
01:22:53,896 --> 01:22:57,101
Somebody help! He'll drown!

1120
01:22:57,201 --> 01:22:59,853
- The water's way too cold.
- There's riptides.

1121
01:22:59,953 --> 01:23:02,769
- I've seen sharks.
- Somebody call an ambulance.

1122
01:23:02,869 --> 01:23:04,720
Look there!

1123
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:06,717
That's money!

1124
01:23:14,466 --> 01:23:16,266
My money!

1125
01:23:16,405 --> 01:23:18,974
Let's get the coast guard
and fish him out.

1126
01:23:21,889 --> 01:23:23,886
You can't do that!

1127
01:23:23,986 --> 01:23:26,159
That's not your money!

1128
01:23:26,259 --> 01:23:29,419
That's my money!
Stop 'em!

1129
01:23:29,519 --> 01:23:30,519
Aaah!

1130
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:54,253
The bedroom killer!

1131
01:23:54,353 --> 01:23:56,876
What about the money?

1132
01:23:56,976 --> 01:24:00,045
They recovered a few thousand dollars.
The rest washed away.

1133
01:24:00,145 --> 01:24:03,910
He said if anything
went wrong,

1134
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:06,322
they'd kill Barbara.

1135
01:24:06,422 --> 01:24:09,916
Things couldn't have gone more
wrong than this, could they?

1136
01:24:11,901 --> 01:24:14,586
That means she's dead.

1137
01:24:40,355 --> 01:24:42,376
- Mrs.Stone!
- I'll be damned!

1138
01:24:42,476 --> 01:24:44,361
- Mrs.Stone?
- Yes.

1139
01:24:44,461 --> 01:24:47,147
I'm Lt.Walters.
We're glad to see you're okay.

1140
01:24:47,247 --> 01:24:49,707
I'm sorry to have to ask
you to do this right now,

1141
01:24:49,807 --> 01:24:53,273
but I'm afraid we need you
to identify the body.

1142
01:24:56,802 --> 01:24:59,566
Yes!
That's him!

1143
01:24:59,666 --> 01:25:01,671
Oh, I could
never forget that face.

1144
01:25:01,771 --> 01:25:03,723
What hell
he put me through.

1145
01:25:03,823 --> 01:25:05,963
- You're sure he worked alone?
- Positive.

1146
01:25:06,063 --> 01:25:10,858
- He mentioned a partner. - He was
schizophrenic. He thought he had partners.

1147
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:12,810
Where's Sam?

1148
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:14,699
He's over there,
Mrs.Stone.

1149
01:25:14,799 --> 01:25:17,288
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

1150
01:25:17,388 --> 01:25:19,465
I'd just like to be alone
with my husband.

1151
01:25:19,565 --> 01:25:21,976
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

1152
01:25:23,616 --> 01:25:25,816
Hello, Sam.

1153
01:25:29,178 --> 01:25:30,778
Barbara!

1154
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:34,599
You look terrific!

1155
01:25:34,699 --> 01:25:37,243
You think so?

1156
01:25:38,816 --> 01:25:40,216
I mean,

1157
01:25:40,362 --> 01:25:42,539
- you're so thin.
- Really?

1158
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:45,239
Does it show?

1159
01:25:47,898 --> 01:25:51,563
I mean,
you're beautiful!

1160
01:25:51,663 --> 01:25:55,129
- Oh, Sam!
- Oh, Barbara!

1161
01:25:57,248 --> 01:26:00,233
I hope my marriage
is as strong as theirs after 15 years.

1162
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:02,985
I can't believe we doubted
Stone's affection for his wife.

1163
01:26:03,085 --> 01:26:05,867
We almost blew it. Thank God she's alive.

1164
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:09,732
Ol' buddy, you work,
