1
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:46,668
<i>The drivers are all on the grid now, and</i>
<i>the Monaco Grand Prix is about to start.</i>

2
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,240
<i>There's Scott Stoddard</i>
<i>with his Jordan BRM.</i>

3
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:54,743
<i>And with him now, is Jeff Jordan himself,</i>
<i>talking to this brilliant English driver...</i>

4
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,644
<i>... who's won so many races</i>
<i>in the dark-green BRMs.</i>

5
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:02,186
<i>Even faster than Stoddard in practice,</i>
<i>was the Frenchman, Jean-Pierre Sarti.</i>

6
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:07,190
<i>Twice world champion, an absolute master</i>
<i>of these twisting Monte Carlo streets...</i>

7
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,726
<i>... he's won the Grand Prix here</i>
<i>three times.</i>

8
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:12,693
<i>He drives for the great Italian manufacturer,</i>
<i>Ferrari.</i>

9
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,603
<i>His teammate is the Sicilian, Nino Barlini,</i>
<i>who's also won a place on the front row.</i>

10
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,137
<i>Barlini's the former world champion</i>
<i>motorcyclist...</i>

11
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,375
<i>... who made a very successful switch</i>
<i>to car racing last year...</i>

12
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:28,240
<i>... and is certainly a potential</i>
<i>world champion in Formula 1 racing.</i>

13
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,480
<i>On the second row, is Pete Aron,</i>
<i>the American, now driving for BRM.</i>

14
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,214
<i>Pete hasn't won a Grand Prix since</i>
<i>he left Ferrari three seasons ago.</i>

15
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,054
<i>But in spite of two bad accidents last year,</i>
<i>he's still just as fast as ever.</i>

16
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,061
<i>Yesterday he lapped only a tenth slower</i>
<i>than Scott Stoddard...</i>

17
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,825
<i>... number one driver in the BRM team.</i>

18
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:53,631
Let's try and get the season
off to a good start. Shall we?

19
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:59,301
Drive the car, don't try
to stand it on its bloody ear.

20
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,908
<i>Tim Randolph, another American, driving</i>
<i>a Japanese Yamura, also on the second row.</i>

21
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,986
<i>This team's only been in Formula 1 racing</i>
<i>for two years...</i>

22
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,886
<i>... and so far the car's not been</i>
<i>reliable enough to win a Grand Prix.</i>

23
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,426
<i>But the Japanese have</i>
<i>the most powerful engines of all.</i>

24
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,979
Ten seconds.

25
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,754
Five...

26
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,789
...four...

27
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,092
...three...

28
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,961
...two, one.
Go!

29
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,839
<i>Ste. Devote,</i>
<i>then Sarti in the lead.</i>

30
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,414
<i>From Stoddard, Aron, Hulme,</i>
<i>Anderson and Randolph.</i>

31
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,984
<i>Stoddard's drawing level with Sarti</i>
<i>up the hill. He's going to overtake him.</i>

32
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,146
<i>Now, it's Sarti in the red Ferrari,</i>
<i>number 17 leading...</i>

33
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:54,690
<i>... past the Hotel de Paris</i>
<i>and into the Casino Square.</i>

34
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,380
<i>Along the seafront, at the tobacconist...</i>

35
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:53,177
<i>... it's Sarti's red Ferrari ahead of</i>
<i>Stoddard's green BRM number 12.</i>

36
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,465
<i>As they finish the first lap, it's Sarti first,</i>
<i>Stoddard second, Aron third...</i>

37
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,867
<i>... and fourth now</i>
<i>is Barlini's Ferrari, number 16.</i>

38
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,969
<i>I used to think nothing</i>
<i>could be better than motorbike racing</i>.

39
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:26,208
<i>Three times I'm awarded champion</i>
<i>on my motorbike. I'm happy</i>.

40
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,751
<i>Then I go into one of these...</i>

41
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,652
<i>These cars... You sit in a box</i>, <i>a coffin</i>.
<i>Gasoline all around you</i>.

42
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,825
<i>It is like being inside a bomb</i>.

43
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,759
<i>Crazy</i>.
<i>But, of course, the cars are faster</i>.

44
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,593
<i>And that is the most important thing</i>.

45
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,442
<i>You have to remember that at Monte Carlo,</i>
<i>because of the nature of the circuit</i>...

46
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,877
...<i>you shift gears over 2600 times</i>
<i>during the race</i>.

47
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:01,146
<i>That's an average of once</i>
<i>every three seconds</i>.

48
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,380
<i>No reason to expect gearbox trouble</i>.

49
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:09,187
<i>On the other hand, potential problems</i>
<i>are in the back of your mind all the time</i>.

50
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:13,264
I've driven this course six times before...

51
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,833
...the way I see it, I've only got
three big problems today, and that's:

52
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,995
Two Ferraris starting ahead of me
and my own teammate, Scott Stoddard.

53
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:28,105
<i>Walking the course is just about the last</i>
<i>thing I'd do on the morning of a race</i>.

54
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:33,043
<i>It's become a bit of a thing with me</i>.
<i>I do a lot of thinking</i>...

55
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,846
<i>... collecting my thoughts about how I'll</i>
<i>run the race</i>, <i>all that sort of thing</i>.

56
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:42,517
<i>Of course, it originated with my brother,</i>
<i>Roger. He used to do the same thing</i>.

57
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:47,689
<i>As a matter of fact, before I started racing</i>
<i>I often used walk the course with him</i>.

58
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:50,733
<i>The funny thing about Roger,</i>
<i>you know</i>...

59
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:55,431
...<i>the day he was killed, he hadn't walked</i>
<i>the circuit for some reason or another</i>.

60
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,907
<i>I suppose I'm rather superstitious</i>
<i>about that</i>.

61
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,522
<i>I love the challenge of Monaco</i>.

62
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:16,024
<i>Driving through ordinary streets full out,</i>
<i>is to me what racing is all about</i>.

63
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,755
<i>It's a pity it's the only one</i>
<i>left of its kind</i>.

64
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:24,994
<i>At the end of 10 laps the order is still</i>
<i>Sarti, Stoddard, Aron and Barlini</i>.

65
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,298
<i>Stoddard can't quite squeeze his BRM</i>
<i>past Sarti's Ferrari</i>.

66
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,069
<i>There's very little room to pass</i>
<i>on these narrow Monte Carlo streets</i>.

67
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,179
<i>Barlini and the other Ferraris</i>
<i>can't quite...</i>

68
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,823
- Oh, my darling. You're not ready?
- Ready? For what?

69
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,798
Pat, you've forgotten.

70
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,870
Hugo, the way I feel now...

71
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:05,375
...if I could remember my own name,
I'd consider myself very fortunate.

72
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,805
- What have I forgotten?
- Last night.

73
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,540
I told you I'd be by to take you
to the winner's circle...

74
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,549
...if Scott wins.
- Hugo, there's lots of time.

75
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,414
The dungarees.

76
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:20,956
Hugo, have you ever had ouzo?

77
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,484
I have had everything, my dear.

78
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:29,833
I was with two Greeks last night
and we drank ouzo. A lot of ouzo.

79
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:33,500
And where, may I ask,
was your husband...

80
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:38,075
...while all this Greek
and ouzo business was going on?

81
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:41,972
Where he always is the night before a race:
Trying to sleep.

82
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,548
<i>The danger? Well, of course</i>.

83
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,750
<i>But you are missing</i>
<i>a very important point</i>.

84
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,488
<i>I think, if any of us imagined,</i>
<i>really imagined</i>...

85
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:04,893
...<i>what it would be like to go into a tree</i>
<i>at 150 miles an hour</i>...

86
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:10,139
...<i>we would probably never get</i>
<i>into the cars at all. None of us</i>.

87
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,609
<i>So it has always seemed to me,</i>
<i>that to do something very dangerous</i>...

88
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:20,582
...<i>requires a certain</i>
<i>absence of imagination</i>.

89
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,115
<i>Number 17, the Ferrari of Jean-Pierre Sarti,</i>
<i>is still in front...</i>

90
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:31,023
<i>... but he just cannot get away from</i>
<i>number 12, Scott Stoddard in the BRM.</i>

91
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:35,098
<i>And the second BRM driver, number 11,</i>
<i>Pete Aron, is only three seconds behind...</i>

92
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:39,260
<i>... with Nino Barlini in number 16</i>
<i>Ferrari breathing down his neck.</i>

93
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,608
<i>That's 25 laps gone.</i>
<i>One-quarter of the race distance.</i>

94
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,484
<i>As Sarti and Stoddard fight for the lead,</i>
<i>they're leaving Aron and Barlini behind.</i>

95
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,990
<i>Stoddard's pressing Sarti. The Frenchman's</i>
<i>usually unbeatable at Monaco...</i>

96
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,426
<i>... but today the Englishman is faster</i>
<i>on some parts of the circuit.</i>

97
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,734
<i>Now that Stoddard's out in the lead,</i>
<i>his lap times are faster and faster.</i>

98
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,742
<i>And he's going steadily away from Sarti.</i>

99
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,508
<i>There doesn't seem to be anything</i>
<i>the Ferrari driver can do about it.</i>

100
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:42,822
<i>There's Scott Stoddard completing his</i>
<i>30th lap and increasing his lead over Sarti.</i>

101
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,487
<i>But there's the third man, Barlini,</i>
<i>in his red Ferrari now well-clear of Aron.</i>

102
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,826
<i>And he's just lapping a slower car.</i>

103
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,437
<i>That can be tricky here at Monte Carlo.</i>
<i>It's almost impossible to pass...</i>

104
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:57,234
<i>... unless you can rely on the driver in the</i>
<i>slower car to move over and make room.</i>

105
00:19:56,128 --> 00:20:01,691
<i>That's 32 laps completed and the order is</i>
<i>Stoddard, Sarti, Barlini, Randolph, Aron.</i>

106
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,373
- Get back out there.
- It's sticking in between third and fourth.

107
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,344
It didn't do it in practice.
Do you suppose it could be you?

108
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,178
All right, I'm doing it on purpose.

109
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,912
On purpose or not,
you're breaking her up.

110
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,921
- I didn't build the damn car.
- We can't do anything about it.

111
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,059
- Do the best you can.
- What lap is this?

112
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,888
- Forty-two.
- It's a cinch. I'm halfway home.

113
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,361
You're never halfway home!

114
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,330
<i>Pete Aron's away again.</i>
<i>He's had some sort of gearbox trouble.</i>

115
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:41,202
<i>There's Stoddard now. He'll lap</i>
<i>his BRM teammate, Aron, next time round</i>.

116
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,001
<i>Stoddard's driving a tremendous race</i>.

117
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:48,738
<i>Bet he's broken the lap record again: 129.3.</i>

118
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:00,042
<i>Blimey, they nearly collided</i>
<i>at the Gasometer hairpin. That was close.</i>

119
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,618
<i>Louis Chiron's waving</i>
<i>the blue flag at the American...</i>

120
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:05,881
<i>... which means he ought to move over</i>
<i>and let the faster car through.</i>

121
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,456
Let Scott through!

122
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,097
The bloody idiot.
Sarti's picked up three seconds.

123
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,134
You can't blame Pete
for wanting to race.

124
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:22,637
Not with a teammate!
He has to let him through!

125
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,977
<i>Barlini in second place at the Gasometer</i>
<i>as Sarti completes 50 laps...</i>

126
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:50,110
...<i>half distance in the lead.</i>
- That's my driver. Let go. Let me through.

127
00:24:57,228 --> 00:25:00,425
- Damn you! Damn you!
- Get these people out of here!

128
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:02,532
- I waved him through.
- Where are the cops?

129
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,999
- You're a bloody liar.
- Please, Jeff.

130
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,570
I told you to take it easy with him.

131
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,674
- Apart from being a bloody coward!
- Jeff, don't.

132
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,642
- Shut up! You're a liar!
- Now, get these people out of here!

133
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,542
Shut up.
Look, you're through with me!

134
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,741
Now, just get out of my sight
as quick as you can!

135
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,313
Something's happened.
There has been an accident.

136
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:28,624
That's what they come for:
See someone get killed.

137
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,710
- How did it happen?
- A bloody lot you care.

138
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,479
- Don't say that. Don't speak to me like...
- Mrs. Stoddard.

139
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,853
You can stay here if you want.

140
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,458
It will be some time in surgery.

141
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,337
You've got what you want now.

142
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,075
He's finished with driving.

143
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:26,612
Maybe we'll have some peace
in our lives now.

144
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,049
You think so?

145
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:37,183
How I didn't spin out
is a miracle of skill and daring.

146
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,686
What do you think of this man?

147
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,325
In the middle of the race
he decided to take a swim.

148
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,424
It cost me two seconds.

149
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,208
From the manager.

150
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,407
Hey, Jean-Pierre.

151
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:04,909
You should fix that.
I have something in my room.

152
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,982
I just talked to the hospital.

153
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,590
- He's alive?
- Yeah.

154
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,355
Jordan says I was blocking.

155
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,125
Said I didn't give him a signal to pass.

156
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:25,001
- Did you?
- Of course I did.

157
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:28,468
The gearbox froze coming out of the tunnel
and I waved him through.

158
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,302
Got on the brakes, locked up,
and threw me in front of him.

159
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,808
Next thing I knew,
I was in the Mediterranean.

160
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,946
What are you going to do now?

161
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,756
I don't know. Gotta get a ride for the rest
of the season. I don't know where.

162
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,183
Pete?

163
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,391
Do you ever get tired?

164
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,327
Of the driving?

165
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,932
No.

166
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:59,726
Lately, I sometimes get very tired.

167
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,434
You know what I mean?
Very tired.

168
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,088
All right, unhook it.

169
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,436
Jeff is wrong, isn't he, Scott?

170
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,131
He says you're finished.

171
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:48,107
But you're not finished, are you?

172
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,879
I know, Scott.

173
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,577
Better than Jeff, better than anyone.

174
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,750
If I told them you'd drive again,
they'd think I was crazy.

175
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,323
They'll think you're crazy
when you tell them.

176
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,665
But you will, won't you, Scott?

177
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,936
You're in pieces now,
but it won't change anything for you.

178
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:21,510
You'll pull yourself together
and get back in the car somehow.

179
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,811
And for what?

180
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:29,848
To be better than Roger.

181
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:34,182
To compete against a dead man.

182
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:39,463
They don't know anything about that,
do they, Scott?

183
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,564
Not like I know.

184
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:48,128
They don't know it wasn't Pete Aron
in that car today...

185
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,797
...it was Roger you were trying to beat.

186
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,008
Roger's in every car you try to pass.

187
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,516
Well...

188
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,146
...this time, I'm the one that's finished.

189
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,451
No more for me, Scott.

190
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,327
I won't be there next time.

191
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,496
No more for me.

192
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:41,882
Please.

193
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,626
- Madame. Madame.
- Let me through.

194
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,100
Will he drive again?

195
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,600
Leave it.

196
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,602
Come on, will he be flown back to London?

197
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:44,852
Leave it.

198
00:33:49,493 --> 00:33:51,358
I don't need your help.

199
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,663
You bastard.

200
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,345
- Agreement. Really.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,785
Then we can accuse Aron
of being ungentlemanly.

202
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,686
But not of breaking the rules.

203
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:25,355
- Oh, excuse me.
- I still don't agree.

204
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:28,828
At last. I began to think
you were not coming.

205
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,490
I'm afraid I got lost.

206
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,193
You need only have followed the crowd.

207
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,895
I wish I had known.

208
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:38,064
I've only myself to blame.
I invited them all.

209
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,107
First, a drink.

210
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,873
And then I will introduce you to some
people who will be able to help you.

211
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:48,382
Of course, you must tell me more about
the sort of things you'll be doing.

212
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,630
All in a day's work, Hugo.

213
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:12,765
This is work, huh?
It looks so easy.

214
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:24,154
I'd like you to meet
Miss Louise Frederickson.

215
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,313
This is Jean-Pierre Sarti.

216
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,617
Jean-Pierre, it was a wonderful race.
Fantastic.

217
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,522
Thank you. Thank you very much.

218
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,185
She...

219
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:37,929
She's an American journalist,
so be careful what you say, huh?

220
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,832
Would you believe it?
Once, a boy off the streets...

221
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,973
...and now he speaks to kings.

222
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,473
Anyone can speak to kings, Hugo.
But will they speak back?

223
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,442
But if they do, what will they say?

224
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,511
Oh, you see must see my museum.

225
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,775
- Something that might interest you.
- Museum?

226
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,213
- Yes. It's a...
- Jean-Pierre?

227
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,978
- Marvelous, Jean-Pierre.
- Thank you.

228
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,621
- Simply marvelous.
- Thank you.

229
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,952
Your first nine. Hugo, you've got
to come to settle an argument...

230
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,720
...about the 1932 Targa Florio.

231
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:07,022
He's the only one old enough
to have been there.

232
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:10,759
Now, there is a dubious distinction.

233
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,165
Was an excellent race you did today.
Well done.

234
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,135
- Thank you, Bob. Thank you very much.
- Very good.

235
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,474
Suppose I show you the museum?

236
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,870
Obviously, if I don't escape from here,
we'll never get past "hello."

237
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,206
Come to think of it,
we haven't even managed that yet.

238
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:28,248
Now...

239
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,816
...hello.
- Hello.

240
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,429
- What did she mean, "your first nine"?
- Points.

241
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,157
Toward the Drivers' World Championship.

242
00:36:50,674 --> 00:36:53,268
Have you known Hugo very long?

243
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,143
Since yesterday.

244
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:57,678
Someone in New York
gave me his name.

245
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,907
He's offered me his influence.

246
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,052
Which I gather is quite extensive.

247
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,710
Influence? For what?

248
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,551
Well, I work for an
American fashion magazine.

249
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,784
We're going to do
an issue around racing cars.

250
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,691
Yes! Now, I have it.

251
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:18,328
Of course.
Louise Frederickson.

252
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:22,833
You once did an article about my wife,
Monique Delvaux.

253
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,541
"One of the 27 best-dressed
business women in the world."

254
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,405
Something like that.

255
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:30,546
Only 10.

256
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,682
You were away at the time, as I recall.

257
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,147
Yes. "While..."

258
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,050
"While her husband is off
racing motor cars...

259
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:43,922
...this busy woman executive
spends long evenings in her office...

260
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,690
...administering the complex affairs
of the Delvaux Motor Company."

261
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,697
I remember that part quite well.

262
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,431
It had about it the slight hint
of feminine prejudice...

263
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,734
...toward the footloose male.

264
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,004
It wasn't meant to sound that way.

265
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,113
Is your wife here tonight?

266
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:09,216
She never comes to the races.

267
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,967
Charming, isn't it?

268
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,471
I can use this.

269
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,475
It's interesting.

270
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,353
Do you like motor racing?

271
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:50,689
I don't know.
I had never seen a race before today.

272
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:57,024
- What are these?
- Autographs.

273
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,734
People in motor racing.

274
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,901
Where are you?

275
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,604
Over there somewhere.

276
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:20,013
Are you going
to the palace party tonight?

277
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,049
I wasn't invited.

278
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,187
I invite you.

279
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,197
There are a lot of parties tonight,
aren't there?

280
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,000
Yes.

281
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:35,194
- Is that the usual thing after a race?
- Of course.

282
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:36,964
And I can assure you...

283
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,974
...that if you don't come
to the palace party tonight with me...

284
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,475
...you will be missed.

285
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,142
And this man Stoddard,
will he be missed too?

286
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,887
I don't understand.

287
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,516
- Do you know Stoddard?
- No.

288
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:57,991
But I find it difficult to understand
how this sort of thing can be going on.

289
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,027
The celebrations.

290
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,996
When a man lies in a hospital,
possibly crippled for life.

291
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,241
If he were dead,
it would be the same.

292
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,413
More subdued perhaps, but the same.

293
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,210
And apparently it doesn't
affect you at all. None of you.

294
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,913
I'm sorry.

295
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,083
I guess that was all very rude of me.

296
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:36,098
Before you leave,
I want to tell you something.

297
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,531
Not about the others.

298
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,533
But about myself.

299
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:44,734
I used to go to pieces.

300
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,175
I'd see an accident like that
and feel so weak inside...

301
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,108
...that I wanted to quit.

302
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,249
To stop the car and walk away.

303
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,180
I could hardly make myself go past it.

304
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,987
But I'm older now.

305
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:04,924
When I see something really horrible,
I put my foot down.

306
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,460
Hard.

307
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,760
Because I know
that everyone else is lifting his.

308
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:14,403
What a terrible way to win.

309
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:18,664
No, there is no terrible way to win.

310
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:20,332
There is only winning.

311
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,440
Hello, Nino.

312
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,922
Nino!

313
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,679
Nino!

314
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,346
Dance?

315
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,514
I don't dance.

316
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,227
Have a drink with me.

317
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,228
I don't drink.

318
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:25,733
- Smoke?
- I don't smoke.

319
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,273
What do you do?

320
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,935
So you let Stoddard lap you.

321
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:09,977
You're still getting yourself
into hopeless situations.

322
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,918
It wasn't hopeless to begin with,
it just turned out that way.

323
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:16,849
There's a difference.

324
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:22,322
But you didn't come all the way to Modena,
to talk about Scott Stoddard. Did you?

325
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,158
I wanna drive for you again,
Signor Manetta.

326
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:35,336
Aron, your last season with me...

327
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,499
...you did nothing but tell me
what was wrong with our cars.

328
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:44,340
Then you left us, to follow hopes
that lasted a season.

329
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,848
Then to Jordan,
now back to me.

330
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,542
You confuse me, Aron.

331
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,451
And I don't like men
who confuse me driving my cars.

332
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:59,262
I left you because I didn't want
to become second driver to Sarti.

333
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:01,192
A position you put me in.

334
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,957
And now?

335
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,430
I need a ride.

336
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,362
I won a lot of races for you.

337
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:12,737
Of course you did.
Before you became reckless.

338
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,741
- I want to be champion.
- Everyone wants to be a champion, Aron.

339
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,382
There is no distinction in that.

340
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,051
I can be.

341
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,649
At what cost? And to whom?

342
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,620
All right.

343
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,728
I'll drive for you for less than
I was getting on my old contract.

344
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,454
I'll pay my own expenses.

345
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:37,725
You take the starting money.
I'll just take my share of the prizes.

346
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:41,127
I'm not talking about money, Aron.

347
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,871
Of course, I would not appreciate
your doing to me...

348
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,907
...what you did to Jordan at Monaco.

349
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,979
To have two cars wiped out,
at a cost of $ 100,000 apiece...

350
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:54,276
...is an unhappy experience.

351
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,282
But I could afford that.

352
00:45:56,453 --> 00:46:00,583
I could not be in this business
if I weren't able to afford that.

353
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:05,854
It's one of the risks I take
every time a car leaves the starting grid.

354
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:09,160
But what is a greater risk, Aron...

355
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:14,669
...what means far more to me
than anything else is a good name.

356
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:20,474
Our reputation represents desire
for perfection of the highest quality.

357
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,272
I gamble that reputation gladly.

358
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:27,315
Because I have
absolute faith in every car...

359
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,078
...that leaves this factory.

360
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,853
But I will not risk it in a driver...

361
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,620
...in whom I cannot have an equal faith.

362
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:46,026
There are fewer than 30 men in the world,
qualified to drive Formula 1.

363
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:49,763
A mere half-dozen, perhaps, to win.

364
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:54,937
At this moment, I'm inclined to think
you're not one of them.

365
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,703
Tough luck, Scott.

366
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,439
- Hello. How are you? All right?
- Jeff, how are you?

367
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:30,444
Is it true that doctors strongly advise
against moving Scott?

368
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:34,516
No, the decision to come home was Scott's.
He felt with English doctors he'd probably...

369
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,984
What about next season?
Scott, will you be ready to drive?

370
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:40,445
He's ready to drive now.

371
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,855
I just don't happen to have
a car for him at the moment.

372
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:47,421
All right, let's get him in.

373
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,332
- Hey, Jeff.
- Yeah?

374
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:56,504
What about these rumors of a divorce
between Scott and Pat?

375
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,903
- Absolute nonsense.
- I know, but we've heard...

376
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:03,012
Now, look, Mrs. Stoddard is taking
an enforced vacation under doctor's orders.

377
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,172
You know neither heaven nor earth
could keep her from Scott's side.

378
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:08,214
- She's just on this holiday.
- All right.

379
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,444
- Okay. Thanks.
- Good luck.

380
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,824
- Where is she?
- Forget her.

381
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,160
- Where is she, Jeff?
- I don't know.

382
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,056
I want her back, you know.

383
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,499
You're a fool, then.

384
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,695
Jeff, you've never understood her.

385
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:32,933
I know you think she's frivolous,
incapable of any kind of understanding.

386
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,977
But you're wrong.
It's just that she hates what I do.

387
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:41,282
I think she still loves me, you know.
Hard as that may be for you to understand.

388
00:48:42,285 --> 00:48:45,311
Trouble is, she's got to persuade
herself that she doesn't.

389
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,186
I worry about what she might do...

390
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,791
...trying to convince herself of that.

391
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:58,599
- Fine. Thank you, David. Where's Tina?
- Tina! Tina!

392
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,293
Tina?

393
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:12,045
Hey, Pat? In the car.

394
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,183
- How am I doing?
- You're doing beautifully.

395
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:17,946
- I look all right?
- You look fine. Now, just stop worrying.

396
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:22,456
- Oh, good morning.
- Good morning.

397
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,195
I expected you to be back
in America by now.

398
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:30,993
Oh, no. We'll be doing this
the entire season. I thought you knew.

399
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,499
No, no.

400
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,603
Does Guido know about all this?

401
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,035
Of course.
Arrangements were made.

402
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,005
Well, I can't say I'm not properly dressed
for the occasion.

403
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,509
I should be wearing
something fashionable.

404
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:46,706
Well, your driver's suit isn't bad.
Maybe you could start a new style.

405
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:50,819
Spun-glass, form-fitting,
waterproof, flameproof.

406
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,822
What's Pat doing here?

407
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:56,753
Oh, she asked for a job
and I was able to give her one.

408
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,918
She's very good.

409
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,464
- Hello, Pat.
- Hello, Jean-Pierre.

410
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:06,466
You're looking very chic in my car.

411
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,469
- How's Scott?
- I don't know.

412
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,411
- Arrangements were made.
- They told me arrangements were made.

413
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,948
Guido.
They mean no harm.

414
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,763
<i>So far, Sarti has</i>
<i>the fastest practice time</i>.

415
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:11,662
<i>If nobody goes any faster this afternoon,</i>
<i>the Ferrari will be in pole position...</i>

416
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,462
<i>... for tomorrow's French Grand Prix.</i>

417
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:16,606
<i>Sarti's time was 3 minutes,</i>
<i>11. 1 seconds.</i>

418
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,968
<i>95. 1 miles an hour.</i>

419
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,939
<i>This Clermont Ferrand circuit is just...</i>

420
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:24,046
- How do you feel?
- Like an idiot.

421
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:28,048
Don't look so glum.
It's an honorable profession.

422
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:31,445
- You'd rather be dogcatcher or something?
- Or something.

423
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:37,689
- He's doing well.
- He could do better.

424
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,920
A slave driver, this one.

425
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:42,121
This looks very complicated.

426
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:43,766
At first glance.

427
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:48,098
It's only a different way to tell time.
More precise.

428
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:51,564
Well, I'm afraid I don't understand
any of this.

429
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,935
- Not any of it?
- No.

430
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,273
I mean, for one thing, it looks to me
as though the spectators...

431
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,881
...can't really see very much of the race.

432
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,041
True enough, I suppose.

433
00:52:02,218 --> 00:52:04,709
Jean-Pierre, <i>andiamo</i>!

434
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,546
And the risks you take.
Aren't they ridiculous?

435
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,522
I might understand it if you
made a great deal of money...

436
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,559
...but I'm told you don't at all.

437
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:17,132
Some of us do. But money
is not an important part of it.

438
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,064
- Then what is?
- Many things.

439
00:52:20,236 --> 00:52:22,261
It's marvelous to go very fast.

440
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,106
Why is it so marvelous to go very fast?

441
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,537
Answer that one, Lisa.

442
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,710
- Hello, Chris.
- Hi, Pete.

443
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:38,243
- Jean-Pierre. How are you?
- Hey!

444
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,824
- How are you, Pete?
- All right.

445
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,622
Hey, Nino.

446
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:49,321
The cars aren't good enough
for him anymore.

447
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,162
Interview me first, Pete.
I have had a fascinating life.

448
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,963
- I might as well.
- World should know.

449
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,800
I wouldn't want people
to think I was unemployed.

450
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,569
I was a born a poor boy
in Cerda, Sicily. Nothing to eat.

451
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,837
- Not a crumb of bread in the house.
- I guess Manetta told you...

452
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,313
...I came looking for a job.
- Every year, I would...

453
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,850
Well, I think he should've found you one.

454
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,320
Cerda is right on the course
of the great Targa Florio race.

455
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:18,359
- Knock it off, will you?
- Knock it off? What's that?

456
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:22,965
It means: You would be
well-advised to cease.

457
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,298
Yes.

458
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,131
"Knock it off."
I like that.

459
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,243
<i>We're pleased to announce the arrival...</i>

460
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,906
<i>... of the famous Japanese industrialist,</i>
<i>Mr. Izo Yamura.</i>

461
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:44,417
<i>He's been racing Formula 1 cars</i>
<i>for more than two years now.</i>

462
00:53:44,587 --> 00:53:46,987
<i>But this is his first visit</i>
<i>to a Grand Prix circuit.</i>

463
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:49,455
<i>We're delighted to welcome him</i>
<i>to Clermont Ferrand.</i>

464
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:51,719
This might be something to get, Pete.

465
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,290
Well, you care to come watch my debut?

466
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,777
- Hello, Tim.
- Hello, Pete.

467
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,351
- Hello again.
- Pete, how are you?

468
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:21,615
Mr. Yamura? My name is Pete Aron.

469
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,704
Mr. Yamura wishes you to know that he,
of course, recognizes from photographs...

470
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,601
...the well-known Mr. Aron.

471
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,334
Although he was at first
somewhat confused...

472
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,808
...to find you in your present occupation.

473
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:48,476
He also offers his regrets in regard
to your unfortunate accident at Monaco.

474
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:51,619
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.

475
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:56,224
I was wondering if Mr. Yamura
would consent to doing an interview?

476
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,797
Mr. Yamura regrets
he does not give interviews.

477
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:10,165
Well, I'm sorry. Thank you,
thank you very much, sir.

478
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,268
- See you, Tim.
- See you later, Pete.

479
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,511
Well, I'm off to a flying start.

480
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:19,876
- Well, there's always Nino.
- Yeah. There's always Nino.

481
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:22,074
He was born in Cerda, Sicily, you know.

482
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:23,844
Not a crumb of bread in the house.

483
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,751
But he always knew that someday,
someday a poor guy, you know.

484
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,782
<i>Of course there's no trouble</i>
<i>between Scott and me.</i>

485
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,155
<i>I've simply resumed my career.</i>

486
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:36,122
<i>Well, one of my careers.</i>

487
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,392
<i>Mostly at Scott's urging,</i>
<i>I might add.</i>

488
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,763
<i>It would hardly be a proper motor</i>
<i>racing season...</i>

489
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:44,202
<i>... without the Stoddard name connected</i>
<i>to it in some way, would it, Pat?</i>

490
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:47,866
<i>Considering what the Stoddards have been</i>
<i>to the sport in the past few years.</i>

491
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:51,878
<i>Needless to say, I'm present in a far more</i>
<i>humble capacity than Scott would be.</i>

492
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:55,943
<i>I'm delighted to be able to represent</i>
<i>the name for the rest of this season.</i>

493
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,950
<i>Pat, when did you last talk to Scott?</i>

494
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:01,248
<i>Can you give us some idea</i>
<i>of how he's coming along?</i>

495
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:04,655
<i>Oh, we talk two or three times a day.</i>
<i>He's coming along beautifully.</i>

496
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:08,558
<i>And he wants everyone to know</i>
<i>how very grateful he is for all the hun...</i>

497
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:16,363
That interview concludes
this broadcast from Clemont Ferrand.

498
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,133
Tomorrow at 3:00,
there will be a live transmission...

499
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,834
...of the start of the French Grand Prix.

500
00:56:24,847 --> 00:56:27,145
- Hello, Jean-Pierre.
- Hello.

501
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,615
Hello. Pete.

502
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,210
You were fine.

503
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,851
That was beautiful, Pat.
Really beautiful.

504
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:40,257
Particularly the part about representing
the Stoddard name?

505
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,658
That was especially good.

506
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:45,458
You'll have to be careful, though.

507
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:49,230
If Scott gets a load of that kind of thing,
he's liable to recover very quickly.

508
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:51,270
You'll be out of a career again.

509
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,212
You're very superior, Mr. Aron.

510
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:04,251
For the man to put Scott Stoddard
where he is.

511
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,352
Scott put Scott where he is.

512
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,800
That was a perfectly appalling thing,
what he said to that girl.

513
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:23,871
He may have done it badly,
but he isn't altogether wrong, you know.

514
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:29,235
The Stoddards don't exactly have
what one would call a fairy-tale marriage.

515
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,745
- Well, that's their business, isn't it?
- Not if she chooses...

516
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:36,146
...to discuss it
in front of a television camera.

517
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,250
Now, would you care for some lunch?

518
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:42,152
Nino seems to have enough there
for all of us.

519
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:57,730
That's what comes
of a poverty-stricken childhood.

520
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,841
This girl has died from over-timing.

521
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,203
Enough food. I need the sun.

522
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:05,740
The sun it will be.

523
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,088
Sun, food and sex.

524
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:18,716
It's hard to think of them
10 years from now.

525
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,556
Fat and married.

526
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,426
With five fat children.

527
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,625
Maybe.
Maybe they'll avoid it.

528
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:28,896
The marriage or the fat?

529
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:30,602
Both.

530
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,267
You don't believe in marriage?

531
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,568
It depends on whose marriage it is.

532
00:59:02,004 --> 00:59:05,838
- I apologize for that.
- Why?

533
00:59:06,008 --> 00:59:08,101
Because it was bad manners.

534
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:10,742
What does it matter to you
what I do or don't do?

535
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,307
A girl has to make a living.

536
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:17,010
Last time a girl said that to me,
she was stepping out of her skirt...

537
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:20,713
...and asking for a hundred-dollar bill.
- Making a comparison?

538
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,792
When did you last talk to Scott?

539
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,531
- At Monaco.
- That's sweet.

540
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,995
Why are we being so offensive?

541
00:59:33,669 --> 00:59:35,762
Probably because
we don't like each other.

542
00:59:36,305 --> 00:59:38,273
Speak for yourself.

543
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,253
Now, you see?

544
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:57,587
The object is to put the fly exactly
where you want it to be.

545
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,294
Well, what difference does it make?
It's a big lake.

546
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:03,557
The difference is the art of it.

547
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,964
We could wade out and hit the fish
over the head...

548
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:11,129
...but there would be no art in that,
would there? Now...

549
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,539
Now, is that where you
wanted it to land?

550
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:18,373
Would I admit to anything else?

551
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:22,978
Where was I?

552
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,446
You began racing
because of your marriage.

553
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,322
Yeah.

554
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:32,984
When we got married,
Monique and I...

555
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:38,293
...Delvaux had just started competition
and I began testing cars.

556
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:41,162
The next step, of course, was racing.

557
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:45,096
Delvaux stopped racing some years ago.
But I kept on.

558
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:46,741
Why?

559
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:51,343
Well, actually I think
I've begun to wonder myself.

560
01:00:52,014 --> 01:00:55,040
But I suppose it doesn't really matter.
A man does what he does.

561
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,311
We do what we most want to do,
I suppose.

562
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,887
Now, you try.

563
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:03,355
Here, and here.
Hold it here.

564
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,994
This way. Here.

565
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,991
Where are the fish?

566
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,157
The fire is too high.
We must have a bed of embers.

567
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:16,437
We will have a bed of cold gray ashes
by the time you catch a fish.

568
01:01:16,772 --> 01:01:19,969
Have faith, Nino.
I tell you, there are fish.

569
01:01:20,409 --> 01:01:23,537
Now, very gently.
Come on. Now.

570
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,010
- Very good.
- There.

571
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,774
Is that a good place for it to be?

572
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:30,885
Doesn't really matter.
It's a big lake.

573
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:39,388
Hey! My stomach refuses to accept
your promises any longer.

574
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,397
If there were some beefsteak,
I would cook you meat...

575
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:47,502
...in the style of the Auvergne.
- An excellent idea.

576
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:51,106
There is no beefsteak.
We will have fish.

577
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:53,799
In the house, hidden behind the cheese...

578
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:56,570
...in the cooler: Beefsteak.

579
01:01:57,246 --> 01:02:01,808
We will save some for you
because there are no fish in this lake.

580
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,649
Go away, Nino!
You are too close!

581
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:12,995
Why aren't you married?

582
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:19,061
Well, it's not a very subtle question, is it?

583
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:22,204
I need all my subtlety for the trout.

584
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,833
How do you know I'm not married?

585
01:02:28,477 --> 01:02:32,607
I have noted the unmarried
woman's brave air of independence...

586
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:35,307
...mingled with vague longing.

587
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,417
Independence, maybe.

588
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,688
Vague longing. I wasn't aware of that.

589
01:02:44,126 --> 01:02:46,993
Something perhaps
only a man would see.

590
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,994
Or imagine.

591
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:55,601
Well, no vague longing, then?

592
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,272
But not too much
independence either, I hope.

593
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,604
Very bad for a woman
to be too independent.

594
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:03,845
Very bad for whom?

595
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,678
I like to be free.

596
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:12,313
I like traveling.

597
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:15,421
I like making my own decisions.

598
01:03:15,891 --> 01:03:18,689
Meeting new people, working.

599
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,531
I like to be free.

600
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:35,804
I was married once.

601
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:39,543
But he was in love
with someone else.

602
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:45,753
You going to win tomorrow?

603
01:03:47,556 --> 01:03:49,080
Probably.

604
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:29,737
Could we declare a truce long enough
for you to buy me a drink?

605
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:31,677
Sure.

606
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,353
I'll have one of those.

607
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:47,256
Well, Sarti did it again.

608
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,564
Yeah, he drove a good race.

609
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:52,392
How do you like your new job?

610
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,499
It's what I've always wanted to do.

611
01:07:57,006 --> 01:08:02,706
You know, I've known you for, what?
Two and a half years.

612
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:05,438
And all I know about you
is that you drive cars.

613
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:08,242
That's all anyone knows
so far as I can tell.

614
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:10,611
You've just written my biography.

615
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:14,047
"The Silent and Secretive Pete Aron."

616
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,384
"Inside Pete Aron."

617
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,387
"What's Pete Aron Really Like?"

618
01:08:19,561 --> 01:08:21,324
It will never sell.

619
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:30,738
Will you give me a lift back to the hotel?

620
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:43,246
I'll never understand
why none of you...

621
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,149
...get this sort of thing out
of your systems on the track.

622
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:48,755
We all drive like maniacs.

623
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:54,325
I've left Scott, you know.

624
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:56,992
Really.

625
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,030
Yes, I know.

626
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:01,495
You've got a great sense of timing.

627
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:06,732
You think I should be at his bedside,
nursing him back to health and vigor?

628
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:10,937
I guess I'm just
an old-fashioned boy at heart.

629
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,240
You don't understand.

630
01:09:13,882 --> 01:09:16,316
I left him because he won't quit.

631
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:19,246
He won't stop racing.
And I couldn't take it anymore.

632
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,150
I couldn't stand it.

633
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,982
You know what he does
the night before a race?

634
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:25,683
He lies in bed and sweats.

635
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,527
But then, you wouldn't know
what that would be like for a woman.

636
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,233
To live with that.

637
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:55,689
Will you go back to America
when you are finished with your click-click?

638
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,655
Yes, of course.

639
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:01,687
You couldn't be persuaded
to remain in Europe?

640
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,295
My life is in America.

641
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,032
What is your life?

642
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:09,732
What is it?

643
01:10:11,573 --> 01:10:14,007
I never thought about that, I suppose.

644
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,974
Well, think about it.

645
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:21,339
Friends...

646
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,883
...work.

647
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:26,477
That's my life.

648
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,987
My friends and my work.

649
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,323
Well, one needs those.

650
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:38,497
But what do you need now?

651
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,259
Nothing.

652
01:10:41,703 --> 01:10:43,193
Liar.

653
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:47,806
Come with me, Louise.

654
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:53,412
- Where?
- To a place I have in Monza.

655
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:56,216
I have to go there to test a new car.

656
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:59,612
There are two weeks before
the Belgium Grand Prix.

657
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:02,619
We could leave tonight after the party.

658
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,315
Come with me.

659
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:09,792
And your wife?

660
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,001
We share nothing
but our business interests.

661
01:11:14,636 --> 01:11:15,625
Nothing.

662
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:20,967
What do you think we would share?

663
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:23,702
More than that.

664
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:27,439
A bed?

665
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:30,580
More than that.

666
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:32,142
With luck.

667
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,384
Luck has nothing to do with it.

668
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:49,494
- Why do you all do that?
- Do what?

669
01:11:49,671 --> 01:11:52,572
Wear your sunglasses on top of your head?

670
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:56,735
- I don't know.
- It looks ridiculous.

671
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,280
I guess you're going to the party tonight.

672
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:06,415
- No. You?
- No.

673
01:12:08,056 --> 01:12:10,183
What are you going to do about dinner?

674
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:14,125
- How many guesses do I get?
- Nine.

675
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:17,196
- Guesses?
- O'clock.

676
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:51,960
Mr. Yamura?

677
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,833
Mr. Yamura, I got your message.

678
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,070
Your message.

679
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:07,013
Yes, I was hoping
it would reach you in time.

680
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:08,747
Well, I thought...

681
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:12,284
Well, you do speak English.

682
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:16,015
Yes, but not for the press.

683
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:18,250
I hope you will forgive me.

684
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,358
That's quite all right.

685
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:24,556
There have been times when I wish I'd been
able to pull something like that myself.

686
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:29,864
I gather, then, that you didn't ask me
here as a reporter?

687
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:33,967
Will you join me in some tea?

688
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:44,981
Some years ago,
when I decided to race cars...

689
01:13:45,153 --> 01:13:49,749
...I tried to buy
the Jordan-BRM Company.

690
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:52,519
Oh, yes. I had heard that.

691
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:55,722
Impatience on my part.

692
01:13:55,897 --> 01:14:01,130
I also manufacture radios
and sewing machines.

693
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:09,371
In order to save time,
I wanted a proven product.

694
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:12,680
That was not to be, however.

695
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:17,308
Racing cars are not merely
another product.

696
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:19,916
They require great attention.

697
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:23,251
If any success is to be hoped for.

698
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:25,258
Than that's why you're here.

699
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:32,923
I have been racing my car
in Formula 1 for two years.

700
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:38,362
And have yet to win my first Grand Prix.

701
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:44,237
I intend to win by whatever means
are open to me.

702
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,245
That's the right attitude.

703
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:50,112
All you have to do is go fast enough
and long enough.

704
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:54,378
And with the best drivers.

705
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:58,718
Do you want a job with me?

706
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:03,020
- Driving?
- Driving, of course.

707
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:05,325
- Who are you dumping?
- Dumping?

708
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,958
Oh, which one of your drivers
are you getting rid of?

709
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,365
Neither one.

710
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,837
I am entering a third car.

711
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:18,344
- That will be expensive.
- Yes.

712
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:22,614
You've got a driver.

713
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:28,747
My racing headquarters
is at Silverstone in England.

714
01:15:29,257 --> 01:15:32,784
- Can you be there next week?
- Yes, sir.

715
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:36,954
We must begin to think about Spa.

716
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:43,836
- Next week, then.
- By the way, you are a terrible broadcaster.

717
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:48,000
Mr. Aron.

718
01:15:48,543 --> 01:15:53,378
If giving you the job
would have meant firing...

719
01:15:53,548 --> 01:15:59,009
...one of the other drivers,
would you still have taken it?

720
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:04,556
Good.

721
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,231
- Is it true what you said about Scott?
- What?

722
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:19,238
About not being able to sleep
the night before a race?

723
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:25,136
A man like that
should be in some other line of work.

724
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,347
I'll bet you sleep like a baby.

725
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,250
I'm divorcing him.

726
01:16:32,587 --> 01:16:34,020
Are you?

727
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,519
Why tell me?

728
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:40,189
Well, because I don't think
you were entirely joking...

729
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:42,762
...when you said you're
an old-fashioned boy at heart.

730
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:46,423
And old-fashioned boys
have old-fashioned scruples.

731
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:50,970
- About what?
- About other people's wives.

732
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,336
I don't follow you.

733
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:55,934
Like hell you don't.

734
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,458
Good night.

735
01:18:01,873 --> 01:18:03,807
- Memo?
- Jean-Pierre.

736
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:09,713
Memo, good to see you.
I would like you to meet Miss Frederickson.

737
01:18:10,548 --> 01:18:12,311
How do you do?

738
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:16,178
Yes, there's luggage in the car.

739
01:18:16,354 --> 01:18:17,582
Rafael?

740
01:18:24,696 --> 01:18:27,028
Come, I'll show you around.

741
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,840
The only member of this club?

742
01:18:38,009 --> 01:18:40,477
The only one
who keeps an apartment here.

743
01:18:40,645 --> 01:18:43,671
In fact, I have the only apartment.

744
01:18:46,918 --> 01:18:51,719
"Jean-Pierre Sarti,
World Champion, 1961."

745
01:18:56,294 --> 01:18:57,989
It's so quiet.

746
01:18:58,163 --> 01:19:00,688
Appreciate it while you can.

747
01:19:00,899 --> 01:19:05,461
At Grand Prix time,
crowds, excitement, noise. Terrible.

748
01:19:17,115 --> 01:19:20,141
- Care to drink?
- No.

749
01:19:29,994 --> 01:19:31,859
Are you very tired?

750
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:33,829
No.

751
01:20:25,149 --> 01:20:29,552
To health, wealth and happiness.

752
01:20:31,122 --> 01:20:33,716
You are very greedy.

753
01:20:35,593 --> 01:20:36,958
No.

754
01:20:38,596 --> 01:20:40,120
Hopeful.

755
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:47,665
There are seven more races.

756
01:20:48,273 --> 01:20:50,104
Yes, seven.

757
01:20:56,147 --> 01:20:57,478
And then?

758
01:20:59,484 --> 01:21:00,815
Do you want to think that far?

759
01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:04,543
No.

760
01:21:05,723 --> 01:21:06,712
Good.

761
01:21:11,029 --> 01:21:13,327
Now I feel marvelous.

762
01:21:14,599 --> 01:21:16,089
Marvelous.

763
01:21:17,769 --> 01:21:19,259
And you?

764
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:23,529
Yes.

765
01:21:44,762 --> 01:21:46,525
Smile for the cameras.

766
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,231
Come.

767
01:22:06,751 --> 01:22:10,687
As you can see,
we work day and night here...

768
01:22:10,855 --> 01:22:12,652
...to get the car ready.

769
01:22:12,824 --> 01:22:14,951
I'll take your word for it.

770
01:22:24,435 --> 01:22:28,599
We must immediately mold
the cockpit for you.

771
01:22:28,773 --> 01:22:30,297
Yes, sir.

772
01:22:40,451 --> 01:22:44,182
All right? Or too long?

773
01:22:57,769 --> 01:23:00,863
- I like what you've done here.
- Thank you.

774
01:23:01,305 --> 01:23:04,706
I was afraid it might have offended.

775
01:23:04,876 --> 01:23:06,673
Offended? How?

776
01:23:06,844 --> 01:23:10,780
My not adapting to your ways.

777
01:23:10,948 --> 01:23:12,472
No, not at all, sir.

778
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:16,814
I promise you, if I'm ever in Japan
and I entertain you for dinner...

779
01:23:16,988 --> 01:23:18,683
...you'll get a fork.

780
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:20,653
Fair enough.

781
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,094
Right after the war...

782
01:23:24,262 --> 01:23:30,030
...my house in Tokyo was used
by an American general and his family.

783
01:23:31,235 --> 01:23:34,363
When it was returned to me...

784
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:38,339
...it had flowered wallpaper...

785
01:23:38,609 --> 01:23:43,945
...three new bathrooms
and four new closets.

786
01:23:44,215 --> 01:23:48,242
Americans, I think,
are over-devoted...

787
01:23:48,419 --> 01:23:51,411
...to bathrooms and closets.

788
01:23:51,589 --> 01:23:54,217
Well, we accumulate things.

789
01:23:54,392 --> 01:23:57,919
And then you lock them away in closets.

790
01:23:58,229 --> 01:24:00,322
And the bathrooms?

791
01:24:00,698 --> 01:24:03,166
No, no. You don't get me on that one.

792
01:24:04,635 --> 01:24:08,036
- Were you in the war?
- Yes. And you?

793
01:24:08,206 --> 01:24:10,401
No, I missed it by a year.

794
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:17,106
In the war, I was a fighter pilot.

795
01:24:17,415 --> 01:24:20,976
I shot down 17 American planes.

796
01:24:23,688 --> 01:24:26,418
- Okay.
- I believe...

797
01:24:26,591 --> 01:24:29,992
...that some things
must not be left unsaid.

798
01:24:32,396 --> 01:24:34,626
There will come a time...

799
01:24:34,799 --> 01:24:37,267
...when you will ask yourself:

800
01:24:37,435 --> 01:24:41,997
"What did he do in the war?
This man, Yamura?"

801
01:24:43,608 --> 01:24:46,873
- Mr. Yamura, I like you.
- Why?

802
01:24:47,178 --> 01:24:48,907
Well, because...

803
01:24:49,981 --> 01:24:53,883
- Because you come right to the point.
- In a sense...

804
01:24:55,052 --> 01:24:58,283
...you're here because you drive a car...

805
01:24:58,456 --> 01:25:01,584
...the way I conduct my business.

806
01:25:01,759 --> 01:25:03,659
You come right to the point.

807
01:25:08,766 --> 01:25:11,030
- Hello, Mrs. Stoddard. Nice to see you.
- Jeff.

808
01:25:11,202 --> 01:25:13,636
- Scott.
- That's okay, just get me the crutches.

809
01:25:13,804 --> 01:25:15,897
- All right, come here.
- Hello, Mother.

810
01:25:16,073 --> 01:25:19,099
- It's good to have you home.
- How are you? The place looks terrific.

811
01:25:19,277 --> 01:25:21,040
Thanks. Hello.

812
01:25:21,212 --> 01:25:22,975
- Welcome home, sir.
- Thank you.

813
01:25:23,147 --> 01:25:24,705
Gates, come and shake my hand.

814
01:25:24,882 --> 01:25:28,181
- How are you?
- Terrific, thank you.

815
01:25:28,452 --> 01:25:30,386
Come along in.

816
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,455
Careful there, it's slippery.

817
01:25:41,966 --> 01:25:44,127
Can you manage all right?

818
01:25:50,575 --> 01:25:52,600
I'll get Thompson to bring lunch
to your room.

819
01:25:52,777 --> 01:25:55,337
- I'll eat downstairs.
- You can't go downstairs again.

820
01:25:55,513 --> 01:25:59,244
I'm getting up the stairs,
I can certainly get down them again.

821
01:26:08,793 --> 01:26:11,956
If worse comes to the worse,
I can always slide down the banisters.

822
01:26:12,129 --> 01:26:14,825
- Right?
- Yes.

823
01:26:28,012 --> 01:26:31,209
- You'll stay for lunch, Jeff?
- I'd love to.

824
01:26:52,403 --> 01:26:56,134
I should've thought you'd have
cleared this lot out long ago.

825
01:26:57,074 --> 01:27:00,532
- Why?
- Roger's dead.

826
01:27:01,812 --> 01:27:04,804
It's just too bloody morbid.

827
01:27:05,916 --> 01:27:09,215
- Where are your own things?
- I don't know.

828
01:27:09,387 --> 01:27:11,412
Around somewhere.

829
01:27:11,956 --> 01:27:14,754
Of course, they're nothing compared
to this lot.

830
01:27:17,328 --> 01:27:19,023
Something to shoot for, old boy.

831
01:27:19,397 --> 01:27:21,922
You gotta have something to shoot for.

832
01:27:22,867 --> 01:27:26,860
- Okay, you can say what you're thinking.
- What am I thinking?

833
01:27:27,171 --> 01:27:30,607
That I haven't got all this
to shoot for anymore.

834
01:27:33,077 --> 01:27:34,339
But you're wrong, you know.

835
01:27:36,781 --> 01:27:38,749
Quite wrong.

836
01:27:39,183 --> 01:27:42,641
What really scares me, here at Spa,
is driving into a cloudburst.

837
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:44,412
You're doing 160 in the dry...

838
01:27:44,588 --> 01:27:46,886
...then you're suddenly driving
into a wall of rain.

839
01:27:47,058 --> 01:27:48,855
Can't even see the car in front.

840
01:27:49,026 --> 01:27:51,221
Just like trying to swim underwater
in the dark.

841
01:27:51,395 --> 01:27:53,022
Please, Bob, in a moment.

842
01:27:53,197 --> 01:27:54,892
The point is, gentlemen...

843
01:27:55,066 --> 01:27:58,001
...the road condition on the approach
to the S's before Stavalo...

844
01:27:58,169 --> 01:28:00,660
...have not been improved over last year.

845
01:28:00,838 --> 01:28:02,169
If anything, they're worse.

846
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:05,407
I don't see how they could
possibly be worse than last year.

847
01:28:05,576 --> 01:28:07,806
- Let's write them a letter.
- They file letters.

848
01:28:07,978 --> 01:28:11,277
A strongly-worded letter,
official, from the Driver Association.

849
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:13,883
They have a special file
for strongly-worded letters...

850
01:28:14,051 --> 01:28:16,952
...from the association.
- We gonna talk about calling the race off...

851
01:28:17,121 --> 01:28:18,588
...in the event of rain?
- No, no.

852
01:28:18,756 --> 01:28:20,519
Please, Ritchie,
one thing at a time.

853
01:28:20,691 --> 01:28:22,682
The subject is road condition.

854
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:25,920
They haven't changed the road
in 10 years. They not liable to do it.

855
01:28:26,097 --> 01:28:29,157
We know you're taking your life
in your hands driving in the rain.

856
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:32,530
- When are we gonna do something?
- A letter demanding that the road...

857
01:28:32,703 --> 01:28:35,035
...be paved.
- They can't pave the road by tomorrow.

858
01:28:35,206 --> 01:28:38,664
- What's the point in talking about it?
- We talk about this business of rain...

859
01:28:38,843 --> 01:28:41,311
...every year. It's damn well time
we did something.

860
01:28:41,479 --> 01:28:43,470
Well, let's demand to cancel it, if it rains.

861
01:28:43,647 --> 01:28:44,944
You can't cancel this race.

862
01:28:45,116 --> 01:28:47,107
- Or postpone it.
- You can't even postpone it.

863
01:28:48,385 --> 01:28:51,149
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
What about the flag marshaling?

864
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:53,779
Hey, look who's here.

865
01:28:54,959 --> 01:28:56,449
It's Scott.

866
01:29:02,032 --> 01:29:03,556
Find out which room they're in.

867
01:29:04,135 --> 01:29:06,126
- Don't be foolish...
- Come on, man, find out.

868
01:29:06,303 --> 01:29:09,136
- What are you doing here?
- How are you?

869
01:29:09,306 --> 01:29:11,137
How are you?

870
01:29:11,308 --> 01:29:13,776
Hooray! Hooray!

871
01:29:14,612 --> 01:29:16,102
- Hey, Scott.
- Hi.

872
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,976
- How are you?
- Hey, Scott.

873
01:29:20,084 --> 01:29:21,745
How are you?

874
01:29:21,919 --> 01:29:23,113
How are you?

875
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:28,258
Is that you, Pete?

876
01:29:28,425 --> 01:29:29,653
Better be.

877
01:29:36,534 --> 01:29:38,263
Meeting over?

878
01:29:40,805 --> 01:29:42,466
Scott's here.

879
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,335
What?

880
01:29:45,142 --> 01:29:47,337
We'd better have a talk.

881
01:30:06,564 --> 01:30:09,158
What do you wanna talk about, Pete?

882
01:30:31,422 --> 01:30:32,980
May I...?

883
01:30:47,671 --> 01:30:50,765
Really, Scott, this isn't
in very good taste.

884
01:30:52,843 --> 01:30:54,572
That's very good, darling.

885
01:30:54,745 --> 01:30:56,940
That's very good.

886
01:30:57,848 --> 01:30:59,748
Isn't it, Aron?

887
01:31:00,818 --> 01:31:03,446
I'm afraid you got a point, Scott.

888
01:31:03,787 --> 01:31:05,254
He has a point.

889
01:31:06,323 --> 01:31:09,622
- What do you want, Scott?
- You.

890
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:17,330
Do you mind, Aron? I'd like
to have a word with my wife alone.

891
01:31:34,818 --> 01:31:37,480
- I've missed you.
- Well...

892
01:31:37,655 --> 01:31:39,179
...that's a lie for a start.

893
01:31:39,723 --> 01:31:42,283
Why do you say that? It's true.

894
01:31:42,593 --> 01:31:46,620
If you've missed me, it's only because you
haven't had your damn cars to fill your life.

895
01:31:46,797 --> 01:31:50,096
That's all I've ever been good for,
something for you to do between races.

896
01:31:50,267 --> 01:31:51,996
When will you stop belittling yourself?

897
01:31:52,436 --> 01:31:54,870
Don't psychoanalyze me.

898
01:31:55,372 --> 01:31:56,771
I'm sorry.

899
01:31:56,941 --> 01:31:59,102
I hate that sort of thing myself.

900
01:31:59,677 --> 01:32:03,113
You walk in here
and calmly ask him to leave...

901
01:32:03,714 --> 01:32:06,808
...and expect me to believe you care
one way or another about me.

902
01:32:07,117 --> 01:32:10,109
What do you want me to do?
Assault him with my crutches?

903
01:32:16,527 --> 01:32:20,122
- That's not very funny.
- No, it isn't.

904
01:32:24,969 --> 01:32:26,903
I do care.

905
01:32:30,441 --> 01:32:32,204
More than I can talk about.

906
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,971
But that isn't getting us anywhere, is it?

907
01:32:40,584 --> 01:32:42,779
I want you back, Pat.

908
01:32:43,187 --> 01:32:44,711
I'm gonna be driving again soon.

909
01:32:44,888 --> 01:32:46,515
- I need you with me.
- No, no.

910
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:50,820
I've told you, Scott, I can't do it.
I can't live like that.

911
01:32:51,028 --> 01:32:52,552
I won't.

912
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:54,163
What about him? He drives.

913
01:32:55,065 --> 01:32:57,329
- It's different with him.
- Why?

914
01:32:58,335 --> 01:33:00,860
- It just is.
- Because you don't love him.

915
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,764
I don't know what that has
to do with anything.

916
01:33:07,811 --> 01:33:10,974
You know one of the most
beautiful things about a car?

917
01:33:11,148 --> 01:33:13,912
If it isn't working properly,
you can strip the skin off...

918
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:16,983
...expose the insides...

919
01:33:17,154 --> 01:33:19,088
...find out exactly where the trouble is...

920
01:33:19,690 --> 01:33:23,023
...take out the faulty part
and replace it with a new one.

921
01:33:25,229 --> 01:33:27,720
If only we could do that with people.

922
01:33:28,265 --> 01:33:29,698
Good luck.

923
01:33:30,567 --> 01:33:32,728
Luck has nothing to do with this either.

924
01:33:35,339 --> 01:33:36,966
Bye.

925
01:33:37,374 --> 01:33:40,036
<i>With Jean-Pierre Sarti's Ferrari</i>
<i>in pole position.</i>

926
01:33:48,052 --> 01:33:50,680
<i>Ten seconds to the start</i>
<i>of the Belgian Grand Prix.</i>

927
01:37:23,767 --> 01:37:25,325
<i>Sarti's in the lead at La Source.</i>

928
01:37:25,502 --> 01:37:28,903
<i>Almost the end of the first lap, and already</i>
<i>he's ahead of the second car.</i>

929
01:37:29,072 --> 01:37:30,733
<i>It's Pete Aron's Yamura.</i>

930
01:37:38,148 --> 01:37:41,117
<i>And there's Brabham running right</i>
<i>round the outside of Barlini.</i>

931
01:37:41,285 --> 01:37:42,547
<i>Brabham in third place...</i>

932
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:45,483
<i>... but the Ferrari might just take him</i>
<i>again on acceleration.</i>

933
01:37:45,656 --> 01:37:48,784
<i>They're side by side, down past the pits.</i>
<i>Barlini's going ahead.</i>

934
01:37:48,959 --> 01:37:53,362
<i>He's outbraked Brabham into Eau Rouge,</i>
<i>and it's number seven Ferrari in third place.</i>

935
01:38:43,413 --> 01:38:46,348
<i>And it's Jean-Pierre Sarti completing</i>
<i>his 16th lap.</i>

936
01:38:46,516 --> 01:38:48,507
<i>The race is now half over.</i>

937
01:38:48,685 --> 01:38:52,416
<i>Since the rain began, he's increased</i>
<i>his lead by three or four seconds a lap.</i>

938
01:38:52,589 --> 01:38:56,218
<i>The worse the conditions,</i>
<i>the bigger the old champion's advantage.</i>

939
01:38:56,393 --> 01:39:01,262
<i>If the Ferrari keeps going, this will be</i>
<i>his third Grand Prix win of the season.</i>

940
01:39:14,644 --> 01:39:17,238
<i>Barlini's also very fast in the wet.</i>

941
01:39:17,414 --> 01:39:19,746
<i>He's now a clear third ahead</i>
<i>of Jack Brabham.</i>

942
01:39:22,786 --> 01:39:24,913
<i>There's Jochen Rindt coming out</i>
<i>of La Source.</i>

943
01:39:25,088 --> 01:39:28,455
<i>He lost nearly a lap when he spun</i>
<i>in the worst of the cloudburst.</i>

944
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:31,594
<i>And there he is passing Guy Ligier,</i>
<i>moving up another place.</i>

945
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:18,931
<i>Here's the leader, completing</i>
<i>his 30th lap. He's got a big lead.</i>

946
01:40:19,142 --> 01:40:22,509
<i>Jean-Pierre Sarti, winner of Monaco</i>
<i>and French Grand Prixs...</i>

947
01:40:22,679 --> 01:40:25,807
<i>... is only two laps away</i>
<i>from his third consecutive win.</i>

948
01:42:00,210 --> 01:42:02,405
<i>Here's the winner now.</i>
<i>The Yamura wins...</i>

949
01:42:02,579 --> 01:42:06,037
<i>... and Pete Aron wins the Belgian Grand Prix</i>
<i>in the white Yamura from Japan.</i>

950
01:42:12,989 --> 01:42:15,423
<i>But as Pete Aron</i>
<i>comes in after his victory...</i>

951
01:42:15,592 --> 01:42:17,583
<i>... there's Izo Yamura...</i>

952
01:42:17,761 --> 01:42:20,855
<i>... going to congratulate him</i>
<i>for bringing the...</i>

953
01:42:21,031 --> 01:42:24,694
<i>His car home in first place</i>
<i>today in the Belgian Grand Prix.</i>

954
01:42:24,868 --> 01:42:28,599
<i>Pete Aron, of course, won five Grand Prixs</i>
<i>in the past when he was with Ferraris...</i>

955
01:42:28,772 --> 01:42:32,071
<i>... but that was three years ago.</i>
<i>He's had a lot of bad luck since then.</i>

956
01:42:32,242 --> 01:42:35,234
<i>It's great to see him back</i>
<i>in the winning position...</i>

957
01:42:35,412 --> 01:42:38,381
- He drove a good race.
<i>...so soon after joining the up-and-coming...</i>

958
01:42:38,548 --> 01:42:40,379
<i>... Yamura team from Japan.</i>

959
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:43,314
We'll see how good
he is at Zandvoort.

960
01:42:44,754 --> 01:42:48,190
<i>Barlini's second place for Ferrari, too,</i>
<i>will be very popular in Italy.</i>

961
01:42:48,358 --> 01:42:53,796
<i>And there's Aron now, up on the platform</i>
<i>being presented with a garland of flowers...</i>

962
01:42:53,964 --> 01:42:56,091
<i>... and Mr. Yamura joining him.</i>

963
01:42:56,266 --> 01:42:59,929
<i>Both delighted with the quick success</i>
<i>of this new partnership...</i>

964
01:43:00,103 --> 01:43:05,063
<i>... which has brought Yamura his first</i>
<i>Grand Prix victory after two years of flying.</i>

965
01:43:05,241 --> 01:43:08,039
<i>He must be very pleased, indeed,</i>
<i>with Aron's performance today.</i>

966
01:43:08,211 --> 01:43:12,045
<i>The 400 horsepower Yamura,</i>
<i>the most powerful of all the cars in the...</i>

967
01:43:12,215 --> 01:43:14,240
Albert! Groat!

968
01:43:18,521 --> 01:43:21,012
- Let him go. Let him go.
<i>- And here's Sarti coming in...</i>

969
01:43:21,191 --> 01:43:22,419
Are you all right?

970
01:43:26,029 --> 01:43:29,362
Out of the way.
Out of the way, everybody.

971
01:43:29,633 --> 01:43:32,625
Children? There were children?

972
01:43:34,004 --> 01:43:37,440
I'm afraid Paris is impossible
this week, darling.

973
01:43:37,841 --> 01:43:39,638
I must go right to Modena.

974
01:43:39,809 --> 01:43:41,538
The car...

975
01:43:41,711 --> 01:43:44,441
...it's completely
wiped out, you see.

976
01:43:44,948 --> 01:43:47,246
It will be necessary to...

977
01:43:57,627 --> 01:43:59,288
Stop it, Guido.

978
01:44:00,997 --> 01:44:02,760
- Stop it.
- Get him out of here.

979
01:44:07,771 --> 01:44:11,207
It will be necessary to test a new one
for the Nürburgring.

980
01:44:11,374 --> 01:44:14,400
A very difficult course,
but one of the most beautiful.

981
01:44:14,577 --> 01:44:17,011
- You will...
- Oh, stop.

982
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:40,885
Thing is, will it start?

983
01:46:42,197 --> 01:46:43,255
It'll start.

984
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:55,467
Yeah, Roger had some
very big days in this car.

985
01:49:53,121 --> 01:49:56,113
<i>Coming into the pits now</i>
<i>is Scott Stoddard in the BRM.</i>

986
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:59,623
<i>The Dutch Grand Prix, here at Zandvoort</i>
<i>tomorrow, will be his first race...</i>

987
01:49:59,794 --> 01:50:01,853
<i>... since his accident</i>
<i>at Monte Carlo in May.</i>

988
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:04,464
<i>His serious injuries</i>
<i>must be extremely painful.</i>

989
01:50:04,632 --> 01:50:07,465
- How did I do?
- You just set a new lap record.

990
01:50:07,635 --> 01:50:09,569
<i>The whole BRM crew</i>
<i>look very pleased.</i>

991
01:50:09,737 --> 01:50:11,728
Right, you owe me
a bottle of the best.

992
01:50:11,906 --> 01:50:13,533
- Yes, indeed I do.
<i>- Yamura.</i>

993
01:50:13,708 --> 01:50:15,835
<i>One minute, 26.5 seconds...</i>

994
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:18,342
<i>... 108.5 miles an hour.</i>

995
01:50:18,513 --> 01:50:22,347
<i>Aron, the American driver, won</i>
<i>the last two Grand Prixs at Spa in Belgium.</i>

996
01:50:22,517 --> 01:50:25,213
<i>And the German Grand Prix last week</i>
<i>at the Nürburgring.</i>

997
01:50:25,386 --> 01:50:28,219
<i>He now shares the lead</i>
<i>in the World Championship with 18 points.</i>

998
01:50:28,389 --> 01:50:32,382
<i>Exactly the same as the Ferrari driver,</i>
<i>Jean-Pierre Sarti, the Frenchman.</i>

999
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:36,724
<i>Sarti's best practice time so far</i>
<i>on this 2.6- Mile Zandvoort circuit...</i>

1000
01:50:36,898 --> 01:50:39,162
<i>... is one minute, 27. 1.</i>

1001
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:42,962
<i>Now, here's Stoddard's best lap.</i>
<i>One minute, 25.9.</i>

1002
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:45,298
<i>The fastest lap ever on this circuit.</i>

1003
01:50:45,473 --> 01:50:48,499
<i>What a wonderful comeback</i>
<i>for this brave young driver.</i>

1004
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:22,678
What a shame.
He's falling off.

1005
01:54:44,078 --> 01:54:45,067
Cheers.

1006
01:54:45,246 --> 01:54:47,111
Cheers.

1007
01:55:08,936 --> 01:55:10,301
Then it seems to be all right?

1008
01:55:10,471 --> 01:55:13,998
Of course it seems to be all right.
It's always all right when you're around.

1009
01:55:14,175 --> 01:55:15,972
Then there is nothing wrong, is there?

1010
01:55:16,143 --> 01:55:19,237
It stuck in practice yesterday,
and it still doesn't feel right.

1011
01:55:19,413 --> 01:55:22,678
- But it doesn't stick now!
- I'm telling you, it does!

1012
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:26,013
Jean-Pierre, just because
you have been running badly lately...

1013
01:55:26,187 --> 01:55:28,314
...it's no reason
to take these things out on me.

1014
01:55:28,489 --> 01:55:30,684
If you want a day off this afternoon,
just say so.

1015
01:55:30,858 --> 01:55:34,259
I'm here to race. Understand?

1016
01:55:34,428 --> 01:55:37,226
- To race.
- Okay, be quiet.

1017
01:55:42,269 --> 01:55:45,363
There you are, my beauty.

1018
01:55:50,678 --> 01:55:55,615
- See if it's all there, will you, my man?
- It better all be there. Half of it's mine.

1019
01:56:00,154 --> 01:56:05,114
Does that look like $ 17,000 to you?

1020
01:56:06,627 --> 01:56:07,992
Yeah.

1021
01:56:10,731 --> 01:56:12,221
Marvel.

1022
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:17,235
That's what you are, Scott.
A bloody marvel.

1023
01:56:38,726 --> 01:56:43,288
Here. You know,
of course, what you did here.

1024
01:56:43,497 --> 01:56:46,125
I know. I don't have to
see it up there to know.

1025
01:56:46,901 --> 01:56:50,496
It's bad enough to lose
without having to watch yourself do it.

1026
01:56:50,671 --> 01:56:52,696
What's the point of this anyway?

1027
01:56:52,873 --> 01:56:58,106
To see if we can determine
why you are losing.

1028
01:56:58,612 --> 01:57:01,103
Well, you're not gonna find
the answer up there.

1029
01:57:01,282 --> 01:57:05,412
What about your other two drivers?
Why aren't they here? Why only me?

1030
01:57:05,586 --> 01:57:11,252
Because they are not winners.
But you are.

1031
01:57:11,792 --> 01:57:14,920
You are losing to a man who needs...

1032
01:57:15,095 --> 01:57:19,429
...almost to be carried
to and from his car.

1033
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:22,068
How can that be?

1034
01:57:24,872 --> 01:57:27,898
Because he's driving better than I am.
He's making fewer mistakes.

1035
01:57:28,075 --> 01:57:31,203
- That's why anyone wins.
- Exactly.

1036
01:57:31,378 --> 01:57:36,941
Now, shall we turn our attention
to the mistakes?

1037
01:57:50,965 --> 01:57:53,024
About-face.

1038
01:57:55,536 --> 01:57:59,063
By the left, quick march.

1039
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:23,321
<i>Today's British Grand Prix will be Nino</i>
<i>Barlini's first race here at Brands Hatch.</i>

1040
01:58:23,497 --> 01:58:27,024
<i>But his teammate, Jean-Pierre Sarti</i>
<i>of France, the number-one Ferrari driver...</i>

1041
01:58:27,201 --> 01:58:30,034
<i>... and Pete Aron of the Yamura team,</i>
<i>have both driven before...</i>

1042
01:58:30,204 --> 01:58:31,865
<i>... here on England's premier circuit.</i>

1043
01:58:32,039 --> 01:58:35,270
<i>The second Yamura driver, Tim Randolph,</i>
<i>comes from the United States...</i>

1044
01:58:35,442 --> 01:58:39,606
<i>... as does Pete Aron, who's already won</i>
<i>the Belgian and German Grand Prixs.</i>

1045
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:43,477
<i>There are 24 starters in this British Grand</i>
<i>Prix. They're on the dummy grid now...</i>

1046
01:58:43,651 --> 01:58:46,245
<i>... getting last-minute instructions</i>
<i>from the team managers.</i>

1047
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:47,978
<i>There's BRM driver, Bob Turner.</i>

1048
01:58:48,188 --> 01:58:50,816
<i>Mr. Yamura himself is with Pete Aron.</i>

1049
01:58:50,991 --> 01:58:54,427
<i>And there's the winner of the last three</i>
<i>Grand Prixs, Scott Stoddard...</i>

1050
01:58:54,595 --> 01:58:57,155
<i>... who's still recovering</i>
<i>from his Monte Carlo injuries...</i>

1051
01:58:57,331 --> 01:58:59,891
<i>... and leads the World Championship</i>
<i>with two races to go.</i>

1052
01:59:00,067 --> 01:59:03,127
<i>There's Jimmy Clark, the Scotsman,</i>
<i>who has twice been world champion.</i>

1053
01:59:04,672 --> 01:59:07,436
<i>That's the signal to clear the grid.</i>
<i>The engines are starting.</i>

1054
01:59:07,608 --> 01:59:10,133
<i>The mechanics and photographers</i>
<i>are moving off the track.</i>

1055
01:59:14,882 --> 01:59:17,009
<i>Now the field rolls forward</i>
<i>to the final grid...</i>

1056
01:59:17,184 --> 01:59:21,018
<i>... where they'll be held for a few seconds</i>
<i>before the starter drops the Union Jack...</i>

1057
01:59:21,188 --> 01:59:23,486
<i>... and then the British Grand Prix</i>
<i>will be under way.</i>

1058
02:01:21,608 --> 02:01:24,042
<i>In the lead after 15 laps</i>
<i>is Scott Stoddard...</i>

1059
02:01:24,211 --> 02:01:25,576
<i>... but he's losing ground now.</i>

1060
02:01:25,746 --> 02:01:28,442
<i>Stoddard, in the dark-green BRM</i>
<i>number four, made a slow start...</i>

1061
02:01:28,615 --> 02:01:30,742
<i>... then worked his way</i>
<i>to the front of the field.</i>

1062
02:01:30,918 --> 02:01:33,409
<i>During the first 12 laps</i>
<i>he built up a substantial lead.</i>

1063
02:01:33,587 --> 02:01:36,818
<i>- But his lap times are slower now...</i>
- His lap times are awfully erratic.

1064
02:01:36,990 --> 02:01:39,891
<i>- On the BRM. They're Barlini, number 18,</i>
<i>who was just ahead...</i>

1065
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:43,962
<i>... of number 17, Jean-Pierre Sarti,</i>
<i>14, Pete Aron, and 11, Jochen Rindt.</i>

1066
02:01:44,131 --> 02:01:47,589
<i>These three are having a great dice</i>
<i>for third place.</i>

1067
02:02:08,088 --> 02:02:10,318
<i>At Bottom Bend,</i>
<i>Stoddard lost three more places.</i>

1068
02:02:10,491 --> 02:02:12,686
If he keeps missing shifts,
the car will never last.

1069
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:16,193
It'll last longer than he will.
He's finished already.

1070
02:02:16,363 --> 02:02:19,560
<i>Barlini's the leader,</i>
<i>but he's not far ahead of Sarti and Aron.</i>

1071
02:02:21,435 --> 02:02:23,903
<i>Here's Stoddard coming into the pits</i>
<i>very slowly.</i>

1072
02:02:24,071 --> 02:02:26,471
<i>Goodness, he looks as if</i>
<i>he's on the edge of collapse.</i>

1073
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:30,007
<i>What a shame,</i>
<i>he was driving a beautiful race.</i>

1074
02:02:34,615 --> 02:02:36,981
<i>Scott Stoddard</i>
<i>does seem to be in a bad way.</i>

1075
02:02:37,151 --> 02:02:40,712
<i>His retirement certainly puts</i>
<i>a new complexion on the race.</i>

1076
02:02:40,888 --> 02:02:43,982
<i>Barlini leads, but Ferrari team leader</i>
<i>Sarti, Aron...</i>

1077
02:02:44,158 --> 02:02:46,456
<i>... and Rindt, all have</i>
<i>the Sicilian in their sights.</i>

1078
02:02:46,627 --> 02:02:49,289
<i>A tremendous battle for second place</i>
<i>between Sarti and Aron.</i>

1079
02:02:49,463 --> 02:02:52,955
<i>Although there's one more World</i>
<i>Championship race to go at Monza in Italy...</i>

1080
02:02:53,133 --> 02:02:57,467
<i>... the result here at Brands Hatch</i>
<i>is very important to both these men.</i>

1081
02:02:57,638 --> 02:03:01,039
<i>Izo Yamura himself is dedicated to winning</i>
<i>the Constructors Championship...</i>

1082
02:03:01,208 --> 02:03:03,438
<i>... and Aron is his only hope</i>
<i>here at Brands.</i>

1083
02:03:03,610 --> 02:03:07,376
<i>His second car, driven by Tim Randolph,</i>
<i>blew up its engine early in the race.</i>

1084
02:03:21,628 --> 02:03:23,596
<i>Here comes the leader, Barlini.</i>

1085
02:03:25,432 --> 02:03:28,629
<i>He's not far ahead</i>
<i>of Sarti, Aron and Rindt.</i>

1086
02:03:31,672 --> 02:03:34,004
<i>One lap to go.</i>
<i>Sarti and Aron are close to Barlini.</i>

1087
02:03:34,174 --> 02:03:35,903
- The last lap.
<i>- Aron hasn't a chance...</i>

1088
02:03:36,076 --> 02:03:39,045
<i>... of getting past both Ferraris. This is</i>
<i>going to be the most exciting finish...</i>

1089
02:03:39,213 --> 02:03:41,272
<i>... of the Grand Prix season so far.</i>

1090
02:03:51,658 --> 02:03:55,594
<i>At Bottom Bend, the first four</i>
<i>are nose-to-tail: Barlini, Sarti, Aron, Rindt.</i>

1091
02:03:58,832 --> 02:04:00,629
<i>Barlini dare not let Sarti through.</i>

1092
02:04:00,801 --> 02:04:03,201
<i>It's much too dodgy</i>
<i>with the Yamura right behind.</i>

1093
02:04:03,871 --> 02:04:07,329
Look. He's spilling something.
Looks like fuel.

1094
02:04:07,507 --> 02:04:08,735
Gas leaking?

1095
02:04:33,533 --> 02:04:35,933
<i>As they come into Clearways,</i>
<i>Barlini's still in front.</i>

1096
02:04:36,103 --> 02:04:38,071
<i>The Yamura's smoking badly. It's on fire.</i>

1097
02:04:38,238 --> 02:04:39,637
He's on fire!

1098
02:04:39,806 --> 02:04:42,639
<i>The Yamura's second,</i>
<i>ahead of Sarti's Ferrari. It's on fire.</i>

1099
02:04:42,809 --> 02:04:45,778
<i>It's well and truly on fire.</i>
<i>But Aron's not slowing.</i>

1100
02:04:45,946 --> 02:04:49,939
<i>He's gonna beat Sarti to the finish.</i>
<i>There's the flag, Barlini wins for Ferrari.</i>

1101
02:04:50,117 --> 02:04:52,551
<i>Aron's second and Sarti third.</i>

1102
02:04:52,719 --> 02:04:54,243
<i>The Yamura's</i>
<i>pulling off the track.</i>

1103
02:04:54,421 --> 02:04:58,084
<i>There are flames shooting out of the back</i>
<i>of the car. Let's hope Aron can get out.</i>

1104
02:04:58,258 --> 02:05:00,749
<i>There's a fire crew right there.</i>
<i>He should be all right.</i>

1105
02:05:00,928 --> 02:05:03,362
<i>He's rolled out of the car.</i>
<i>Keep back. Keep back.</i>

1106
02:05:03,530 --> 02:05:07,864
<i>What a shambles. Some of the crowd</i>
<i>are rushing to the fire, and Sarti's stopping.</i>

1107
02:05:08,035 --> 02:05:10,196
<i>He's going to see</i>
<i>if there's anything he can do.</i>

1108
02:05:10,370 --> 02:05:13,430
<i>Izo Yamura's also running</i>
<i>across the track with Tim Randolph.</i>

1109
02:05:13,607 --> 02:05:16,007
<i>From here, it looks</i>
<i>as though Pete Aron's on his feet.</i>

1110
02:05:16,176 --> 02:05:18,041
<i>- He must be okay...</i>
- Are you all right?

1111
02:05:18,211 --> 02:05:20,338
- I'm okay.
<i>- For the last few seconds of the race.</i>

1112
02:05:20,514 --> 02:05:22,482
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1113
02:05:22,649 --> 02:05:24,742
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, what'd we make?

1114
02:05:24,918 --> 02:05:27,045
- Second.
- I'm a regular ball of fire.

1115
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:30,189
<i>A fire like this is what these drivers</i>
<i>are most afraid of.</i>

1116
02:05:30,357 --> 02:05:33,451
<i>Nowadays their fireproof overalls</i>
<i>give them a good deal of protection.</i>

1117
02:05:33,627 --> 02:05:35,754
- Get out of here!
<i>- Photographers must keep back.</i>

1118
02:05:35,929 --> 02:05:37,760
<i>Please keep back.</i>

1119
02:05:45,005 --> 02:05:49,066
<i>Nino Barlini's up there on the trailer</i>
<i>ready to go around on his lap of honor.</i>

1120
02:05:49,242 --> 02:05:52,336
<i>The team manager of Ferrari is there too.</i>

1121
02:05:53,613 --> 02:05:58,277
<i>And there's a beautiful bird coming up</i>
<i>to join him on the trailer.</i>

1122
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:02,012
Hey, Nino.

1123
02:06:02,189 --> 02:06:04,714
Nino Barlini, excuse me. Congratulations.

1124
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:07,018
- How do you feel after that victory?
- Thank you.

1125
02:06:07,194 --> 02:06:11,563
My neck hurts, my leg.
My hand is bleeding. And I feel wonderful.

1126
02:06:11,732 --> 02:06:14,223
Well, I don't know
if you've had time to realize it...

1127
02:06:14,401 --> 02:06:17,564
...but this means that you're one point
ahead of Sarti and Stoddard...

1128
02:06:17,738 --> 02:06:21,003
...and two points ahead of Pete Aron.
- Of course I realize it.

1129
02:06:21,174 --> 02:06:23,574
And with one race to go at Monza...

1130
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:26,679
...the man who wins at Monza
will be the world champion.

1131
02:06:26,847 --> 02:06:28,474
I am the man.

1132
02:06:28,648 --> 02:06:32,140
So long, Nino. Congratulations.

1133
02:06:34,021 --> 02:06:36,854
I feel wonderful.

1134
02:07:08,255 --> 02:07:09,654
Yeah, come in.

1135
02:07:21,968 --> 02:07:23,196
How are you?

1136
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:32,342
I'm pretty bloody awful.

1137
02:07:32,846 --> 02:07:34,507
How are you?

1138
02:07:51,932 --> 02:07:53,695
Would you...

1139
02:07:53,867 --> 02:07:55,232
...care to sit down?

1140
02:08:02,609 --> 02:08:04,873
This has been a ridiculous few weeks,
hasn't it?

1141
02:08:06,279 --> 02:08:07,405
Has it?

1142
02:08:09,382 --> 02:08:12,943
Well, I mean, seeing each other
at the races and not...

1143
02:08:14,588 --> 02:08:16,021
Well, ignoring each other.

1144
02:08:17,591 --> 02:08:19,286
Trying to.

1145
02:08:24,698 --> 02:08:27,394
I've been alone.

1146
02:08:28,068 --> 02:08:30,229
You know that, don't you?

1147
02:08:31,471 --> 02:08:33,701
Yeah. Here.

1148
02:08:35,342 --> 02:08:39,108
- Pete said you had guts, and I...
- I'm not really interested in what he said.

1149
02:08:39,913 --> 02:08:42,677
I certainly don't want to discuss him
with you. I've told you.

1150
02:08:42,849 --> 02:08:44,407
I didn't mean...

1151
02:08:45,685 --> 02:08:49,212
I meant that when he said you had guts,
I said you were only stubborn.

1152
02:08:49,389 --> 02:08:53,018
I just wanted to tell you
that he was right and I was wrong.

1153
02:08:54,461 --> 02:08:57,430
Watching what you've been doing
these past few weeks...

1154
02:08:58,999 --> 02:09:01,229
You shouldn't have been doing it alone.

1155
02:09:01,768 --> 02:09:04,134
Yeah, there's only room for one
in the car, you know.

1156
02:09:04,404 --> 02:09:07,532
- I don't mean that. You know I don't.
- I know.

1157
02:09:08,475 --> 02:09:10,238
It was a joke.

1158
02:09:11,678 --> 02:09:13,771
Do you still want me, Scott?

1159
02:09:18,919 --> 02:09:20,443
Yes.

1160
02:09:22,522 --> 02:09:25,491
I still feel the same
about what you're doing.

1161
02:09:25,659 --> 02:09:28,150
That hasn't changed, you know.

1162
02:09:28,328 --> 02:09:29,625
I think you're a fool.

1163
02:09:30,764 --> 02:09:32,698
Yeah, I know.

1164
02:09:35,001 --> 02:09:36,832
But...

1165
02:09:38,738 --> 02:09:41,366
...I haven't changed either, you know.

1166
02:09:42,709 --> 02:09:44,267
I mean...

1167
02:09:48,048 --> 02:09:50,516
...I really can't promise you anything.

1168
02:09:50,684 --> 02:09:52,618
That's all right.

1169
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:57,078
That's the problem, really.
People promise each other too much.

1170
02:11:03,757 --> 02:11:05,987
What's wrong, Jean-Pierre?

1171
02:11:07,661 --> 02:11:09,356
What is it?

1172
02:11:11,931 --> 02:11:15,560
There's nothing you can do
about what's wrong with me, Louise.

1173
02:11:15,769 --> 02:11:18,932
I won't admit that
until I know what's troubling you.

1174
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:23,767
I suppose what's wrong with me
is my life.

1175
02:11:24,010 --> 02:11:27,776
But I can't change it. Or won't.

1176
02:11:29,082 --> 02:11:31,915
So there's nothing you can do for me.

1177
02:11:33,453 --> 02:11:35,683
What's wrong with your life?

1178
02:11:36,623 --> 02:11:40,184
I've begun to see the absurdity of it.

1179
02:11:41,094 --> 02:11:42,994
All of us.

1180
02:11:45,265 --> 02:11:47,256
Proving what?

1181
02:11:47,901 --> 02:11:49,664
That we can go faster?

1182
02:11:49,836 --> 02:11:52,361
And perhaps remain alive?

1183
02:11:54,274 --> 02:11:57,471
Nino, gambling his life for a trophy...

1184
02:11:57,644 --> 02:12:00,238
...then fills it with beer and does tricks.

1185
02:12:00,647 --> 02:12:03,844
Stoddard, filling himself with drugs
in order to drive...

1186
02:12:04,017 --> 02:12:06,042
...and still passing out with the pain.

1187
02:12:06,219 --> 02:12:09,313
Don't you see how absurd it all is?
Who cares?

1188
02:12:10,724 --> 02:12:12,658
I thought you cared.

1189
02:12:12,859 --> 02:12:14,884
For yourselves.

1190
02:12:16,029 --> 02:12:18,862
I didn't know you asked it
of anyone else.

1191
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:21,726
Nevertheless, others do care.

1192
02:12:21,901 --> 02:12:23,698
A hundred thousand
of them cared today.

1193
02:12:23,870 --> 02:12:27,306
And did you see them rush
to see Peter burn?

1194
02:12:27,474 --> 02:12:31,843
Did you see the looks
on their faces? I saw.

1195
02:12:32,011 --> 02:12:35,674
For the first time today,
I really saw those faces.

1196
02:12:35,849 --> 02:12:37,407
But not all of them, Jean-Pierre.

1197
02:12:37,584 --> 02:12:42,044
There are some who come for that,
for the accidents and the fires.

1198
02:12:43,757 --> 02:12:48,387
But the others,
the others ride with you, maybe.

1199
02:12:49,295 --> 02:12:54,096
You put something in their lives
that they can't put there themselves.

1200
02:12:55,969 --> 02:12:57,402
Are you one of those?

1201
02:13:02,275 --> 02:13:03,537
It doesn't matter.

1202
02:13:06,346 --> 02:13:07,836
Yes, it does.

1203
02:13:08,648 --> 02:13:11,173
Maybe I am one of those.

1204
02:13:12,285 --> 02:13:15,584
When I came here three months ago...

1205
02:13:15,755 --> 02:13:21,557
...there was a place in my life
that needed to be filled.

1206
02:13:22,395 --> 02:13:23,384
You've done that.

1207
02:13:25,465 --> 02:13:29,367
You and, I suppose,
the excitement of what you do.

1208
02:13:30,503 --> 02:13:32,300
But you offered me these things.

1209
02:13:32,472 --> 02:13:35,873
You can't condemn me now
for having accepted them.

1210
02:13:36,176 --> 02:13:39,737
No, I don't condemn you
for that, darling.

1211
02:13:40,447 --> 02:13:42,005
Sorry.

1212
02:13:47,754 --> 02:13:50,018
Jean-Pierre, you can stop.

1213
02:13:51,224 --> 02:13:55,888
If you feel as you do,
you could stop now.

1214
02:13:58,298 --> 02:14:02,758
No, it's not so easy.

1215
02:14:04,804 --> 02:14:06,499
Not so easy.

1216
02:14:09,542 --> 02:14:12,010
Not so easy.

1217
02:14:16,182 --> 02:14:18,343
<i>With the Italian Grand Prix</i>
<i>at the Monza Autodrome...</i>

1218
02:14:18,518 --> 02:14:21,783
<i>... they're using a combination</i>
<i>of the banked oval high-speed track...</i>

1219
02:14:21,955 --> 02:14:23,513
<i>... and the road circuit.</i>

1220
02:14:23,690 --> 02:14:26,022
<i>The whole thing comes</i>
<i>to six and a quarter miles...</i>

1221
02:14:26,192 --> 02:14:29,059
<i>... just over half of this length</i>
<i>being the road circuit...</i>

1222
02:14:29,229 --> 02:14:31,697
<i>... with its fast corners</i>
<i>and long straights.</i>

1223
02:14:31,865 --> 02:14:34,493
<i>By itself, it's one of the</i>
<i>fastest circuits in the world.</i>

1224
02:14:34,667 --> 02:14:38,865
<i>And combined with the oval track,</i>
<i>it should give some phenomenal speeds.</i>

1225
02:14:56,456 --> 02:14:59,186
Why hasn't my car arrived, Guido?

1226
02:14:59,359 --> 02:15:02,089
It's no longer in my hands,
Jean-Pierre.

1227
02:15:32,725 --> 02:15:34,158
What's the trouble?

1228
02:15:34,327 --> 02:15:37,763
My car hasn't arrived
from the factory.

1229
02:15:38,364 --> 02:15:40,332
The same thing
has happened before.

1230
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:44,664
Not to me, but to other drivers
who have fallen from grace.

1231
02:15:44,871 --> 02:15:46,168
Pressure.

1232
02:15:46,339 --> 02:15:47,772
Pressure?

1233
02:15:47,941 --> 02:15:50,535
Isn't there enough of that as it is?

1234
02:15:50,977 --> 02:15:54,913
You have to grasp the mind
of Signor Manetta, my darling.

1235
02:15:55,181 --> 02:15:57,342
If a driver can be reached
by those tactics...

1236
02:15:57,517 --> 02:16:00,782
...it means he probably will fear
for his place on the team.

1237
02:16:00,954 --> 02:16:03,354
That is exactly
what Manetta wants.

1238
02:16:03,523 --> 02:16:07,152
Because that driver will try
all the harder to win.

1239
02:16:07,327 --> 02:16:11,730
He will perhaps take a risk
which he would ordinarily avoid.

1240
02:16:11,898 --> 02:16:16,267
And risks are always risks.

1241
02:16:17,971 --> 02:16:20,064
But the car will come.

1242
02:16:20,239 --> 02:16:23,731
Well, if it doesn't,
I'll use my influence...

1243
02:16:23,910 --> 02:16:27,073
...and I'll get you the best seat
in the grandstand.

1244
02:16:35,355 --> 02:16:39,018
- No sign of it?
- No.

1245
02:16:39,192 --> 02:16:42,355
Don't worry, Jean-Pierre.
That's what they want you to do.

1246
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:45,427
He makes a great mistake, then.

1247
02:16:58,411 --> 02:17:01,209
Are you sure
you wanted it to come?

1248
02:17:09,188 --> 02:17:13,750
<i>A maximum of about 180 miles an hour</i>
<i>can be expected from these 3-liter cars...</i>

1249
02:17:13,926 --> 02:17:16,520
<i>... on this high banking,</i>
<i>where they get...</i>

1250
02:17:16,863 --> 02:17:21,527
<i>... a pounding from the rough surface and</i>
<i>the strain imposed by centrifugal force...</i>

1251
02:17:21,701 --> 02:17:24,192
<i>... before they swoop down</i>
<i>onto the road circuit again...</i>

1252
02:17:24,370 --> 02:17:27,601
<i>... where cornering power</i>
<i>and handling are at the premium.</i>

1253
02:17:41,054 --> 02:17:44,956
- Good afternoon, Nino.
- Madame Sarti.

1254
02:18:06,846 --> 02:18:09,781
Have you met Miss Frederickson?
Madame Sarti.

1255
02:18:12,051 --> 02:18:15,987
- Hello, Monique.
- Hello, Louise.

1256
02:18:17,557 --> 02:18:20,390
So you are leading in points
for the championship, Nino.

1257
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:24,660
But not by as many points
as I would like, Madame Sarti.

1258
02:18:24,997 --> 02:18:27,864
All you have to do
is to beat my husband.

1259
02:18:28,534 --> 02:18:31,332
The question is,
is he ready to be beaten?

1260
02:18:36,442 --> 02:18:40,606
Please excuse me,
I have some work to do back at the hotel.

1261
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:43,881
- Nino, tell Jean-Pierre...
- Yes, yes.

1262
02:18:50,757 --> 02:18:54,056
- She's quite good-looking, isn't she?
- Yes.

1263
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:58,221
Of course, for one
who cares for the type.

1264
02:18:59,499 --> 02:19:03,094
Yes. Excuse me,
Madame Sarti.

1265
02:19:24,023 --> 02:19:27,390
Oh, no, wait.
Let me stand... It's better?

1266
02:19:34,233 --> 02:19:38,693
The question is, Jean-Pierre,
what are you going to do about it?

1267
02:19:38,871 --> 02:19:40,805
Do?
I don't understand.

1268
02:19:41,340 --> 02:19:44,707
The time for losing comes
to every man, of course.

1269
02:19:44,877 --> 02:19:47,971
I had not expected yours
to come so soon.

1270
02:19:48,414 --> 02:19:50,314
There have been problems with the car.

1271
02:19:50,483 --> 02:19:51,848
Come, come, Sarti.

1272
02:19:52,018 --> 02:19:55,419
I expect excuses like that
from lesser men than you.

1273
02:19:56,055 --> 02:19:58,580
You've been one of the best
that ever lived.

1274
02:19:58,791 --> 02:20:01,487
There is no question of that
in my mind.

1275
02:20:01,661 --> 02:20:06,758
Never a wrong move, the concentration
always there 100 percent.

1276
02:20:07,867 --> 02:20:09,858
Until this woman.

1277
02:20:10,236 --> 02:20:13,205
You have been misled,
Signor Manetta.

1278
02:20:13,372 --> 02:20:16,705
Do you take me for a trained dog
to jump at the snap of your fingers?

1279
02:20:16,876 --> 02:20:18,844
My life belongs
to no one but myself.

1280
02:20:19,011 --> 02:20:22,970
I've been thinking seriously
of your retirement, Sarti.

1281
02:20:23,282 --> 02:20:24,579
Then retire me now.

1282
02:20:27,253 --> 02:20:29,778
Kindly lower your voice.

1283
02:20:29,989 --> 02:20:32,014
Of course I will not retire you now.

1284
02:20:32,191 --> 02:20:33,954
Tomorrow there is a race to be run.

1285
02:20:34,126 --> 02:20:37,755
And I also well know
that you want to drive it.

1286
02:20:40,066 --> 02:20:43,729
But after tomorrow,
who knows, Jean-Pierre?

1287
02:20:44,770 --> 02:20:49,571
After tomorrow, Signor Manetta,
I will decide to retire or not.

1288
02:20:49,742 --> 02:20:53,473
Sarti, you are even further gone
than I thought.

1289
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:56,648
A pity.
A great pity.

1290
02:20:57,350 --> 02:21:00,808
I always considered you
to be the best.

1291
02:21:02,688 --> 02:21:04,212
I'm still the best.

1292
02:21:17,136 --> 02:21:19,127
What brings you
to Monza, Monique?

1293
02:21:20,406 --> 02:21:23,705
- Business, of course.
- Of course.

1294
02:21:45,865 --> 02:21:48,026
Nino wonders if you're ready
to be beaten.

1295
02:21:49,535 --> 02:21:51,662
No one is ever ready for that.

1296
02:21:53,673 --> 02:21:56,540
You will never retire,
Jean-Pierre.

1297
02:21:56,709 --> 02:21:59,234
What does it matter to you, Monique?

1298
02:21:59,412 --> 02:22:00,436
- To me?
- Yeah.

1299
02:22:02,014 --> 02:22:05,177
As always, as a hero,
you're a good asset to the company.

1300
02:22:06,686 --> 02:22:10,986
Well, perhaps I'm tired
of being an asset for the company.

1301
02:22:11,157 --> 02:22:15,594
And tired too, of this farce we perform,
you and I, for public consumption.

1302
02:22:15,761 --> 02:22:20,255
But it doesn't really matter that you
are tired of these things, Jean-Pierre.

1303
02:22:20,433 --> 02:22:26,030
If you should decide not to continue
with the... The farce, as you call it...

1304
02:22:26,339 --> 02:22:28,398
...that, of course, is entirely up to you.

1305
02:22:29,809 --> 02:22:31,743
But it will make no difference.

1306
02:22:31,911 --> 02:22:33,503
As long as you're my husband...

1307
02:22:33,679 --> 02:22:37,206
...the company will have the prestige
of your name...

1308
02:22:37,483 --> 02:22:42,045
...and whether or not you ever step
into one of these again.

1309
02:22:42,822 --> 02:22:45,814
And you will always be my husband.

1310
02:22:46,325 --> 02:22:47,724
You know that, don't you?

1311
02:22:51,230 --> 02:22:55,690
This one,
she may be different to you...

1312
02:22:56,068 --> 02:22:58,229
...but not to me.

1313
02:22:58,671 --> 02:23:02,163
To me, she is just like all the others.

1314
02:23:03,075 --> 02:23:05,908
And we will always be married,
you and I.

1315
02:23:06,612 --> 02:23:08,102
Stay away from me, Monique.

1316
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:09,406
Let me alone, please.

1317
02:23:14,887 --> 02:23:18,084
Tell me. What terrible thing
have I done to you...

1318
02:23:18,257 --> 02:23:22,887
...that makes you want to nail me
to this absurd life we have together?

1319
02:23:24,096 --> 02:23:25,791
What terrible thing, Monique?

1320
02:23:32,605 --> 02:23:35,165
Do you think it's been worth it, Pat?

1321
02:23:35,341 --> 02:23:38,105
All the effort,
even if I win tomorrow?

1322
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:40,244
Worth it to you?

1323
02:23:41,414 --> 02:23:43,848
Only you can know that, Scott.

1324
02:23:44,617 --> 02:23:45,709
Yeah, I suppose so.

1325
02:23:48,454 --> 02:23:51,617
Well, let's go and have a party.

1326
02:23:51,791 --> 02:23:54,885
Scott, are you sure you want to go?

1327
02:23:55,061 --> 02:23:56,995
Wouldn't you rather rest?

1328
02:23:57,163 --> 02:24:00,758
After tomorrow, I shall be
a long time resting. Come on.

1329
02:24:05,071 --> 02:24:06,868
Have I thanked you?

1330
02:24:07,073 --> 02:24:08,131
For what?

1331
02:24:10,376 --> 02:24:11,775
For being here.

1332
02:24:21,087 --> 02:24:22,748
Thank you.

1333
02:24:31,430 --> 02:24:32,624
Hey, <i>sayonara</i>.

1334
02:24:32,798 --> 02:24:35,699
My goodness, Nino. I thought
they belonged to the Yamura boys.

1335
02:24:35,868 --> 02:24:37,699
I have them on temporary loan.

1336
02:24:37,870 --> 02:24:40,930
- Really? Two of them?
- They are very small.

1337
02:24:41,107 --> 02:24:43,405
See you later, maybe.

1338
02:25:45,037 --> 02:25:47,130
Can I buy you a drink?

1339
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:50,274
I don't drink.

1340
02:25:57,750 --> 02:25:59,809
I don't smoke.

1341
02:26:24,276 --> 02:26:25,971
The end?

1342
02:26:28,013 --> 02:26:29,878
The end.

1343
02:26:35,054 --> 02:26:38,717
I looked at the photographs last night.
Very good.

1344
02:26:39,892 --> 02:26:41,257
Thank you.

1345
02:26:41,427 --> 02:26:44,453
And what you wrote,
also very good.

1346
02:26:50,236 --> 02:26:54,673
Well, your work may be finished,
but mine is not.

1347
02:26:57,243 --> 02:26:59,108
It's time.

1348
02:26:59,445 --> 02:27:01,379
I don't want to see the race, Jean-Pierre.

1349
02:27:03,182 --> 02:27:04,581
Why not?

1350
02:27:05,784 --> 02:27:08,082
Because I'm ashamed.

1351
02:27:09,955 --> 02:27:11,923
Ashamed?

1352
02:27:13,058 --> 02:27:14,150
Of what?

1353
02:27:14,893 --> 02:27:17,726
Of what it's meant to be, I suppose.

1354
02:27:17,896 --> 02:27:19,591
The racing.

1355
02:27:20,099 --> 02:27:24,798
And now, knowing
what it means to you, the uncertainty.

1356
02:27:24,970 --> 02:27:28,235
I don't want to watch anymore.
Ever.

1357
02:27:33,646 --> 02:27:35,705
You're being very foolish, you know.

1358
02:27:36,882 --> 02:27:38,440
Let me be foolish, then.

1359
02:27:40,152 --> 02:27:44,088
I'm going to win today.
You don't want to miss that, do you?

1360
02:27:44,623 --> 02:27:47,387
Please, Jean-Pierre.
I don't want to go.

1361
02:27:56,001 --> 02:27:57,832
Well...

1362
02:28:02,308 --> 02:28:04,469
...to work, then.

1363
02:28:09,715 --> 02:28:11,080
I love you, Jean-Pierre.

1364
02:28:14,553 --> 02:28:15,577
And I you.

1365
02:28:21,126 --> 02:28:26,894
We'll have to discuss the consequences
of those terrible words, huh?

1366
02:28:51,757 --> 02:28:53,918
Hey, where were you last night?

1367
02:28:54,460 --> 02:28:57,088
- Where were you?
- Come here.

1368
02:29:03,836 --> 02:29:07,738
Am I expected to account
for my whereabouts at every moment?

1369
02:29:07,906 --> 02:29:10,739
- Am I?
- It is not the same thing.

1370
02:29:10,909 --> 02:29:12,604
You are a woman.

1371
02:29:13,512 --> 02:29:16,447
- I'm leaving you.
- Leaving? For how long?

1372
02:29:16,749 --> 02:29:19,980
For always, you fool.
Forever.

1373
02:29:26,024 --> 02:29:28,959
I met a boy, an American...

1374
02:29:29,128 --> 02:29:32,723
...who wants to go to the Greek islands
and dive for relics.

1375
02:29:33,866 --> 02:29:37,324
In the first place,
diving is a great bore.

1376
02:29:37,603 --> 02:29:40,504
How do you know?
Have you ever done it?

1377
02:29:40,672 --> 02:29:43,539
Some things one can tell
without doing them...

1378
02:29:43,709 --> 02:29:46,143
...that they will be a great bore.

1379
02:29:46,311 --> 02:29:49,144
Underwater is for fish, not people.

1380
02:29:49,314 --> 02:29:52,374
In the second place,
they are not relics at all.

1381
02:29:52,818 --> 02:29:55,753
I have on good authority
from a close friend...

1382
02:29:56,054 --> 02:30:00,115
...that these things are manufactured
and then dumped into the water...

1383
02:30:00,292 --> 02:30:03,284
...to be found by foolish
American boy tourists.

1384
02:30:03,462 --> 02:30:05,862
And the girls who are foolish enough
to go with them.

1385
02:30:06,398 --> 02:30:09,196
This is the most ridiculous thing
I ever heard.

1386
02:30:09,368 --> 02:30:13,236
I have it on very good authority
from a close friend.

1387
02:30:16,108 --> 02:30:17,871
Do you want me to stay?

1388
02:30:18,210 --> 02:30:20,906
You are old enough
to make your own decisions.

1389
02:30:22,781 --> 02:30:25,341
Then I'm going, all right?

1390
02:30:26,051 --> 02:30:29,578
Yes, I definitely think you should go
to the Greek islands...

1391
02:30:29,755 --> 02:30:32,349
...with your American boyfriend.

1392
02:30:32,524 --> 02:30:34,754
I think you should go to hell.

1393
02:30:55,013 --> 02:30:56,480
You gonna be in the pits today?

1394
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:12,296
<i>The last time this combined circuit</i>
<i>was used was in 1961.</i>

1395
02:31:12,464 --> 02:31:14,591
<i>There were objections</i>
<i>from drivers who thought...</i>

1396
02:31:14,766 --> 02:31:17,667
<i>... the light one-and-a-half liter</i>
<i>Formula 1 cars of that time...</i>

1397
02:31:17,836 --> 02:31:20,430
<i>... were not suitable for the strain</i>
<i>imposed by the banking.</i>

1398
02:31:20,606 --> 02:31:23,507
<i>Bearing in mind, the suspension</i>
<i>had to be a compromise setting...</i>

1399
02:31:23,675 --> 02:31:26,143
<i>... to allow for effective cornering</i>
<i>on the road section.</i>

1400
02:31:27,479 --> 02:31:29,276
<i>The bigger cars</i>
<i>of the present formula...</i>

1401
02:31:29,448 --> 02:31:32,611
<i>... should be better able</i>
<i>to stand up to the conditions</i>.

1402
02:31:36,054 --> 02:31:38,079
Hi, Pat.
How are you?

1403
02:31:38,257 --> 02:31:42,125
- Okay. You?
- All right.

1404
02:31:42,895 --> 02:31:45,295
Hope he beats you
by at least 10 laps today.

1405
02:31:46,865 --> 02:31:48,799
I'm glad you feel that way.

1406
02:31:49,034 --> 02:31:50,433
What if he doesn't?

1407
02:31:51,069 --> 02:31:52,934
We'll survive it one way or another.

1408
02:31:55,173 --> 02:31:56,367
Good luck.

1409
02:32:44,656 --> 02:32:47,420
<i>Scott Stoddard has 27 points</i>
<i>in the championship...</i>

1410
02:32:47,593 --> 02:32:49,493
<i>... exactly the same as Jean-Pierre Sarti.</i>

1411
02:32:49,661 --> 02:32:54,030
<i>In the lead with 28 points is Nino Barlini,</i>
<i>while Pete Aron has 26.</i>

1412
02:32:54,533 --> 02:32:58,162
<i>In just two hours, one of these men</i>
<i>will be the new world champion.</i>

1413
02:33:03,442 --> 02:33:04,636
<i>They're off.</i>

1414
02:33:07,679 --> 02:33:09,112
<i>Sarti is stalled.</i>

1415
02:33:09,281 --> 02:33:10,578
<i>He can't get away.</i>

1416
02:33:12,217 --> 02:33:17,086
Go away! You will disqualify me!
No, no! No!

1417
02:33:25,764 --> 02:33:27,527
<i>Sarti's away at last.</i>

1418
02:33:27,866 --> 02:33:30,027
<i>Leaders are onto the banking</i>
<i>for the first time...</i>

1419
02:33:30,202 --> 02:33:33,365
<i>... with Barlini's Ferrari in front</i>
<i>of Stoddard's BRM and Aron's Yamura.</i>

1420
02:33:33,538 --> 02:33:35,335
<i>Then Brabham, Gurney and Scarfiotti.</i>

1421
02:33:35,507 --> 02:33:40,171
<i>The order's Barlini, Stoddard,</i>
<i>Aron, Brabham, Gurney, Scarfiotti.</i>

1422
02:34:14,646 --> 02:34:15,943
<i>And tell me, Scott...</i>

1423
02:34:16,114 --> 02:34:20,278
<i>... are there any particular problems</i>
<i>in driving on the Monza banking?</i>

1424
02:34:20,819 --> 02:34:22,582
<i>The banking?</i>

1425
02:34:22,888 --> 02:34:26,654
<i>Well, it's just so damn rough up there,</i>
<i>that the car flicks all over the place.</i>

1426
02:34:26,825 --> 02:34:28,725
<i>We're never below 180, you know.</i>

1427
02:34:28,894 --> 02:34:31,260
<i>At that speed, your reactions</i>
<i>can barely keep up...</i>

1428
02:34:31,430 --> 02:34:33,591
<i>... with these sudden changes in direction.</i>

1429
02:34:33,765 --> 02:34:37,360
<i>The trouble is, the high centrifugal forces</i>
<i>push the car into the banking...</i>

1430
02:34:37,536 --> 02:34:39,595
<i>... and use up</i>
<i>all the suspension movement.</i>

1431
02:34:39,771 --> 02:34:42,797
<i>So, what you're driving</i>
<i>becomes a car with no springs.</i>

1432
02:34:42,974 --> 02:34:45,966
<i>It feels like you're getting a series</i>
<i>of punches in the back.</i>

1433
02:34:46,144 --> 02:34:47,975
<i>I hate it. I'm sick of pain.</i>

1434
02:34:48,246 --> 02:34:51,147
<i>But it's what the car is suffering</i>
<i>that really worries me.</i>

1435
02:34:51,316 --> 02:34:53,147
<i>Because no matter how the car</i>
<i>is set up...</i>

1436
02:34:53,318 --> 02:34:55,445
<i>... it bottoms at several places</i>
<i>on both bankings.</i>

1437
02:34:55,620 --> 02:34:58,885
<i>The underside of the car just comes</i>
<i>crashing down onto the biggest bumps.</i>

1438
02:34:59,057 --> 02:35:01,651
<i>Everything's shaking</i>
<i>and banging all the time.</i>

1439
02:35:01,827 --> 02:35:04,955
<i>Sometimes you could swear</i>
<i>the whole thing's falling to bits.</i>

1440
02:35:48,473 --> 02:35:50,134
<i>Well, none of us</i>
<i>like Monza very much.</i>

1441
02:35:50,308 --> 02:35:53,243
<i>It's so damn fast</i>
<i>and they run so close together...</i>

1442
02:35:53,411 --> 02:35:59,077
<i>... it requires fantastic concentration</i>
<i>and rather special skills.</i>

1443
02:35:59,251 --> 02:36:00,912
<i>Slipstreaming, for instance.</i>

1444
02:36:01,086 --> 02:36:06,683
<i>At speeds reaching 180 miles an hour,</i>
<i>race car's making a big hole in the air.</i>

1445
02:36:06,858 --> 02:36:11,955
<i>As the car goes through, the air rushes back</i>
<i>into the hole and creates a hell of a draft.</i>

1446
02:36:12,130 --> 02:36:15,258
<i>And that draft's strong enough to pull</i>
<i>a following car along at...</i>

1447
02:36:15,433 --> 02:36:18,596
<i>Oh, 10 miles</i>
<i>more than his usual top speed.</i>

1448
02:36:19,104 --> 02:36:22,164
<i>If yours is the last car in a bunch,</i>
<i>you can get a terrific tow.</i>

1449
02:36:22,340 --> 02:36:25,741
<i>You can back way off the gas pedal</i>
<i>and maintain the same speed.</i>

1450
02:36:26,178 --> 02:36:27,702
<i>Then you can put your foot down...</i>

1451
02:36:27,879 --> 02:36:32,680
<i>... pull out of the slipstream and maybe</i>
<i>overtake two, three cars at once.</i>

1452
02:36:32,851 --> 02:36:36,309
<i>The only thing to do here is to drive</i>
<i>just as fast as you know how...</i>

1453
02:36:36,488 --> 02:36:38,149
<i>... and hope your car doesn't break.</i>

1454
02:38:26,564 --> 02:38:29,362
<i>At the end of the fifth lap,</i>
<i>Barlini's in the lead by five seconds.</i>

1455
02:38:29,968 --> 02:38:32,903
<i>Now both Stoddard and Aron</i>
<i>have lost the Ferrari's slipstream.</i>

1456
02:38:33,071 --> 02:38:35,869
<i>And they're dropping back</i>
<i>in their great dice for second place.</i>

1457
02:39:02,033 --> 02:39:06,970
<i>Coming up the main straight is number four,</i>
<i>Jean-Pierre Sarti's Ferrari in 14th place.</i>

1458
02:39:07,138 --> 02:39:10,107
<i>With 10 laps gone</i>
<i>and only 18 seconds behind Barlini...</i>

1459
02:39:10,275 --> 02:39:13,574
<i>... after losing nearly half a minute</i>
<i>when his engine stalled at the start.</i>

1460
02:39:13,745 --> 02:39:17,408
<i>With 40 laps to go, Sarti could still</i>
<i>catch the leader and win the race.</i>

1461
02:40:03,661 --> 02:40:06,129
Are you never afraid?

1462
02:40:06,831 --> 02:40:08,458
Not ever.

1463
02:40:08,633 --> 02:40:10,191
Why?

1464
02:40:11,369 --> 02:40:16,170
Because I am immortal.

1465
02:40:24,849 --> 02:40:28,114
Why do you drive racing cars?

1466
02:40:28,753 --> 02:40:31,586
Or do you not think about it?

1467
02:40:31,856 --> 02:40:35,792
Well, Mr. Yamura,
I don't think there's one of us...

1468
02:40:35,960 --> 02:40:39,555
...who doesn't ask himself
at least once in the middle of a race:

1469
02:40:39,731 --> 02:40:42,199
"What the hell am I doing here?"

1470
02:40:42,467 --> 02:40:48,133
Of course, when it's over, we conveniently
forget that we ask ourselves that question.

1471
02:40:49,074 --> 02:40:51,338
I think about it.

1472
02:40:51,576 --> 02:40:54,067
There are a lot of reasons, I don't know.

1473
02:40:54,245 --> 02:40:57,612
Maybe to do something...

1474
02:40:57,782 --> 02:41:03,015
...that brings you so close to
the possibility of death and to survive it...

1475
02:41:03,188 --> 02:41:07,318
...is to feel life and living
so much more intensely.

1476
02:41:18,336 --> 02:41:21,567
- Be careful there, it's slippery.
- Okay.

1477
02:41:23,842 --> 02:41:26,140
Can you manage all right?

1478
02:41:30,381 --> 02:41:32,645
I'm all right. It's okay.

1479
02:41:35,220 --> 02:41:36,881
I'll get Thompson to bring lunch up.

1480
02:41:37,055 --> 02:41:39,615
- I'll eat downstairs, Mom.
- You can't go downstairs again.

1481
02:41:39,791 --> 02:41:42,783
Look, I'm getting up the stairs,
I can certainly get down them.

1482
02:41:44,996 --> 02:41:48,227
If worse comes to the worse, I can
always slide down the banisters.

1483
02:41:48,399 --> 02:41:50,959
- Right?
- Yes.

1484
02:42:29,741 --> 02:42:31,834
This isn't good,
you know, what I feel now.

1485
02:42:32,010 --> 02:42:33,307
What do you feel?

1486
02:42:33,478 --> 02:42:37,346
That I would almost rather stay
here with you than get into the car.

1487
02:42:37,515 --> 02:42:39,312
Almost.

1488
02:42:39,617 --> 02:42:44,281
I suppose at my age, one moves
slowly from one habit to the next.

1489
02:42:44,656 --> 02:42:45,645
I must go, darling.

1490
02:43:34,439 --> 02:43:36,407
<i>There's Barlini on his 17th lap.</i>

1491
02:43:36,574 --> 02:43:39,839
<i>His Ferrari is just a bit too fast,</i>
<i>even for Pete Aron's Yamura...</i>

1492
02:43:40,011 --> 02:43:41,444
<i>... and Scott Stoddard's BRM.</i>

1493
02:43:41,613 --> 02:43:43,274
<i>They're in second and third places.</i>

1494
02:43:43,448 --> 02:43:47,509
<i>There's a splendid scrap for fourth place,</i>
<i>with Tim Randolph in the second Yamura...</i>

1495
02:43:47,685 --> 02:43:51,553
<i>... just ahead of Dan Gurney in the Eagle,</i>
<i>and Bob Turner in the other BRM.</i>

1496
02:44:19,284 --> 02:44:20,842
<i>As they sweep around the banking...</i>

1497
02:44:21,019 --> 02:44:24,216
<i>... Sarti's gonna catch up with the three cars</i>
<i>fighting for fourth place.</i>

1498
02:44:24,389 --> 02:44:28,257
<i>He's passed Tim Randolph, now watch</i>
<i>him go underneath Gurney in the Eagle.</i>

1499
02:44:28,426 --> 02:44:31,327
<i>Yes, he's passed him, and now</i>
<i>he's passing Bob Turner in the BRM.</i>

1500
02:44:31,496 --> 02:44:32,724
<i>He's fourth. Sarti's fourth.</i>

1501
02:44:33,364 --> 02:44:35,924
<i>There are three cars in front.</i>
<i>When Sarti's lapped them...</i>

1502
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:39,763
<i>... he'll only have Aron and Stoddard</i>
<i>between him and the leader, Barlini.</i>

1503
02:45:56,381 --> 02:45:58,611
<i>We've just heard</i>
<i>there's been an accident.</i>

1504
02:46:00,451 --> 02:46:04,353
<i>It's Sarti. Sarti's Ferrari</i>
<i>has gone clean over the north banking...</i>

1505
02:46:04,522 --> 02:46:07,685
<i>... and landed at the side</i>
<i>of the track below. Then it caught fire.</i>

1506
02:46:25,543 --> 02:46:27,340
Oh, Jean-Pierre!

1507
02:46:29,981 --> 02:46:31,505
Oh, Jean-Pierre.

1508
02:46:31,682 --> 02:46:34,310
Jean-Pierre. Oh, Jean-Pierre.

1509
02:46:34,685 --> 02:46:36,448
Oh, Jean-Pierre.

1510
02:46:36,621 --> 02:46:40,921
No. No!
No, Jean-Pierre!

1511
02:46:42,126 --> 02:46:44,424
Jean-Pierre. Jean-Pierre!

1512
02:46:44,796 --> 02:46:48,232
No! Jean-Pierre!

1513
02:46:49,667 --> 02:46:53,660
Jean-Pierre.
Jean-Pierre! Jean-Pierre.

1514
02:46:56,908 --> 02:46:57,932
Jean-Pierre.

1515
02:47:02,747 --> 02:47:05,011
Jean-Pierre!

1516
02:47:05,283 --> 02:47:07,444
What do you want?
Is this what you want?

1517
02:47:07,752 --> 02:47:12,382
Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?

1518
02:47:46,691 --> 02:47:49,524
<i>The</i> Commendatore <i>is showing</i>
<i>a black flag to his drivers.</i>

1519
02:47:49,694 --> 02:47:52,128
<i>He's withdrawing the whole Ferrari team.</i>

1520
02:47:52,296 --> 02:47:54,730
<i>I don't think it's been done like this</i>
<i>for 40 years.</i>

1521
02:47:54,899 --> 02:47:57,834
<i>The Alfa Romeo team manager</i>
<i>did the same thing once in the '20s...</i>

1522
02:47:58,002 --> 02:48:01,403
<i>... when Antonio Ascari was killed</i>
<i>in the French Grand Prix.</i>

1523
02:48:01,572 --> 02:48:05,303
<i>He showed the black flag to Campari and</i>
<i>Brilli-Peri when the Alfas were in the lead.</i>

1524
02:48:17,855 --> 02:48:22,087
<i>Here comes Barlini into the pits now</i>
<i>in response to the black-flag signal.</i>

1525
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:24,592
- Jean-Pierre?
<i>- He'll have to be told the news...</i>

1526
02:48:24,762 --> 02:48:26,161
<i>... of his team leader's death.</i>

1527
02:48:26,731 --> 02:48:30,565
<i>And this tragic race is over</i>
<i>for the young Sicilian.</i>

1528
02:48:30,801 --> 02:48:32,325
<i>In the lead are Aron and Stoddard.</i>

1529
02:48:32,503 --> 02:48:35,939
<i>They've just gone past the pits,</i>
<i>side by side, fighting for the lead.</i>

1530
02:49:00,498 --> 02:49:02,432
<i>Last lap now.</i>
<i>Stoddard or Aron?</i>

1531
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:05,296
<i>They're still neck and neck,</i>
<i>wheel to wheel, the whole way.</i>

1532
02:49:49,013 --> 02:49:51,413
<i>Stoddard's in front as they</i>
<i>come into the last corner.</i>

1533
02:49:51,582 --> 02:49:53,413
<i>Aron, in the Yamura,</i>
<i>is right on his tail.</i>

1534
02:49:53,584 --> 02:49:55,745
<i>He can still beat the BRM to the flag.</i>

1535
02:50:16,941 --> 02:50:20,172
<i>It was Aron. The Yamura</i>
<i>was just a wheel in front of the BRM.</i>

1536
02:50:20,344 --> 02:50:22,869
<i>Aron is the new world champion.</i>

1537
02:50:23,047 --> 02:50:25,413
<i>It looked as if</i>
<i>the Yamura was just in front.</i>

1538
02:50:25,583 --> 02:50:28,643
<i>Aron is the winner.</i>
<i>Aron is the new world champion.</i>

1539
02:50:28,819 --> 02:50:33,586
<i>Pete Aron of the United States has won</i>
<i>the Italian Grand Prix for Yamura of Japan.</i>

1540
02:50:33,758 --> 02:50:36,124
<i>And Scott Stoddard</i>
<i>in the BRM was second.</i>

1541
02:50:36,293 --> 02:50:39,990
<i>What a race.</i>
<i>What a tremendous race.</i>

1542
02:51:12,463 --> 02:51:13,657
Sarti?

1543
02:52:01,746 --> 02:52:05,546
<i>Pete Aron is greeted as the winner</i>
<i>of the Italian Grand Prix...</i>

1544
02:52:05,716 --> 02:52:08,981
<i>... and this gives him</i>
<i>the World Drivers' Championship.</i>

1545
02:52:09,153 --> 02:52:14,921
<i>A great triumph for this determined</i>
<i>American driver and Izo Yamura of Japan...</i>

1546
02:52:15,092 --> 02:52:19,358
<i>... whose cars have challenged and</i>
<i>conquered the might of Formula 1 teams...</i>

1547
02:52:19,530 --> 02:52:22,829
<i>... in spite of all the years of experience</i>
<i>and development behind them.</i>

1548
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:26,834
<i>But it's a sad end to this dramatic season</i>
<i>of battles for the championship.</i>

1549
02:52:27,705 --> 02:52:31,903
<i>The tragic, fatal accident</i>
<i>to the great Jean-Pierre Sarti...</i>

1550
02:52:32,076 --> 02:52:34,340
<i>... has cast a shadow over the race.</i>

1551
02:52:34,512 --> 02:52:38,141
<i>And everyone who knew him or</i>
<i>saw him drive will find it hard to accept...</i>

1552
02:52:38,315 --> 02:52:42,547
<i>... that his great skill</i>
<i>and tremendous personality is lost to us.</i>

1553
02:52:42,887 --> 02:52:46,948
<i>I'm sure the last thing either Pete Aron</i>
<i>or Izo Yamura would have wished...</i>

1554
02:52:47,591 --> 02:52:49,024
<i>... is for it to end this way</i>.

1555
02:52:57,601 --> 02:53:02,129
<i>Pete, do you ever get tired of the driving?</i>

1556
02:53:02,306 --> 02:53:05,104
<i>Lately, I sometimes get very tired.</i>

1557
02:53:05,276 --> 02:53:08,677
<i>You know what I mean?</i>
<i>Very tired.</i>

1558
02:55:49,807 --> 02:55:51,798
