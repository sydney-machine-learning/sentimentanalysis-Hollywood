I was walking along the Embankment.

And he was swimming
in the dirty water,
with his trousers on

and a see-through nylon shirt.

1073
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:53,273
First of all, I thought he was
one of these health perverts.

1074
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,948
Then I noticed he was keeping
himself away from the shore,

1075
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,630
tiring himself out, you see,
getting weaker and weaker.

01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,668
Then the river police
came in a launch,

1077
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,235

he'd gone under.
