00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:13,274
<i>Car 42, you've been in pursuit</i>
<i>for two hours.</i>

44
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:15,874
<i>Another five minutes,</i>
<i>and you'll be in Arizona.</i>

45
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:19,474
<i>Yeah, and we're gonna stay in pursuit</i>
<i>until we catch him.</i>

46
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:22,773
<i>It didn't take us that long</i>
<i>to catch Dillinger.</i>

47
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:47,369
Hi, guys.

48
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:00,067
- You're two hours late.
- I'm sorry.

49
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:02,097
Where the hell you been?

50
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:05,066
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,565
Fuel-injection system...
It's driving me crazy.

52
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:13,165
I'm really sorry I'm late, but one
of my hamsters had an anxiety attack.

53
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:15,245
I couldn't leave him
until he was settled down.

54
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:18,364
He was acting so crazy.
He ate a piece of tail.

55
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:21,064
And Henrietta wasn't even
bothering him.

56
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:23,562
Then he ate his treadmill.

57
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:30,262
They got vets for that.
We got other things to worry about.

58
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,561
Hamsters are a big responsibility.

59
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:36,361
Let me paint you a mental picture,
all right, Victor?

60
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:39,860
I want you to think of your hamsters
as a little army...

61
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,960
marching along on a treadmill...

62
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,459
running their little legs off,
running as fast as they can...

63
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:48,659
making that engine just
purr right along the road.

64
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:53,458
Oh, J.J. What a wonderful way
to put it.

65
00:04:56,158 --> 00:05:00,257
Wouldn't it be great if we could share
winning the Cannonball with them?

66
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:05,157
That would be a real team effort...
you, me, the hamsters and him.

67
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:24,153
Don't start with him.
I don't want to talk about him.

68
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:27,952
- If you need any help...
- I don't want to talk about him.

69
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,951
- Sir James!
- Oh, my God. You again?

70
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:40,051
Fenderbaum, do me a favor.

71
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,250
You're drawing flies.
Get the hell out of here.

72
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,750
Wait a minute, Greek.
Only thing I want to know is...

73
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,449
how are you figuring the odds
on this Cannonball cockamamie?

74
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,249
It takes brilliance
and years of hard work...

75
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:53,249
and you wouldn't understand
any part of that.

76
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:56,248
Do me a favor.
A race is a race, right?

77
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:59,148
The only thing you gotta do
in the Cannonball is drive steady...

78
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:01,348
stay out of trouble
and have a good cover.

79
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:04,547
3,000 miles averaging
85 miles an hour.

80
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:06,239
Do you know what that is?

81
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:09,347
You want to talk
or do you want to bet?

82
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:12,946
Anti-radar paint,
turbocharged, J.J.

83
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:16,522
Nobody can stop us now.
Nobody.

84
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:35,642
What are you, some kind of nut?
Who do you think you are?

85
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,841
I am Captain Chaos.

86
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:47,140
And this...
This is my faithful companion, Cato.

87
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:49,340
Say hello, Cato.

88
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,239
Been a cop long?

89
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,739
Funny!
You wanna talk or you wanna bet?

90
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,878
- You got 50 to 1.
- And you know what you got?

91
00:07:02,027 --> 00:07:03,938
You got yourself a bet.

92
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:07,233
Twenty big large ones.

93
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:09,750
That's a million dollars.

94
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:11,637
If you win.

95
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:15,935
I don't know if you know my partner.
Jamie, you remember Jimmy the Greek.

96
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,436
Jamie Blake.

97
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,834
You used to drive
that Formula One...

98
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:24,034
when high-button shoes
were in style.

99
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:26,434
Let me tell you something, Greek.

100
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:28,225
We got a secret weapon.

101
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:32,133
- God is our copilot.
- You'll need him.

102
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:39,332
"God is our copilot"?

103
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:41,602
- Remember our car?
- Yeah.

104
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:44,034
- Two seats?
- Two seats.

105
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,031
Where's he gonna sit?
Where?

106
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:51,930
Listen to me, El Porko.

107
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:56,029
We're not in the Indianapolis 500.
We can't have a car with numbers on it.

108
00:07:56,471 --> 00:07:59,829
- We have to camouflage the car somehow.
- Like what, J.J.?

109
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:02,529
How about a limousine
with diplomatic plates?

110
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:07,228
I know. A bloodmobile.

111
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:09,828
They'd never stop
a bloodmobile, would they?

112
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:12,826
Ice cream truck!
An ice cream truck!

113
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,946
You know. They got to get there
before it melts.

114
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,525
Terrific.

115
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:22,725
- We're out of beer, Victor.
- Sorry.

116
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:26,505
Take it easy! You're acting crazy
since this Cannonball thing!

117
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:28,924
I'm gonna pull in here
and get some beer, all right?

118
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,123
How about an armored personnel carrier?
They wouldn't stop that, would they?

119
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:54,220
Hey, don't bother to park.
I'll be right out.

120
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:07,867
Thank you.

121
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:10,817
We could get a black Trans Am.
No, that's been done.

122
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:38,981
Hello, Mother.
I trust you've had a pleasant day.

123
00:09:39,258 --> 00:09:41,713
A nightmare.
A living nightmare.

124
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:43,912
You are killing me, Seymour...

125
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:48,412
killing me a slow death
with this idiot spy business.

126
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:52,411
- Mother, you don't understand.
- What is there to understand?

127
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:56,211
I'm looking at my son,
Seymour Goldfarb, jr...

128
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,310
son of Seymour Goldfarb,
God rest his soul...

129
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,610
and heir to the Goldfarb Girdles
fortune.

130
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,608
And what is he doing?

131
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:06,708
Walking around, acting...

132
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:10,320
like he was some goy movie star
named Roger Moore.

133
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:13,007
And for this I sent you
to the best schools?

134
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:16,742
For this I'm spending 8,000
on orthodontia work?

135
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:20,106
For this I'm going broke
paying that Beverly Hills analyst?

136
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:21,706
And now...

137
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:22,906
this.

138
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:27,805
The sleep-in maid found it
under your pillow this morning.

139
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:30,105
What is the meaning of this?

140
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:32,804
The meaning, Mother dear,
is a quick death.

141
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:35,704
I warned you not to interfere
in my affairs.

142
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:39,143
Seymour, put that away.
It's liable to go off.

143
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,603
I'm terribly sorry, Mother...

144
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:44,003
but you know too much.

145
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:46,003
You see, in my business...

146
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:50,102
even the deepest family relationships
aren't worth a farthing.

147
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:52,178
Farthing, schmarthing.

148
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:57,447
Zie gezunt, Mama.

149
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,499
Where did I go wrong?

150
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:04,999
You know something, Mama?
You're too jewish.

151
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,298
Of course, we could always go
with a nice, plain-jane Chevy...

152
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:11,898
with a truckload
of Sidewinder missiles.

153
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:14,697
J. J., maybe you should slow this down
just a little bit.

154
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:18,197
- I can't hear you.
- I said, you're making waves.

155
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:21,297
- You're bothering the people.
- What the hell does going too fast...

156
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:24,296
got to do with being
in the Cannonball?

157
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:27,596
J. J., you're making very big waves.

158
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:29,996
How are ya?

159
00:11:41,894 --> 00:11:45,893
You guys are lucky.
You tore the heck out of that boat.

160
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:48,793
- You all right, Victor?
- Oh, I'm fine, J.J.

161
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:51,892
It only hurts when I point.

162
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:54,092
You know, maybe
it would've been better...

163
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:57,090
if you didn't pay
so much attention to those girls.

164
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,190
- Nobody's perfect.
- That's true.

165
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,190
Nobody's perfect...

166
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,790
but him.

167
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:06,089
Sorry.

168
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:07,889
How far is it
to the hospital?

169
00:12:07,989 --> 00:12:09,839
- About ten miles.
- Oh, yeah?

170
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:11,788
How long will it take us
to get there?

171
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:13,288
About four or five minutes.

172
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:16,288
You can smoke through traffic like
shot through a gun in this thing.

173
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:13,058
Camel.

174
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:15,669
Not the Camel, schmuck. Winston.

175
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,783
Starting tomorrow, you and George
will be riding in the car with me.

176
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:52,063
Yes, sir.

177
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:02,961
How goes your driving, my brother?

178
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:05,261
Allah be praised, dear sister.

179
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:09,360
My speed is rivaled only by
the lightning bolts from the heavens.

180
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:17,459
And I suppose you still intend
to go through that race...

181
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:19,459
with the infidel Americans.

182
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:21,559
Cannonball will fall...

183
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,858
to the forces of Islam!

184
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:27,158
My dear sister, I pledge it!

185
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:29,857
Drink! Drink!

186
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:32,257
- The car will be there, correct?
- Yes, Mr. Compton.

187
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:34,457
Don't forget to cancel
the board meeting on Monday.

188
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:37,856
I'm going to spend a week
in Spain at the castle.

189
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:41,056
- Yes, Mr. Compton.
- I want you to find an old friend...

190
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,156
a Mr. Shakey Finch.

191
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:46,754
He is the finest long-distance
motorcycle rider in this nation.

192
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,954
- You got it?
- Yes, Mr. Compton.

193
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:54,453
Mr. Compton, the board has asked me
to express their concern one more time.

194
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,553
- Please reconsider.
- Not possible, Arthur.

195
00:15:57,653 --> 00:16:00,552
The board will have to permit me
this one indulgence...

196
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,152
to my ego.

197
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:10,751
~ <i>I've gotta be free</i> ~

198
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:14,541
~ <i>I've gotta be me</i> ~

199
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:16,248
~ <i>To live</i> ~

200
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:27,590
~ <i>Got to be free</i> ~

201
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,542
- Boy, ain't he something?
- Are you kidding?

202
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:32,788
That is the dumbest thing I've seen
since that dimwit...

203
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,747
tried to jump the Grand Canyon.

204
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,545
He's still on our ass.

205
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:43,045
I don't think...
I don't think...

206
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:44,945
I don't think he's a brother either.

207
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,744
Don't you worry, son.
I'm gonna lose him up here at the motel.

208
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:51,844
Hey, I remember.
There's a spot...

209
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,043
There's a spot right in back...

210
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:57,043
and it's a perfect spot to hide.

211
00:16:57,243 --> 00:16:59,543
All right. Wonderful, wonderful.

212
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,243
- Take... Take...
- Left.

213
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:03,242
Oh, hell. Take a left.

214
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,442
I can't see shit, can you?

215
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:10,841
No problem, son.
No problem.

216
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,641
What was that?

217
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,339
That's... That's... That's...

218
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:32,530
perfect.

219
00:17:33,064 --> 00:17:34,536
That's better than hiding...

220
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:37,236
- That's better than hiding it out back.
- I know.

221
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,336
But the only problem
we got now...

222
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:41,836
is we have to go and retune it.

223
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,236
All right?
Let's go get a beer first.

224
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:46,935
Yeah, let's go get... Let's... Beer.

225
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,934
I'd like to thank Mona Carson
of Westport...

226
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,333
for that wonderful combination
of hemp sandwiches...

227
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:57,034
and wood chip consomme.

228
00:17:57,234 --> 00:18:01,033
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

229
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,233
This is a titty turn...

230
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:05,433
terrific turnout for the meeting.

231
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:07,732
- Yes, terrific.
- He led the campaign...

232
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:12,132
to ban the use of electric toothbrushes
during peak load hours.

233
00:18:13,931 --> 00:18:16,131
I suppose you...

234
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:18,131
came here to hear me speak.

235
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,930
No, not really.
I'm into trees.

236
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,030
Trees.

237
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,679
Friends of Nature love trees,
you know...

238
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,629
so I come to the meetings.

239
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,417
That's very interesting.

240
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:35,721
I love anybody who loves trees.

241
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:39,327
They happen to be
a great passion of mine.

242
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:41,926
You know what I like
best about trees?

243
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:44,916
- No, what?
- That you can lie under them...

244
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:47,626
on a moonlit night
with the breeze blowing...

245
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,290
ball your brains out.

246
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:52,625
Mr. Arthur J. Foyt.

247
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,524
Mr. Foyt.

248
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:04,863
Give that sucker some juice.

249
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:10,005
The only thing hiding it...
hiding it... hiding it in the pool...

250
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:13,122
did was make it pretty.

251
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:15,522
It ain't running worth a shit.
And it's wet!

252
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,221
I know that. Just hit it
one more time, all right?

253
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:23,221
Hold it! Hold it!
I know what's wrong.

254
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:25,320
Don't think for a minute...

255
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,720
that we in Washington...

256
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,518
don't appreciate your Mothers' March...

257
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:35,072
to ban the sale
of colored toilet paper...

258
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,017
to help reduce irritation...

259
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:40,517
of the rectum.

260
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,816
But today...

261
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:48,016
I want to direct my remarks...

262
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:49,616
to an old...

263
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:52,715
and familiar enemy...

264
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:55,115
the automobile.

265
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:57,715
One more time.
Let me hear it.

266
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:07,213
It reminds me of a poem...

267
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:09,013
I wrote.

268
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:12,113
"The automobile, the automobile..."

269
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,809
Are you all right?

270
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:31,509
They picked on the wrong one
this time!

271
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:34,308
I guarantee
they're gonna pay for this...

272
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:37,008
because when the going gets tough,
the tough get going.

273
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:42,707
She's running good now, buddy.

274
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:45,007
I still think
we ought to paint it.

275
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:48,307
If we're gonna paint it, let's go ahead
and Midasize it, all right?

276
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:54,206
There's the motel.

277
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:57,105
The Cannonballers have the parking lot
all jammed up.

278
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:59,905
Man, I can't handle this traffic.

279
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:02,705
Hold on to your lunch pail.
This may get a little weird.

280
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:04,004
Wait a minute.

281
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:07,104
Slow down!

282
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:17,402
You the one running this flea bag?

283
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:19,736
- Where are the hookers?
- What?

284
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,202
Hookers, man.
Where are the hookers?

285
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:23,833
Excuse me.

286
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,100
- Hello, Mad Dog.
- Hey, J.J.

287
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,680
You probably didn't realize this,
but the parking lot's outside.

288
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,599
Yeah, I know.
Brakes went out.

289
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:34,999
- You think you're the president?
- Well...

290
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:37,699
let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

291
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:40,998
We feel terrible about it.
And if they can't take a joke...

292
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:46,397
Thank goodness. We just had
a terrible accident.

293
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,497
We'd like to help you,
but we're off duty.

294
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:51,097
This man looks bad.
Maybe he's dead.

295
00:21:51,197 --> 00:21:54,396
Then you should call the coroner.
J. J., he don't look too good.

296
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,228
- I think he just had his bell rung.
- Can't you do something?

297
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,298
You're professionals.

298
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,295
This is our day off.

299
00:22:04,452 --> 00:22:08,228
Will you guys do something?
This man's life is hanging by a thread.

300
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,666
You have to be scientific. It could go
up the nostrils, affect the sinuses.

301
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,032
That's true.

302
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:34,747
There.
Don't bother about the bill.

303
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:37,243
Just give him
a couple of enemas...

304
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,589
and call me in the morning.

305
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:43,088
- Hi. How's it going?
- Perfect.

306
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:46,088
We'd like two singles.
J.J. McClure, Victor Prinzim.

307
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:47,611
I'll be in the bar.

308
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:50,887
I always like a couple drinks
right after surgery.

309
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:00,166
I wonder why that guy
parked his truck in the lobby.

310
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:02,686
Only in America.
Get me 12 suites.

311
00:23:02,886 --> 00:23:05,185
- Better yet, the entire floor.
- Yes, sir.

312
00:23:07,494 --> 00:23:09,030
Too much couscous.

313
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:11,984
I would sure as H
like to get my hands...

314
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:14,984
on those Hell's Angels
who were driving that truck.

315
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:18,182
But you know, it's probably
just as well...

316
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:21,582
because I am a wild bull
when I lose my temper.

317
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,481
I love wild bulls.

318
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:32,753
It's really funny that you should...
Oh, my God. It's them.

319
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,460
- "Them" who?
- Those Hell's Angels.

320
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:36,722
They could be part
of a terrorist group.

321
00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:38,280
I don't know.

322
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,268
This place is filling up...

323
00:23:42,738 --> 00:23:45,279
with some real hoodlums.

324
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:48,278
Do you see anything weird back there?

325
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,442
I'm gonna find out.

326
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:05,586
I don't understand why it's
so difficult for you to find a doctor.

327
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:09,875
It's very, very hard. It's not easy
finding a doctor to take off like that.

328
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,485
- Dr. Gay doesn't even leave his house.
- You don't understand.

329
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:15,773
If you're going to win and you're
driving an ambulance, you need a doctor.

330
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:20,373
- What does Dr. Gay do?
- He's my shrink.

331
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:22,440
- He was committed yesterday.
- Why?

332
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:25,172
He was smoking bananas.

333
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:28,271
He gets very upset
when he talks to him.

334
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,071
So do I.

335
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:34,707
Sorry.
I don't want fruit in my drink.

336
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,275
Congratulations.

337
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:42,469
Here's to you.
Good luck.

338
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:47,166
You dumb shits.

339
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:49,069
They haven't got a chance.

340
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:50,768
You know what?

341
00:24:50,968 --> 00:24:54,268
I think I'm gonna call the Greek
and put another 10,000 on us.

342
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,009
What about those two?

343
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,067
Maybe one of those beauties
could be our patient.

344
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:05,620
Both of them could be.

345
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:08,066
I could be very patient
with those patients.

346
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:11,530
They're very lick...
very likeable.

347
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:15,064
Tell you what. Let's go over there
and talk to them.

348
00:25:15,364 --> 00:25:17,064
- Okay.
- I'll do all the talking.

349
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:20,682
You just think about the doctor.

350
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:32,961
- Good evening, ladies.
- Hello.

351
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:36,661
My name is J.J. McClure, and this is
Victor Prinzim, my executive assistant.

352
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:38,761
- Hi.
- I'll do the talking, Victor.

353
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:41,060
Terrorists, my dimpled ass.

354
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,560
These people make terrorists look like
the Sisters of Charity.

355
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,547
These guys are Cannonballers.

356
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,664
What is that, a bowling team?

357
00:25:53,835 --> 00:25:56,478
As you probably know, we're
the favorites to win the Cannonball...

358
00:25:56,578 --> 00:25:58,478
and I was wondering if one of you
or both of you...

359
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:00,357
might like to ride
in the winning vehicle.

360
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:02,957
That would be very exciting.

361
00:26:03,057 --> 00:26:04,557
Exciting.

362
00:26:04,657 --> 00:26:06,757
But we're Cannonballers ourselves,
thank you.

363
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,918
They're Cannonballers.

364
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,755
As for the winning vehicle...

365
00:26:10,955 --> 00:26:13,055
we'll just have to wait and see.

366
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:14,554
You haven't seen our equipment.

367
00:26:17,054 --> 00:26:18,219
Equipment?

368
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:54,466
Don't tell me your name.

369
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:56,407
Let me guess.

370
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:13,645
I'll just call you Beauty, okay?

371
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:15,595
That's nice.

372
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:17,245
Thank you.

373
00:27:17,656 --> 00:27:18,944
Sit down.

374
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:24,944
Are you one of those volleyballers?

375
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:27,343
Cannonballers. No.

376
00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:28,943
Why are you dressed like that?

377
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:31,943
Humanitarian reasons.

378
00:27:32,143 --> 00:27:35,142
I'm a wealthy philanthropist.

379
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:37,442
Me and my partner ride around
in an ambulance...

380
00:27:37,642 --> 00:27:40,376
Looking for accidents,
trying to help people.

381
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:44,141
I don't think we were put
on this earth to hurt people.

382
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:46,141
I think we were put
on this earth to...

383
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:47,840
help people.

384
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,340
- That's beautiful.
- Thank you.

385
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,240
You must be a sensitive person.

386
00:27:53,561 --> 00:27:54,539
I try to be.

387
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:57,239
I bet you're a fan of Rod McKuen.

388
00:27:57,614 --> 00:27:59,039
I listen to him every night.

389
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:04,237
I'm into trees.
Have you ever heard of Joyce Kilmer?

390
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:06,637
She wrote a terrific poem
about a tree.

391
00:28:06,837 --> 00:28:07,837
He.

392
00:28:08,516 --> 00:28:09,336
Who?

393
00:28:09,636 --> 00:28:12,036
- He.
- He's a she?

394
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:13,336
She's a he.

395
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:18,435
Well, he wrote a really terrific
poem about a tree.

396
00:28:19,935 --> 00:28:22,634
- You know what I like best about trees?
- No, what?

397
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,534
That you can lie under them
on a moonlit night...

398
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:27,734
the leaves gently
blowing in the trees...

399
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:31,333
Sorry.

400
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,233
It's all right.
What were you saying about trees?

401
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:39,232
I was saying,
what I like best about trees...

402
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:43,431
is that, on a moonlit night
you can lie under them...

403
00:28:43,674 --> 00:28:46,021
with the leaves gently blowing...

404
00:28:46,128 --> 00:28:49,231
Hey, J. J., you'll never believe
what just happened to him.

405
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:51,941
- I don't want to talk about it.
- He had the most wonderful time...

406
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,730
I don't want to talk about him.
Victor, Beauty. Beauty, Victor.

407
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,928
- Hello, Victor.
- You really are.

408
00:28:58,228 --> 00:29:00,918
- Do you want to hear about the doc?
- He's telling me about the doctor.

409
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:02,838
- Oh, it's about the doctor.
- It's really important.

410
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:05,427
- We need a doc for the ambulance.
- It'll keep.

411
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:07,227
I'll leave you two alone.

412
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:10,576
- But listen, I think you should hear...
- It'll keep!

413
00:29:11,027 --> 00:29:13,584
- It's really important.
- I want to talk to her.

414
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:15,426
Who?

415
00:29:17,926 --> 00:29:19,386
Now do you want to hear
about the doc?

416
00:29:19,486 --> 00:29:21,825
- No!
- It'll keep.

417
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:27,324
Hey, Brad, old buddy!
How the hell are you?

418
00:29:28,924 --> 00:29:31,424
My God, it is you.
Hello, Shakey!

419
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:36,723
Shakey, it's kind of tough
to get close to you.

420
00:29:36,923 --> 00:29:39,223
Last time I saw you,
you were a bit more svelte.

421
00:29:39,423 --> 00:29:42,183
Yeah, well, what can I tell you?
In the pizza business, when it's slow...

422
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:45,022
you tend to eat the inventory.

423
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:47,421
But that's not good for the Cannonball.
You know that.

424
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,821
You don't need a motorcycle.
You need the Super Chief.

425
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:54,121
Even with the extra tonnage,
I'm still the best there is.

426
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,419
Yeah? Well, I'll tell you what.

427
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:59,819
I got a throttle that's been sticking.
Why don't you fix that?

428
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,918
Boss, this is the biggest coup...

429
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:05,618
in the history
of the safety enforcement unit.

430
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:09,217
We're gonna blow this
Cannonball thing wide open...

431
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:11,717
and then we're gonna hit congress
for a real budget...

432
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:14,317
that will allow us to play
some real hardball.

433
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,516
I mean, this is
our Three Mile Island...

434
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:18,816
and Love Canal combined.

435
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:25,315
- What's wrong?
- Look at the chicks.

436
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:28,315
- What is it?
- Look at the chicks!

437
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:32,814
If we were Methodists...

438
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:36,314
what a shot we could have had
of getting laid right here.

439
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:41,013
Listen, I want to get up there.
I don't want to miss a thing.

440
00:30:43,013 --> 00:30:46,312
All right. There you go.
Just as good as new. Give her a try.

441
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,312
- That's it?
- That's it.

442
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:50,412
All right.

443
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,710
We'll see.

444
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,710
Hey, I don't think it's the throttle.
I think it's the clutch!

445
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,675
Good-bye.

446
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:01,609
Look out!
Hey, watch out!

447
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:03,409
Watch out!

448
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:07,508
Coming through!

449
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:16,907
What in the hell was that?

450
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:20,006
That must be the entry
of the National Safety Council.

451
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:53,701
Good day.

452
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:56,900
I am here to participate
in your little jaunt to California.

453
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,600
Well, of course.
If you would sign in here, please.

454
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:06,499
Hold still, Petey.
Say cheese.

455
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:11,098
I realize the novelty
of a major celebrity...

456
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:13,198
entering your little race...

457
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:16,797
but kindly resist the temptation and
keep the media coverage to a minimum.

458
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:19,097
- Thank you.
- Will you hurry the hell up?

459
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:37,394
Hurry up!

460
00:32:51,391 --> 00:32:55,191
Man does not live
on... on bread alone.

461
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:58,721
What concerns me is, do we have
enough ice for all this beer?

462
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,490
Plenty.

463
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,690
Yeah, well, how about food, son.
Did you bring enough food?

464
00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:07,092
Plenty.

465
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:09,069
Will you get serious?
Give me the rest of that beer.

466
00:33:19,787 --> 00:33:21,687
Excuse me, good sisters,
if you will.

467
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:24,887
Father, we do have a race to run,
and we're running a little late.

468
00:33:25,187 --> 00:33:27,586
So will you come on?
Will you excuse him, good sisters?

469
00:33:29,686 --> 00:33:32,386
- Bye-bye.
- Don't run off. Tonight's the night.

470
00:33:34,785 --> 00:33:36,585
I'd like to welcome you all...

471
00:33:36,685 --> 00:33:39,485
to an event that's sometimes been
called the automotive counterpart...

472
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,240
to the Bay of Pigs.

473
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,983
You all are certainly
the most distinguished group...

474
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,983
of highway scofflaws and degenerates...

475
00:33:48,182 --> 00:33:50,182
ever gathered together
in one place.

476
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:51,682
We're gonna have fun.

477
00:33:51,882 --> 00:33:55,281
Of course you know certain skeptics
note that perhaps 10,000...

478
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:57,781
of the nation's most elite
highway patrolmen...

479
00:33:57,881 --> 00:34:01,281
are out there waiting for us after
we start, but let's think positively.

480
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,680
Think of the fact that there is
not one state in the 50...

481
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,080
that has the death penalty
for speeding.

482
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,980
Although I'm not sure about Ohio.

483
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,979
Everybody is gonna get
a card like this.

484
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:16,578
When you leave, you're gonna
punch out here at this time clock.

485
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:19,078
Three thousand miles away from here...

486
00:34:19,278 --> 00:34:22,078
is another time clock just like that
at the Portofino Inn.

487
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:25,877
The difference between the two times
is your time across the country.

488
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:29,777
The record stands
at 32 hours and 51 minutes.

489
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:34,276
Believe it or not, those guys did
break the 55 mile an hour speed limit.

490
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:40,674
Let's get that first car up here.
We're gonna get this thing underway.

491
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,872
Go!

492
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:04,771
- I know.
- All right. Where's the doctor?

493
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:06,970
- I got everything else.
- Where's the doctor?

494
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,270
- I got 60 gallons of gas...
- Can you read my lips?

495
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,570
- Where is the doctor?
- The auxiliary tanks...

496
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,189
Goddamn it, I gave you one
responsibility... to get a doctor.

497
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:16,369
You give me no doctor.
Where is he?

498
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:18,769
He got sick.

499
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:21,468
Listen to what I'm telling you.
You go find a doctor.

500
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:23,768
Get me Dr. Kildare.
Get me Dr. Livingston.

501
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:25,788
Get me Dr. Frankenstein.
Just get me a doctor.

502
00:35:25,888 --> 00:35:28,167
- Go where the doctors hang out.
- Where is that?

503
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:29,667
Bars, golf courses.

504
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:32,560
Golf course, bar. All right.
Where else? Hospital!

505
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:33,669
Try that too.

506
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,465
My jet will take you to California.

507
00:35:36,665 --> 00:35:39,065
It's time for you to punch out.

508
00:35:42,764 --> 00:35:45,488
I'll see you in California!
I love you!

509
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,663
A toast to us, you and me.

510
00:35:53,863 --> 00:35:56,062
- We're gonna win the whole thing.
- It's a cinch.

511
00:35:56,162 --> 00:35:59,362
The more I look around
and see these turkeys...

512
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:00,614
I have...

513
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,673
While you're drinking,
that truck to the left...

514
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:09,361
Isn't that J.J. McClure?

515
00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:11,660
He's nothing.

516
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,860
Don't worry about him.
It's the blimp next to him. The blimp.

517
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,659
When he puts on that mask,
he'll blow your goddamn doors off.

518
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,459
You understand that?
The blimp!

519
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:34,656
Was that weird?

520
00:36:40,255 --> 00:36:42,455
It's a Nevada license plate...

521
00:36:42,555 --> 00:36:44,555
and that's...

522
00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:46,854
whiskey, zebra, alpha...

523
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,354
niner, fiver, zero.

524
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:51,354
- You got that?
- What?

525
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:55,453
Just write W-Z-A...
No, here.

526
00:36:55,653 --> 00:37:00,152
Will you let me do it?
W-Z-A-9-5-0.

527
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:04,352
See? Whiskey, zebra, alpha,
niner, fiver, zero.

528
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:14,138
Okay, so it's Interstate 80
through Pennsylvania.

529
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:17,950
Oh, that's a good looking piece.

530
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,949
And cunningly disguised
so it won't look like a racing car.

531
00:37:22,149 --> 00:37:25,449
You know, the cops would never
give that a second glance.

532
00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:29,047
Two hundred and twenty miles an hour,
and they won't get a second glance.

533
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,147
Hey, when we get to California...

534
00:37:31,247 --> 00:37:34,047
I got a place out at Palos Verdes...

535
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:37,346
You boys gonna start this thing or just
sit and wait for that paint to dry?

536
00:37:39,146 --> 00:37:40,546
Yes, sir.

537
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:45,445
- How long till we stop?
- Eight hours.

538
00:37:45,645 --> 00:37:48,445
Damn, I gotta go to the john.

539
00:37:56,643 --> 00:37:57,643
Go.

540
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:05,542
Mad Dog, you are gonna take the shortcut
to the interstate, aren't you?

541
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,842
We're here to win, ain't we?

542
00:38:07,942 --> 00:38:11,641
If you're gonna be a bear,
be a grizzly.

543
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,290
My God, Pamela.

544
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,101
Did you see that?

545
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,838
They drove right through those trees.
I love trees. Did I tell you...

546
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,138
We are going right down there and bring
this thing to a screeching halt...

547
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,637
right now.

548
00:38:31,837 --> 00:38:34,037
Buckle up.
We're going into action.

549
00:38:36,537 --> 00:38:38,836
Would you mind?

550
00:38:39,036 --> 00:38:41,936
- Very civil.
- Might be easier with your lights on.

551
00:38:42,136 --> 00:38:43,936
Why advertise?

552
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:47,635
- Wait a minute, Father.
- What?

553
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:51,335
That's a no-no. Haven't you heard? They
haven't allowed that for 2,000 years.

554
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:53,934
No, look. I'm a liberal wing.

555
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:55,934
Way out on the other
part of the church.

556
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,534
- It's nothing at all.
- Keep flying, Father.

557
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:05,985
How about just one of you?

558
00:39:08,732 --> 00:39:10,932
Who says cops won't stop honeymooners?

559
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:13,432
Anyhow, why do I
have to be the bride?

560
00:39:13,632 --> 00:39:15,158
Shut up, sweetie,
and punch the clock.

561
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:20,331
- Okay, go slow until I get my wig on.
- Yes, dear.

562
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:26,429
Well, old pal of mine,
are we all set for California?

563
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:31,928
- Next time, Methodist. Methodist!
- All right, pal of mine.

564
00:39:32,128 --> 00:39:34,128
Okay, okay. You're all right.

565
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:36,527
Okay, now, who's driving?

566
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:38,127
- You are.
- You're driving.

567
00:39:38,227 --> 00:39:40,927
- I can't drive.
- Then I'm driving.

568
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:42,626
Yeah, I think you are.

569
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:44,526
All right.
Put me down.

570
00:39:46,326 --> 00:39:48,626
You hold this.
I'll get in the car.

571
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,424
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

572
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:00,424
Somebody's hat!

573
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:07,789
Hold my drink.

574
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,620
Hit it!

575
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:30,296
Thank you, good sisters.

576
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:34,718
May the good Lord take a liking to you,
but not too soon.

577
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:36,818
Bless you, my children.

578
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,717
Those guys are more juiced up
than that Ferrari.

579
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:56,915
- J. J., wait. I got the doc.
- Terrific.

580
00:40:57,015 --> 00:40:59,415
No, wait.
He's in the ambulance. This way.

581
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:04,114
Before I open this,
don't get your hopes up too high.

582
00:41:04,314 --> 00:41:06,214
- I was pressed for time.
- No problem.

583
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:11,913
Holy shit!

584
00:41:12,113 --> 00:41:14,010
I'm honored, sir.

585
00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:16,311
I'm Doctor Nicholas...

586
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:19,411
Nicholas Van Helsing,
professor of proctology...

587
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:21,263
and other related tendencies.

588
00:41:21,477 --> 00:41:23,910
Graduate of the University
of Rangoon...

589
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,610
and assorted night classes...

590
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:28,815
at the Knoxville, Tennessee,
College of Faith Healing.

591
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:32,009
You may be a little
overqualified for this job.

592
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:33,936
You got your equipment with you?

593
00:41:34,128 --> 00:41:36,408
I never go anywhere without it.

594
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:39,908
However, in my particular line of work,
I seldom need more than this.

595
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:44,858
Or this.

596
00:41:51,406 --> 00:41:53,106
We'll talk about this later.

597
00:41:53,563 --> 00:41:56,506
Now, sir, before we commence
this odyssey...

598
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,605
which I understand will carry us
across this grand nation...

599
00:41:59,805 --> 00:42:01,705
from sea to shining sea...

600
00:42:01,805 --> 00:42:04,550
there's the matter of my compensation.

601
00:42:04,912 --> 00:42:07,387
I've determined that my services
will require...

602
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,204
the payment of $2,000.

603
00:42:13,102 --> 00:42:15,902
I was thinking more
along the lines of $200.

604
00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:18,201
Fortunately...

605
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:21,937
my practice allows me
a certain flexibility.

606
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:26,600
After checking my schedule, I find
I'll be able to make the journey.

607
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,400
As far as the money's concerned,
you've got a deal.

608
00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:34,799
We're off!

609
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,899
Here we go.

610
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:42,098
Three thousand carefree,
madcap miles to California.

611
00:42:42,198 --> 00:42:44,098
~ <i>California, here we come</i> ~

612
00:42:44,198 --> 00:42:46,697
~ <i>Right back where we started from</i> ~

613
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,797
Thanks to you, Victor, we do not have
a female patient in the back...

614
00:42:49,997 --> 00:42:51,997
thanks to your wonderful Cousin Tessie.

615
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:55,896
It's not my fault
that she didn't fit in the stretcher.

616
00:42:56,196 --> 00:42:57,596
Doesn't fit in the ambulance.

617
00:42:57,796 --> 00:42:59,896
I got the doc here, didn't I?

618
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:06,295
Don't ever tell me where you got him.
I don't want to know where you got him.

619
00:43:06,595 --> 00:43:08,794
I was just surprised
that all the animals there were...

620
00:43:08,894 --> 00:43:10,893
I don't want to know
where you got him!

621
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:14,593
Hey, maybe I could be the patient.

622
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:17,392
That's a good idea.
Everybody would believe you were sick.

623
00:43:17,592 --> 00:43:20,392
- Don't you believe he's sick?
- Want me to examine him?

624
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:25,191
Him doesn't like it
when you say bad things about me.

625
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:26,984
And you know that.

626
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:30,490
Thanks to you, though,
we don't have a female patient.

627
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,590
And we've got to find a female...

628
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,789
Damn Cannonballers.

629
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:43,488
I'm so happy you're here.

630
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:46,483
- Can you help me with Mr...
- Foyt.

631
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:49,388
- Foyt.
- Sure. That's what I'm here for.

632
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:52,387
Mr. Foyt. Go around and get in
the emergency entrance.

633
00:43:53,787 --> 00:43:56,987
Come on right here.
There we go. Hit it!

634
00:43:57,187 --> 00:43:59,186
Wait, I'm not...

635
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:03,686
This is really terrific...

636
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:06,284
the way you guys go around
helping people.

637
00:44:06,484 --> 00:44:08,384
Next year we're going
for the Nobel Prize.

638
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:10,484
That's where the big bucks are.

639
00:44:13,883 --> 00:44:16,783
You forgot Mr... Mr...

640
00:44:19,182 --> 00:44:23,182
Well, we got you.
We're batting.500. Nobody's perfect.

641
00:44:23,482 --> 00:44:25,482
Well, I think you have to go back
and pick him up.

642
00:44:27,781 --> 00:44:30,581
We'd really like to,
but we're on kind a tight schedule.

643
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:32,581
We're on our way to California.

644
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:35,295
You'd be amazed how many
sick people there are out there.

645
00:44:35,637 --> 00:44:38,980
They need our help.
We could pick him up on the way back.

646
00:44:42,314 --> 00:44:44,679
Victor, can you help me?

647
00:44:44,779 --> 00:44:47,413
No, I can't.
I can't do anything.

648
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:49,778
But he can.

649
00:44:50,078 --> 00:44:51,445
Who can?

650
00:44:51,978 --> 00:44:52,978
Him.

651
00:45:03,136 --> 00:45:05,175
Excuse me.

652
00:45:09,365 --> 00:45:10,274
Doctor...

653
00:45:15,573 --> 00:45:17,622
My God, the perfect specimen.

654
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:21,773
J. J., you want me to start
the examination right away?

655
00:45:21,973 --> 00:45:24,772
I'm gonna like this job.
Right here, honey.

656
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,772
No, thank you.
Not right now.

657
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:37,070
Of course, man.
This took 30 years.

658
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:47,469
They won't be able to see us...

659
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:48,969
the son of a guns.

660
00:46:10,965 --> 00:46:12,564
I'm really sorry about that...

661
00:46:12,764 --> 00:46:14,464
little lapse, Officer.

662
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,464
Normally I drive
right around the speed limit.

663
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:20,763
We all make mistakes, miss, but 160?
That's a little more than a lapse.

664
00:46:30,362 --> 00:46:33,561
What the hell is going on here?
Everybody's driving like maniacs.

665
00:46:33,861 --> 00:46:35,261
I don't know, Officer.

666
00:46:35,427 --> 00:46:37,861
Let me see
your driver's license, please.

667
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:53,659
What the hell. I can't penalize
nice girls like you...

668
00:46:53,859 --> 00:46:56,457
for a little indiscretion...

669
00:46:56,557 --> 00:46:58,957
with the whole road packed with
speed-crazy lunatics.

670
00:47:00,757 --> 00:47:03,056
Here. You girls have a nice trip.

671
00:47:03,256 --> 00:47:05,256
- Drive carefully and take it easy.
- Thank you.

672
00:47:05,593 --> 00:47:08,556
- Come back and see us next year.
- Bye.

673
00:47:10,158 --> 00:47:12,755
Take care.
Keep it in the road.

674
00:47:16,954 --> 00:47:18,754
I don't know why you're pouting.

675
00:47:18,954 --> 00:47:22,154
I mean, look. We're taking
a nice, leisurely trip to California.

676
00:47:22,454 --> 00:47:24,583
And we're picking up all the bills.
This could be fun.

677
00:47:24,683 --> 00:47:26,753
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

678
00:47:26,953 --> 00:47:28,863
This is not a joke anymore.
I'm being kidnapped.

679
00:47:28,963 --> 00:47:30,952
You can call it kidnapping
if you want to be rude.

680
00:47:31,052 --> 00:47:33,852
Just think. We have
a professional physician on board...

681
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:35,652
in case somebody gets swamp fever.

682
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:40,351
You guys are strange.

683
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,550
We got company.

684
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,093
Yeah, I hear.

685
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:52,448
Okay, Beauty, you lie down
and be a patient for the police.

686
00:47:52,548 --> 00:47:54,548
- Come on. Why?
- Don't!

687
00:47:54,648 --> 00:47:57,048
I'm not gonna help you.
You didn't even help Mr...

688
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,547
Maybe I can help.

689
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:04,947
Dear God!

690
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:08,546
It's all right, miss. It doesn't hurt.
Give it to myself all the time.

691
00:48:08,846 --> 00:48:10,746
Yeah. He gives it to himself
all the time.

692
00:48:12,795 --> 00:48:14,045
Show her.

693
00:48:17,045 --> 00:48:18,896
Come on, Doc.
Show her.

694
00:48:20,944 --> 00:48:22,344
Show her.

695
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:39,342
There. You see?
That didn't hurt.

696
00:48:41,341 --> 00:48:43,141
- J.J.?
- No, thanks.

697
00:49:10,036 --> 00:49:12,236
Hi, guys. What's up?

698
00:49:12,436 --> 00:49:13,636
What's up?

699
00:49:13,836 --> 00:49:17,335
You guys are running at 120.
Your lights are flashing all over.

700
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:20,035
- We've got a patient in there.
- You were still speeding.

701
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,335
She's very sick.

702
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:26,034
There's not a hospital within 50 miles.
Where are you headed?

703
00:49:26,205 --> 00:49:28,334
- UCLA.
- UCLA?

704
00:49:28,634 --> 00:49:30,733
- UCLA Medical Center.
- L.A.

705
00:49:31,026 --> 00:49:32,133
California?

706
00:49:33,433 --> 00:49:36,833
This is going to sound like a dumb
question, but if she's that sick...

707
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:38,216
why didn't you fly her?

708
00:49:38,365 --> 00:49:39,837
Why didn't we fly her?

709
00:49:42,952 --> 00:49:46,230
I'm just the driver.
We have to ask the doc.

710
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,230
That's a good idea.
Why don't we ask the doc?

711
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:54,629
I'm sorry.

712
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:59,955
What's going on out here?
What is this crude interruption?

713
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:07,927
The patient... Why can't she
be flown to California?

714
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:10,727
Cysts on the walls of her lungs.

715
00:50:10,827 --> 00:50:12,227
Very rare.

716
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:15,294
You see, airplanes are only
pressurized at 10,000 feet.

717
00:50:15,657 --> 00:50:17,526
Anybody who knows anything
about medicine knows...

718
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:19,826
that she can't fly,
she has to be driven.

719
00:50:20,026 --> 00:50:22,225
We couldn't even go through Denver,
it's so high.

720
00:50:22,425 --> 00:50:26,025
Tell them to go back
and pick up Mr...

721
00:50:28,649 --> 00:50:31,295
- Is that lady all right?
- She's in great pain.

722
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:35,223
Causes her to make
certain delirious deliriums.

723
00:50:39,023 --> 00:50:40,523
Sounds like she's on something to me.

724
00:50:42,421 --> 00:50:45,521
Let me explain something to you.
We have to get the senator's wife...

725
00:50:45,721 --> 00:50:48,021
to California in 72 hours.

726
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:49,720
You understand what I'm saying?

727
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,620
We have to get the senator's wife...

728
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,519
to California in 72 hours.

729
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:58,619
We're very close.

730
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:04,018
As long as you're in New Jersey,
I want you fellows to take it easy.

731
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:06,718
- You got that?
- We sure do.

732
00:51:08,718 --> 00:51:11,217
- Thanks a lot.
- Get this rig out of here.

733
00:51:14,317 --> 00:51:16,517
I'm glad there's no cupcakes
like that in New Jersey.

734
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:19,016
You haven't met
my brother-in-law Ralph.

735
00:51:28,415 --> 00:51:30,525
I thought that cop was gonna have
a cardiac arrest...

736
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,714
when we said we were going
to California.

737
00:51:34,714 --> 00:51:36,314
Wasn't Beauty terrific?

738
00:51:36,414 --> 00:51:38,212
The lady was splendid.

739
00:51:38,412 --> 00:51:41,712
She should have her picture
on the cover of the AMAJournal.

740
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:49,611
I'm sure that doctor's
a very sweet man, basically.

741
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:50,811
Ah, thanks.

742
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,410
But don't you ever tell me
where you found him.

743
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,510
Ever.

744
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,010
It's the Cannonball.
It's the damn Cannonball for sure.

745
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:00,409
They blasted away
right in front of my eyes.

746
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:03,309
And they kidnapped a girl
named Pamela Glover...

747
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:06,209
just like it was the goddamn
Red Brigade or something.

748
00:52:07,608 --> 00:52:10,608
No, I've got them.
This time I've got them.

749
00:52:10,908 --> 00:52:13,507
Ohio? Yes.
Ohio has been notified.

750
00:52:14,907 --> 00:52:17,307
Ohio has been notified.

751
00:52:17,407 --> 00:52:20,107
And Missouri.
And California.

752
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:23,596
We'll get them, and I'm gonna
be there to handle it.

753
00:52:24,322 --> 00:52:26,306
You can count on it.

754
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,505
I've got two minutes
to catch my flight.

755
00:52:30,705 --> 00:52:31,705
Bye.

756
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:40,450
- Madam. Madam.
- Madam?

757
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,902
I'm no madam.
I'm a decent, respectable woman.

758
00:52:43,102 --> 00:52:45,202
I don't even own a house.
I live in an apartment.

759
00:52:45,402 --> 00:52:47,602
Now get off my case.
I'm late for my plane.

760
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,518
- After my career in the RAF...
- The what?

761
00:53:05,646 --> 00:53:07,599
The Royal Air Force.

762
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:11,298
- Do you mind if I have a cigarette?
- Please, go ahead. They're your lungs.

763
00:53:11,498 --> 00:53:14,598
Well, I had a chestful of citations...
medals, that sort of thing...

764
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:16,678
and then I drifted in playing
a rather popular...

765
00:53:16,778 --> 00:53:18,897
Not that one, darling, please.

766
00:53:18,997 --> 00:53:22,497
We don't want you leaving so shortly
after the trip has begun, do we?

767
00:53:22,697 --> 00:53:24,696
No, of course not.

768
00:53:24,796 --> 00:53:26,996
Then I drifted into playing...

769
00:53:27,096 --> 00:53:29,796
a rather popular character
on a television series.

770
00:53:29,896 --> 00:53:31,694
It's still in syndication, you know.

771
00:53:33,188 --> 00:53:34,510
Puff away.

772
00:53:35,994 --> 00:53:39,293
Thanks a lot, ladies.
But I would take it a little easier.

773
00:53:39,393 --> 00:53:42,793
Some of the officers up the road
might not be as understanding.

774
00:53:43,093 --> 00:53:47,392
Thank you so much, Officer.
We really do appreciate that warning.

775
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:49,192
And if you're ever in Duluth...

776
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,292
remember to look me up.

777
00:53:52,592 --> 00:53:55,991
I got the number.
You can count on it.

778
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:08,889
How's the patient?

779
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:14,588
She's alive.

780
00:54:14,788 --> 00:54:17,488
Looks like she survived the procedure.

781
00:54:17,688 --> 00:54:18,988
What procedure?

782
00:54:19,788 --> 00:54:22,187
If you guys laid a finger on me...

783
00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:28,985
No, I just gave her a little prick.

784
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:32,385
With this.

785
00:54:32,485 --> 00:54:35,884
Hey, Super Chief, will you lean forward
so I can get the front wheel down?

786
00:54:36,084 --> 00:54:37,984
Stop kidding. I am.

787
00:54:54,282 --> 00:54:58,381
Pull over!
We want to give you our blessings.

788
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:02,081
There are two priests
in that car over there.

789
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,680
They want us to pull over.

790
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,479
They're two priests
driving a Ferrari.

791
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:14,379
When's the last time you saw
two priests driving a Ferrari?

792
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:16,019
Are they taking the bingo money home?

793
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:18,178
Oh, no, they're doing
the work of the Lord.

794
00:55:18,378 --> 00:55:20,578
In a Ferrari, they can just
do it faster, that's all.

795
00:55:21,978 --> 00:55:23,278
Pull over!

796
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:26,776
We want to bless you!

797
00:55:30,776 --> 00:55:32,775
One of the priests is black.

798
00:55:32,975 --> 00:55:35,675
- Oh, yeah. They have black priests.
- They do?

799
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:37,675
Oh, sure.
They have a black cardinal.

800
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:40,374
Oh, they do want us to pull over.

801
00:55:40,574 --> 00:55:42,774
They want to bless us.
Can we?

802
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:45,374
Let me get this straight.

803
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:48,573
You want us to pull over
and be blessed...

804
00:55:48,773 --> 00:55:51,073
by a black priest in a red Ferrari?

805
00:55:51,273 --> 00:55:52,273
Couldn't hurt.

806
00:56:03,371 --> 00:56:06,271
- Nice car, Father.
- Thank you, asshole.

807
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,770
Hello, Father.
Nice-looking car.

808
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,470
That's what everyone says.
He even said it.

809
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,369
I want to thank you
for stopping, son...

810
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:17,969
'cause we always stop the ambulance...

811
00:56:18,169 --> 00:56:20,269
so we can bless
whoever's in there...

812
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:23,367
and you paramedics are doing
such a wonderful job.

813
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:26,667
We're in kind of a hurry,
so just bless it and we can go.

814
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:31,066
- Oh, I gotta bless her.
- I'm sorry, Father.

815
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:33,366
She's a Zen Buddhist.

816
00:56:33,466 --> 00:56:35,216
You're not a Zen Buddhist,
so you can't bless her.

817
00:56:35,316 --> 00:56:37,765
We specialize in blessing Zen Buddhists.

818
00:56:45,764 --> 00:56:48,064
On second thought, Father,
you want to bless him?

819
00:56:48,164 --> 00:56:50,270
We need all the help we can get.

820
00:56:50,663 --> 00:56:52,063
Just give him a little shot.

821
00:56:53,563 --> 00:56:55,363
Thank you, Father.

822
00:56:56,463 --> 00:56:58,399
- You're quite welcome.
- You did a good job.

823
00:56:58,484 --> 00:56:59,764
Thank you.

824
00:57:02,985 --> 00:57:04,661
Thank you, Father.

825
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:08,461
Why don't you take that piece of shit
back to the junkyard?

826
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,758
- We got a...
- Flat.

827
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:22,358
- And those priests...
- Weren't fathers.

828
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:24,149
- They were...
- Mothers.

829
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,538
Come here.

830
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,657
Ah, shit!

831
00:57:36,864 --> 00:57:38,848
International film star...

832
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:40,355
ruthless assassin...

833
00:57:40,455 --> 00:57:43,155
Casanova, poet, philosopher...

834
00:57:43,455 --> 00:57:46,055
You might say a legend in my own time...
in fact, you can.

835
00:57:47,954 --> 00:57:51,254
Not that one, darling. I'm afraid
this car is full of surprises.

836
00:57:51,454 --> 00:57:53,853
This is something I've noticed,
I must say.

837
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,753
How about some champagne,
darling?

838
00:57:57,353 --> 00:57:58,853
<i>Hey, little silver four-wheeler...</i>

839
00:57:59,053 --> 00:58:01,223
<i>that just flew past me</i>
<i>with the good-looking seat cover.</i>

840
00:58:01,323 --> 00:58:05,223
<i>Son, back that thing down.</i>
<i>You got smokies all over my back door.</i>

841
00:58:05,952 --> 00:58:07,651
If you are referring to me...

842
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:11,751
I request that you speak more clearly
in the queen's English.

843
00:58:11,851 --> 00:58:14,651
That is, if we are going to converse
on this wireless.

844
00:58:15,649 --> 00:58:17,149
Bless your heart.

845
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:20,149
Cheers.
Down the hatch.

846
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:52,478
What do you think you're doing?

847
00:58:53,068 --> 00:58:55,044
You can't come in here.
You're a man.

848
00:58:55,144 --> 00:58:58,243
<i>- 7-Eleven. How can I help you?</i>
- Pumps one and two... hit 'em.

849
00:58:58,543 --> 00:59:01,907
<i>What are you, some kind of nut?</i>
<i>You got one unleaded and one premium.</i>

850
00:59:03,243 --> 00:59:04,980
She goes both ways.

851
00:59:05,406 --> 00:59:08,706
The round orange moon pie with
the white hat on... he'll pay for it.

852
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,342
I'm a doctor, and if I may be
permitted the indelicacy...

853
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,577
you seen one,
you've seen 'em all.

854
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:23,339
Come on.
A thousand miles on one wheel?

855
00:59:23,539 --> 00:59:25,838
We're trying to win a race,
not set a record.

856
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:46,175
- Victor, what do you got?
- A lot of goodies for you guys...

857
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:48,373
and a Big Gulp Dr Pepper for me.

858
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:51,552
~ <i>I'm a pepper, you're a pepper</i>
<i>He's a pepper, she's a pepper</i> ~

859
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,135
~ <i>Wouldn't you like to be</i>
<i>a pepper too</i> ~

860
00:59:53,335 --> 00:59:55,734
- Will you get in here.
- Okay. Here you go.

861
01:00:04,533 --> 01:00:05,833
Officer!

862
01:00:10,169 --> 01:00:12,132
Do you take your law and order
in this town seriously?

863
01:00:12,345 --> 01:00:13,540
Are you kidding?

864
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:20,380
Excuse me for asking.

865
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,756
Greek! But...

866
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,466
Would you shut up a minute
and listen to me?

867
01:00:39,627 --> 01:00:41,927
Oh, by the way, Greek.

868
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:45,626
What's the odds on the japanese team
not finishing?

869
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,720
There's gonna be a red Ferrari come
flying through here in a few seconds...

870
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:51,130
and the two men driving
are responsible for the victim...

871
01:00:51,344 --> 01:00:52,425
lying back here
in this ambulance.

872
01:00:53,093 --> 01:00:55,717
- Victim?
- A flasher victim.

873
01:00:56,912 --> 01:00:58,685
- You want to know the worst part?
- What's that?

874
01:00:58,824 --> 01:01:01,024
- They're dressed as priests.
- Go on.

875
01:01:01,307 --> 01:01:04,315
I guess they think it's a little
kinkier, you know, dressed as priests.

876
01:01:04,485 --> 01:01:07,110
Goddamn, that's sick.
I'll handle this.

877
01:01:07,387 --> 01:01:10,160
Oh... one more thing.
I think they're armed.

878
01:01:11,522 --> 01:01:15,536
Damn, I hope so.
It'll give me an excuse.

879
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,820
Flashers!

880
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:28,319
Bye-bye!

881
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:30,519
J. J., you son of a...

882
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:33,418
Out of the car,
both of you. Now!

883
01:01:37,518 --> 01:01:38,918
All right, hit it.

884
01:01:39,518 --> 01:01:40,917
- Hit it?
- Hit it?

885
01:01:47,616 --> 01:01:49,756
Freeze, or name your beneficiary.

886
01:01:49,969 --> 01:01:51,616
Beneficiary?

887
01:01:51,816 --> 01:01:53,816
Officer, I sincerely hope...

888
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:55,686
- you're not a Catholic.
- Pay no attention to him.

889
01:01:55,786 --> 01:01:58,204
He's been locked up for six years
in that monastery...

890
01:01:58,315 --> 01:01:59,815
and he don't know what he's doing.

891
01:01:59,915 --> 01:02:01,955
I don't think both of his paddles
are in the water.

892
01:02:02,113 --> 01:02:04,043
Six years is gonna seem like
a summer vacation...

893
01:02:04,143 --> 01:02:06,183
when the state of Missouri
gets through with you.

894
01:02:06,503 --> 01:02:09,938
You, shorty.
Where'd you get all that jewelry?

895
01:02:11,012 --> 01:02:14,724
- Why'd he call me shorty?
- 'Cause you're small. Small.

896
01:02:15,312 --> 01:02:16,711
S-M-ALL.

897
01:02:17,911 --> 01:02:20,211
<i>I suggest you take</i>
<i>another route, good buddy.</i>

898
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:22,511
<i>The smokies are getting traffic</i>
<i>all tied up on 40...</i>

899
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:24,310
<i>Looking for them Cannonballers.</i>

900
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:26,110
<i>That's a big ten-four.</i>

901
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,710
- Hey, J.J.
- Yeah?

902
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:30,574
There's a lot of talk on the CB
about the roadblock ahead.

903
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:31,909
What do you think?

904
01:02:32,109 --> 01:02:33,540
I think we're in deep you-know-what.

905
01:02:34,386 --> 01:02:35,759
The transmission is slipping.

906
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:39,208
And we lost a lot of time
because of your two phony priests.

907
01:02:39,508 --> 01:02:41,299
Oh. I'm sorry.

908
01:02:42,472 --> 01:02:44,507
Listen, if the transmission
does hold together...

909
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:47,557
you think we're gonna be able to bluff
our way through the roadblock ahead?

910
01:02:47,657 --> 01:02:48,851
I don't know.

911
01:02:49,207 --> 01:02:51,347
Give me a minute
to gather my thoughts.

912
01:02:58,904 --> 01:03:01,822
I gathered my thoughts.
Hey, Lowboy!

913
01:03:02,057 --> 01:03:03,704
Look in your rearview mirror.

914
01:03:03,955 --> 01:03:05,553
You see this ambulance back here?

915
01:03:05,812 --> 01:03:07,503
We need a piggyback ride.

916
01:03:09,403 --> 01:03:12,020
This one can go by.
There's no problem here.

917
01:03:12,303 --> 01:03:15,348
Let's just have this one and...

918
01:03:15,602 --> 01:03:17,402
that one.

919
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:23,476
Yeah, that one's okay.
Let it go.

920
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,300
Excuse me, but you look very familiar.
Do I know you?

921
01:03:31,498 --> 01:03:33,650
Yes, that's quite possible.
Is this going to take long?

922
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:36,299
You see, we're on our honeymoon,
and she can't wait.

923
01:03:36,499 --> 01:03:38,099
Oh, thank God.
Normal people!

924
01:03:38,199 --> 01:03:40,079
No, you see, we were just
looking for Cannon...

925
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:42,498
It's not important.
Just move along, if you would.

926
01:03:42,741 --> 01:03:45,298
- What is this, anyway?
- It's a stakeout.

927
01:03:45,398 --> 01:03:46,943
Oh. Bon appetit.

928
01:03:48,597 --> 01:03:49,997
English humor.

929
01:03:51,397 --> 01:03:53,197
Come on, guys,
keep moving, will you, please?

930
01:03:56,895 --> 01:03:58,378
Let's see...

931
01:04:01,195 --> 01:04:03,797
Quiet, Victor.
You're gonna blow our cover.

932
01:04:03,904 --> 01:04:06,494
J. J., this is not
a nine-to-five job.

933
01:04:06,794 --> 01:04:08,768
I wish him were here.

934
01:04:08,894 --> 01:04:09,894
Hi.

935
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:11,893
Hello.

936
01:04:16,256 --> 01:04:17,392
You look tired.

937
01:04:17,707 --> 01:04:19,925
More frustrated than tired.

938
01:04:20,075 --> 01:04:22,230
Think you're gonna win
this crazy race?

939
01:04:23,168 --> 01:04:24,384
Damn right I am.

940
01:04:25,391 --> 01:04:29,191
I'm sitting here having a conversation
with somebody who kidnapped me.

941
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:33,390
Who can blame anybody
for kidnapping you?

942
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:36,490
You gave me laughing gas.

943
01:04:36,843 --> 01:04:39,915
Well, you have
an awful beautiful laugh.

944
01:04:40,427 --> 01:04:42,689
You made me forget my favorite skirt
back at the motel.

945
01:04:42,889 --> 01:04:45,846
Doesn't matter.
You look terrific without it.

946
01:04:54,286 --> 01:04:55,786
What'd you expect, anyway?

947
01:04:58,785 --> 01:05:01,484
- A gang bang or something like that.
- A gang bang?

948
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:04,085
We're racers, not rapists.

949
01:05:05,784 --> 01:05:08,484
- Why?
- Why what?

950
01:05:10,184 --> 01:05:13,583
Why all this speed and trouble
and risk and...

951
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,202
I mean, what for?

952
01:05:15,683 --> 01:05:16,994
For the hell of it.

953
01:05:19,746 --> 01:05:21,163
Didn't you ever do anything
just for the hell of it?

954
01:05:21,782 --> 01:05:23,282
I guess so.

955
01:05:24,269 --> 01:05:26,146
My father used to work
in the coal mines.

956
01:05:28,981 --> 01:05:30,281
Forty-three years.

957
01:05:32,581 --> 01:05:34,338
He was gonna retire.

958
01:05:35,597 --> 01:05:36,834
Buy a houseboat.

959
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:39,416
Move down to Florida.

960
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:44,216
Fish on the back of the boat
and tell my mom lies.

961
01:05:47,379 --> 01:05:49,577
He died two days
before he was gonna retire.

962
01:05:52,131 --> 01:05:53,624
I guess you just never know.

963
01:05:54,577 --> 01:05:55,577
Yeah.

964
01:05:57,379 --> 01:05:59,150
I made up my mind right then.

965
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:01,560
I was gonna go for it...

966
01:06:02,176 --> 01:06:03,675
I mean, everything I wanted...

967
01:06:04,035 --> 01:06:06,040
I was gonna go for it
right then...

968
01:06:07,075 --> 01:06:09,283
because you never know when
something's gonna happen to you.

969
01:06:10,874 --> 01:06:12,633
Like talking to you, you know?

970
01:06:14,174 --> 01:06:15,875
I mean, it's really nice.

971
01:06:19,716 --> 01:06:22,373
Excuse me.
Where are you guys going?

972
01:06:22,574 --> 01:06:26,172
We're just out
looking for a pack of cigarettes.

973
01:06:26,472 --> 01:06:28,272
With North Carolina plates...

974
01:06:28,372 --> 01:06:30,052
you're driving
to Missouri for cigarettes?

975
01:06:32,217 --> 01:06:33,371
How about a beer?

976
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:36,171
How about the fact
that your paint job is coming off?

977
01:06:36,569 --> 01:06:39,970
You want to take these guys away?
The good guys strike back!

978
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:44,015
What is that? Five, eight, three...
Five, eight, three, six...

979
01:06:46,568 --> 01:06:47,868
Hold on. Hold on.

980
01:06:47,968 --> 01:06:50,068
Let it go. Come on.

981
01:06:50,268 --> 01:06:52,267
Come on, guys, keep moving,
will you please?

982
01:06:57,067 --> 01:06:59,439
Howdy, sir.
What seems to be the problem?

983
01:06:59,566 --> 01:07:01,826
You guys didn't really think
you'd get away with this, did you?

984
01:07:01,926 --> 01:07:03,286
We're gonna get
the whole lot of you now.

985
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:06,265
Not here, you won't. The word is out
about your little roadblock.

986
01:07:06,465 --> 01:07:08,865
They're talking about it
all up and down the "superslab."

987
01:07:09,665 --> 01:07:12,265
Get these traitors out of here,
will you?

988
01:07:12,965 --> 01:07:14,764
Think you're so big.

989
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:19,064
Do some of you people want to come over
and push this thing out of the way?

990
01:07:19,365 --> 01:07:21,263
Come on.
I'll put it in neutral.

991
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:25,263
Who did that?
Make it stop!

992
01:07:41,211 --> 01:07:43,159
Thanks a lot!
Keep on truckin'!

993
01:07:57,057 --> 01:08:00,006
Hey, George, you remember the good old
days before they got radar in?

994
01:08:00,157 --> 01:08:01,657
We used to chase speeders?

995
01:08:01,757 --> 01:08:03,456
Yeah. This is really boring.

996
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:24,534
Bye-bye!

997
01:08:24,647 --> 01:08:26,653
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know...

998
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:28,953
but whatever the hell it was,
it was doing 125.

999
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:46,759
That's the first time
we took an order by phone.

1000
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:48,199
It was hard to understand you.

1001
01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:51,357
When I called you,
I was doing 140 miles an hour.

1002
01:08:51,549 --> 01:08:53,648
That was six lamb burgers,
four shish kebabs...

1003
01:08:53,848 --> 01:08:55,848
a side order of couscous...

1004
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:58,048
and two milk.

1005
01:08:58,248 --> 01:08:59,947
No! How much?

1006
01:09:00,047 --> 01:09:01,448
Six seventy-five.

1007
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,051
Here, my desert blossom.

1008
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:05,847
Keep the change.

1009
01:09:06,047 --> 01:09:08,446
Have you ever considered
joining a harem?

1010
01:09:10,018 --> 01:09:12,946
I shall return for you
after the race.

1011
01:09:21,544 --> 01:09:22,718
Get a physical.

1012
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:25,444
I shall return, my little fig.
I love you!

1013
01:09:35,143 --> 01:09:38,078
I don't know
how to ask you this, but...

1014
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:40,401
isn't it a little strange
having that guy...

1015
01:09:40,553 --> 01:09:42,940
running around inside your head?

1016
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,640
He's not in here.

1017
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,785
He's out there somewhere,
helping people.

1018
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,690
He's always helping people.
He'd help you.

1019
01:09:51,881 --> 01:09:53,139
He would?

1020
01:09:53,239 --> 01:09:54,783
He likes you.

1021
01:09:57,538 --> 01:09:58,838
How did he find you?

1022
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:01,038
I mean, how did you two
get together?

1023
01:10:01,138 --> 01:10:03,438
Well, when I was real young...

1024
01:10:03,637 --> 01:10:05,937
I didn't have any friends
like I do now.

1025
01:10:06,237 --> 01:10:07,637
Like J.J.

1026
01:10:08,937 --> 01:10:10,037
Like J.J.

1027
01:10:13,024 --> 01:10:14,836
One day I was in the schoolyard...

1028
01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:17,568
and nine guys were beating me up
pretty good.

1029
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:19,435
There he was.

1030
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:24,373
- Captain Chaos?
- Yeah. Out of the blue!

1031
01:10:24,501 --> 01:10:28,619
Pow! Slam! Bam! Boff!

1032
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,634
I sure was grateful.

1033
01:10:31,834 --> 01:10:33,032
That's great!

1034
01:10:33,232 --> 01:10:35,360
Nobody bothered me at school
after that.

1035
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:37,532
I wish I had a friend
like that.

1036
01:10:37,728 --> 01:10:40,431
Well, first you need a mask
and a cape.

1037
01:10:41,227 --> 01:10:43,331
I think I'd like mine
to be pink.

1038
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:45,231
Almost everything I wear
is pink.

1039
01:10:45,431 --> 01:10:46,746
Everything?

1040
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:49,056
Even...

1041
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:50,830
I don't wear any.

1042
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:52,363
You don't?

1043
01:10:53,793 --> 01:10:54,929
Wow.

1044
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:00,428
I'd like to be your friend...

1045
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:02,528
'cause I like you.

1046
01:11:03,528 --> 01:11:05,441
I like you too, Beauty.

1047
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,128
Thank you.

1048
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:22,625
New Mexico.

1049
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:35,423
Texas?
Stupid!

1050
01:12:05,361 --> 01:12:07,318
I'll take care of this one.

1051
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:21,516
Hello, hot pants.

1052
01:12:21,616 --> 01:12:23,516
I don't suppose
you have a driver's license...

1053
01:12:23,616 --> 01:12:25,827
tucked down in there somewhere,
do you?

1054
01:12:25,998 --> 01:12:27,534
Yes, Officer.

1055
01:12:36,313 --> 01:12:38,913
That policeman seems to want us
to stop, darling.

1056
01:12:39,213 --> 01:12:42,112
Yes. He must be rather upset
with our rapid rate.

1057
01:12:42,312 --> 01:12:44,992
Funny. They don't have any sense
of humor about that sort of thing.

1058
01:12:45,212 --> 01:12:46,611
Aren't you going to pull over?

1059
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:48,211
I'd rather not.

1060
01:12:48,311 --> 01:12:51,511
Can be such a bore,
talking to those chaps.

1061
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,910
Tell you what.
We'll just slip away.

1062
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:57,010
- Hit that button, will you?
- Like in your movies!

1063
01:13:02,692 --> 01:13:05,309
And now a little oil,
right, darling?

1064
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:19,707
Well, well. We are full of tricks,
aren't we?

1065
01:13:19,907 --> 01:13:22,007
It's all part of my business,
really.

1066
01:13:22,205 --> 01:13:25,925
I've been meaning to ask you, darling.
What movie... Wait a minute.

1067
01:13:26,181 --> 01:13:28,165
- Can you see where you're going?
- Perfectly.

1068
01:13:28,705 --> 01:13:30,904
This is ridiculous.

1069
01:13:37,903 --> 01:13:39,453
It's good sport, isn't it?

1070
01:13:39,553 --> 01:13:41,553
Would you mind rolling
your window down, old girl?

1071
01:13:41,703 --> 01:13:43,902
We're getting done up
like a couple of kippers here.

1072
01:13:44,102 --> 01:13:46,102
Next time, I bring my mask.

1073
01:13:46,202 --> 01:13:47,602
A foggy day in London town.

1074
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,000
<i>You are about to witness</i>
<i>the ravishment...</i>

1075
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,600
<i>of a woman who has been abducted.</i>

1076
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:08,799
<i>A woman whose initial fear</i>
<i>has mellowed into curious expectation.</i>

1077
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:12,798
<i>In the morning, she will be set free,</i>
<i>unaware of anything...</i>

1078
01:14:12,898 --> 01:14:16,598
<i>except that she has been loved</i>
<i>as never before.</i>

1079
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:28,695
<i>Oh, yes, there!</i>

1080
01:14:28,795 --> 01:14:29,795
<i>Yes!</i>

1081
01:14:42,593 --> 01:14:45,593
I've never seen a damn Rolls Royce
that'd do 140 miles an hour.

1082
01:14:45,793 --> 01:14:47,392
What do you fellas got
in that thing?

1083
01:14:47,492 --> 01:14:49,592
- Stock.
- Sign here.

1084
01:14:49,792 --> 01:14:51,792
I guess you must have misconstrued
my remark...

1085
01:14:51,992 --> 01:14:54,791
about my mother planning to purchase
Southern California...

1086
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:57,853
as an attempt to influence
your giving me a ticket, Officer.

1087
01:14:58,386 --> 01:15:01,390
I am sure that she will still
consider keeping you all on...

1088
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:03,890
as a member of the Highway Patrol,
regardless...

1089
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:05,690
of how shabbily
you treated her son.

1090
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:08,489
You might want to tell that
to the judge, sir.

1091
01:15:20,087 --> 01:15:22,786
This is for you and the judge!

1092
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:24,886
Goddamn camel jockey.

1093
01:15:34,185 --> 01:15:37,584
Oh, shit.
We got a smokey on our tail.

1094
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,284
Watch this.

1095
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:43,384
- Officer.
- Pull it over.

1096
01:15:43,484 --> 01:15:45,983
We got no brakes!
No brakes!

1097
01:15:46,283 --> 01:15:48,183
Help us!
Yes, thank you!

1098
01:15:48,283 --> 01:15:50,183
Damn "no brake" gag
works every time.

1099
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:56,182
Oh, no!
We really don't have any brakes!

1100
01:15:56,482 --> 01:15:58,481
- Quit kidding, will you?
- Hang on!

1101
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,880
Evel Knievel...

1102
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:12,378
you've got yourself
some competition.

1103
01:17:20,568 --> 01:17:22,177
Secret weapon.

1104
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:42,965
Ready, fire!

1105
01:17:58,462 --> 01:17:59,762
How long we been here?

1106
01:18:01,062 --> 01:18:03,362
Twenty minutes.
We could have been there by now.

1107
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:05,760
We're gonna be open
in five minutes, Father.

1108
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:17,517
Father Putz.

1109
01:18:18,797 --> 01:18:20,589
Albert Schweitzer!

1110
01:18:20,908 --> 01:18:24,158
I want to thank you for being
so sweet and so nice...

1111
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:28,312
and telling those people all about us
back in Missouri...

1112
01:18:28,504 --> 01:18:31,957
that we were both flashers
and sex maniacs.

1113
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:37,156
Well, I just
wanted to return the favor...

1114
01:18:37,356 --> 01:18:40,056
that you and the chocolate monk
did for us back in Ohio.

1115
01:18:41,155 --> 01:18:43,155
"The chocolate monk"?

1116
01:18:46,339 --> 01:18:48,792
He could say that.

1117
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:53,187
He could say it 'cause he's riding
around with the Goodyear blimp.

1118
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:54,404
"The Goodyear blimp"?

1119
01:18:54,504 --> 01:18:56,653
- He can say that.
- Yeah, I can say that.

1120
01:18:56,853 --> 01:18:59,353
Because if I had the time...

1121
01:18:59,453 --> 01:19:03,051
I would take those rosary beads
and stuff'em up your nose.

1122
01:19:03,193 --> 01:19:04,551
- These rosary beads?
- Yeah.

1123
01:19:04,651 --> 01:19:06,606
My rosary beads?
You're gonna shove 'em up this nose?

1124
01:19:06,862 --> 01:19:08,932
Up that nose, yeah.

1125
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:12,850
- He can do that.
- He can do that.

1126
01:19:13,796 --> 01:19:16,050
- You take a little advice?
- Sure.

1127
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:19,149
Bring friends.

1128
01:19:24,655 --> 01:19:26,063
A lot of them.

1129
01:19:31,716 --> 01:19:32,947
He wants me to bring...

1130
01:19:35,047 --> 01:19:36,147
Blimp?

1131
01:19:50,445 --> 01:19:53,544
Ah. The bride and groom
Cannonballer.

1132
01:19:53,844 --> 01:19:55,844
I told you this honeymoon scheme
would work.

1133
01:19:56,044 --> 01:19:58,194
Good. Now you wear the wig,
sweetheart.

1134
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:00,142
- It's hot.
- Oh, I don't know.

1135
01:20:00,342 --> 01:20:02,942
When I was in Egypt making
The Fly Who Bugged Me...

1136
01:20:03,142 --> 01:20:06,661
it was at least 180 in the shade...
not that there was much shade.

1137
01:20:06,841 --> 01:20:08,841
If CBS would have
had their cameras there...

1138
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:10,841
we'd have made Sports Spectacular
for sure.

1139
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:12,611
We just zoomed right out
over that train.

1140
01:20:12,711 --> 01:20:14,240
What, do you want
to try it again?

1141
01:20:35,974 --> 01:20:37,237
All right!

1142
01:20:38,837 --> 01:20:42,054
Don't you look precious,
all dressed up like that.

1143
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:45,318
And wearing a wig too.
Ain't he cute?

1144
01:20:45,553 --> 01:20:47,302
Those guys scare me.

1145
01:20:47,736 --> 01:20:50,535
You just stay close to Moore.
There won't be any trouble.

1146
01:20:51,535 --> 01:20:53,655
He looks like Gregory Peck
in that blue flannel suit.

1147
01:20:58,033 --> 01:20:59,733
This is my friend Shakey.

1148
01:20:59,933 --> 01:21:01,433
Allow me to present myself.

1149
01:21:01,633 --> 01:21:03,753
I'm on Wall Street.
Maybe we can have lunch sometime.

1150
01:21:04,432 --> 01:21:06,632
We don't ride on Wall Street.

1151
01:21:06,832 --> 01:21:09,132
Nah, we don't ride on Wall Street.

1152
01:21:09,232 --> 01:21:12,131
- Why don't we go over and help 'em out?
- What do you mean "we"?

1153
01:21:12,231 --> 01:21:16,031
If we do, then that road opens up
and you're long gone.

1154
01:21:16,331 --> 01:21:18,080
Now, why don't you?

1155
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:20,430
You're the Good Samaritan.

1156
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:23,230
Besides, I'm wearing these.

1157
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:26,450
Maybe you would like
to complete your ensemble.

1158
01:21:26,578 --> 01:21:28,269
Oh, no. There's something else
of yours that I want.

1159
01:21:28,369 --> 01:21:29,829
Oh, really? What's that?

1160
01:21:29,929 --> 01:21:31,228
Your ass!

1161
01:21:41,427 --> 01:21:42,727
Oh, shit.

1162
01:21:43,927 --> 01:21:45,826
Well, shall we join the fracas?

1163
01:22:04,723 --> 01:22:06,123
Step back, my dear.

1164
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:09,172
I must warn you,
I'm Roger Moore.

1165
01:22:09,272 --> 01:22:11,722
- Who?
- Roger Moore.

1166
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:17,021
We'll run in there.

1167
01:22:19,121 --> 01:22:20,621
Knock 'em flat out.

1168
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:23,720
- Then we go. We could still win it.
- We can do that.

1169
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,620
- We can do that. Yeah.
- We can do that.

1170
01:22:30,019 --> 01:22:32,719
You'll be sorry!
Let me down!

1171
01:22:35,718 --> 01:22:37,118
Take that!

1172
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:51,015
You're so macho.

1173
01:22:51,115 --> 01:22:52,515
Watch this.

1174
01:23:03,114 --> 01:23:04,513
Need some help, Father?

1175
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:09,913
Give me somebody!

1176
01:23:11,012 --> 01:23:12,912
What, are you crazy, Greek?

1177
01:23:13,112 --> 01:23:16,112
How could you possibly change odds
in the middle of things?

1178
01:23:18,112 --> 01:23:21,974
Hold it. You wouldn't last five minutes
in the New York subway.

1179
01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:25,110
That's the way it's done.

1180
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:38,443
- Is that good to drink?
- I don't know. I never tried it.

1181
01:23:50,406 --> 01:23:52,606
Hold it, hold it.
You wanna try this side?

1182
01:23:52,805 --> 01:23:53,805
Yeah.

1183
01:23:57,153 --> 01:23:59,005
Need some help?

1184
01:23:59,105 --> 01:24:00,804
- Will you get out of here?
- Right!

1185
01:24:10,703 --> 01:24:12,172
Thanks, Shakey.
Excuse me.

1186
01:24:12,303 --> 01:24:14,003
Get this guy, Shakey!

1187
01:24:17,002 --> 01:24:18,802
Excuse me, Father,
but the road's open.

1188
01:24:18,935 --> 01:24:20,402
Oh, thanks.

1189
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:24,101
The road's open!

1190
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:28,901
Bye.

1191
01:24:37,099 --> 01:24:38,599
Let's go! Hit it!

1192
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:37,845
- Come on, come on! Faster, faster!
- I'm trying.

1193
01:25:37,945 --> 01:25:40,788
- Come on, faster!
- Drive it like Captain Chaos would.

1194
01:25:41,088 --> 01:25:42,238
I'll try.

1195
01:25:42,338 --> 01:25:43,953
What'd you take off
that goddamn mask for?

1196
01:25:44,053 --> 01:25:45,948
I didn't take off the mask.
He took off the mask.

1197
01:25:57,786 --> 01:25:59,636
- We need him, Victor!
- I don't know where he is.

1198
01:25:59,736 --> 01:26:02,385
Very interesting fellow.
I'd like to probe his case.

1199
01:26:02,685 --> 01:26:05,135
I don't believe this shit.
We don't want him around, he's around.

1200
01:26:05,235 --> 01:26:07,484
When we want him, he's not around.
I'm gonna get a beer.

1201
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:43,778
It's only ten blocks to the finish.

1202
01:26:43,978 --> 01:26:47,678
I feel very confident
that we will be triumphant.

1203
01:27:03,876 --> 01:27:06,375
- What the hell was that?
- A Lamborghini.

1204
01:27:06,475 --> 01:27:09,075
- She in the race?
- Catch it!

1205
01:27:13,674 --> 01:27:15,874
Will you go faster!
Come on!

1206
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:20,873
I've seen every single one of your
movies at least three or four times.

1207
01:27:21,173 --> 01:27:22,473
Four times?

1208
01:27:22,673 --> 01:27:26,272
- I think we've got it goin', baby.
- Yeah, we're looking good.

1209
01:27:26,372 --> 01:27:28,472
Greek's gonna pay us money!

1210
01:27:28,572 --> 01:27:30,572
Gosh! Wait'll I tell my friends...

1211
01:27:30,672 --> 01:27:34,270
I was sitting
next to George Hamilton!

1212
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:36,770
George Hamilton?

1213
01:27:41,569 --> 01:27:42,969
- We got 'em!
- We got 'em!

1214
01:27:49,968 --> 01:27:51,568
Look out!

1215
01:27:52,868 --> 01:27:54,467
It's a foot race!

1216
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:56,482
- I've got the card...
- No, give me that, Doc.

1217
01:27:56,582 --> 01:27:58,367
Come on!
It's a foot race!

1218
01:27:58,567 --> 01:28:00,567
Have no fear!
Chaos is here!

1219
01:28:02,966 --> 01:28:05,266
Take it and win, Captain!

1220
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:11,765
Anyone need medical attention?

1221
01:28:13,265 --> 01:28:15,364
Go! Go, Chaos!

1222
01:28:17,864 --> 01:28:18,792
We're gonna win!

1223
01:28:18,942 --> 01:28:21,764
It's not a sporting way to win.
What do you say, Father?

1224
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:24,124
No, it's not a sporting way,
it's a shitty way to win.

1225
01:28:26,686 --> 01:28:29,661
We won!
We're gonna win!

1226
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:33,561
Help! Help! Somebody save my baby!
He's drowning!

1227
01:28:37,865 --> 01:28:40,160
No problem, fair lady.
I will save your baby.

1228
01:28:40,318 --> 01:28:42,217
Have no fear!

1229
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:51,358
Oh, my baby, my baby.

1230
01:28:51,604 --> 01:28:54,158
Thank you.
You're such a brave man.

1231
01:28:54,249 --> 01:28:56,105
You don't know
what this means to me.

1232
01:28:56,212 --> 01:28:59,457
Oh, my baby, I love you.

1233
01:28:59,796 --> 01:29:03,057
J. J., I saved that woman's dog.

1234
01:29:04,852 --> 01:29:07,348
Victor, we could have won
that race.

1235
01:29:07,656 --> 01:29:09,456
You understand what I'm telling you?
We could have won!

1236
01:29:09,556 --> 01:29:10,556
You understand that?

1237
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,746
You had to go
pull that stupid stunt.

1238
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:14,260
He's right, Victor.

1239
01:29:14,623 --> 01:29:16,855
We are sick of Captain Chaos.

1240
01:29:17,055 --> 01:29:19,754
We are so sick of Captain Chaos
we could throw up.

1241
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:21,301
So you know what, Victor?

1242
01:29:21,504 --> 01:29:23,354
There's not gonna be any more
Captain Chaos.

1243
01:29:23,554 --> 01:29:26,652
No more!
You see what I'm telling you?

1244
01:29:28,752 --> 01:29:30,952
No more Captain Chaos!

1245
01:29:31,152 --> 01:29:32,452
Now, what do you think of that?

1246
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:39,883
I don't care, because...

1247
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:43,350
I've always wanted to be...

1248
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:45,250
Captain USA!

1249
01:29:50,049 --> 01:29:53,149
It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.

1250
01:30:05,847 --> 01:30:08,641
- Who won the race?
- What do you get for last?

1251
01:30:14,046 --> 01:30:18,045
How do you all feel, now that
you have raped the American highways?

1252
01:30:18,345 --> 01:30:19,845
- Beautiful. Wonderful.
- Great.

1253
01:30:20,045 --> 01:30:22,245
Old chap, I suggest
you get a grip on yourself...

1254
01:30:22,445 --> 01:30:24,129
or better, on one of these.

1255
01:30:24,855 --> 01:30:26,143
I'll take anything.

1256
01:30:26,243 --> 01:30:29,548
And feel free to use the lighter
in my car, Mr...

1257
01:30:30,042 --> 01:30:31,340
Foyt.

1258
01:30:33,642 --> 01:30:36,242
You wait till he touches
that lighter.

1259
01:30:42,647 --> 01:30:43,940
Ain't nothin' happening.

1260
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:48,044
That's funny.

1261
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,840
Excuse me.

1262
01:30:53,339 --> 01:30:56,578
Mr. Foyt,
how did you light that?

1263
01:30:57,346 --> 01:30:59,138
Well, with the lighter,
of course.

1264
01:31:01,738 --> 01:31:03,038
That's odd.

1265
01:31:13,389 --> 01:31:16,136
I've got a feeling
next year we'll do this again.

1266
01:31:20,813 --> 01:31:22,634
J. J., didn't we do good?

1267
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,700
- Stop it.
- Ready?

1268
01:32:02,755 --> 01:32:05,699
- Stop it!
- Okay. Okay.

1269
01:32:09,006 --> 01:32:10,748
Wait a minute. I got something.

1270
01:32:10,848 --> 01:32:12,698
No, this will help.

1271
01:32:12,898 --> 01:32:16,879
I'm not gonna hit you.

1272
01:32:17,096 --> 01:32:18,796
Listen to me. I swear to God.

1273
01:32:18,896 --> 01:32:21,296
I'm not gonna hit you. Watch. Watch.

1274
01:32:24,095 --> 01:32:26,372
Okay, I'm ready now.

1275
01:32:26,695 --> 01:32:28,079
Here we go.

1276
01:32:34,694 --> 01:32:36,122
Look at that shit.

1277
01:32:38,493 --> 01:32:41,093
I'm ready, I'm ready.
I swear to God, I'm ready.

1278
01:32:41,328 --> 01:32:42,458
We're off.

1279
01:32:47,792 --> 01:32:49,292
Where's he gonna sit?

1280
01:32:55,391 --> 01:32:58,053
I warned you not to interfere
in my affairs.

1281
01:32:58,224 --> 01:33:01,189
Steven, put away. Seymour. Excuse me.

1282
01:33:01,531 --> 01:33:03,890
That's all right.
I'll answer to anything.

1283
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:06,989
You see, even in the deepest
family relations...

1284
01:33:09,389 --> 01:33:11,289
My business is not worth a...

1285
01:33:13,862 --> 01:33:15,087
Thank you, Victor.

1286
01:33:16,687 --> 01:33:18,687
As you probably know, we're...

1287
01:33:18,887 --> 01:33:20,386
we're the favorites to...

1288
01:33:20,586 --> 01:33:22,286
be the winning racers tomorrow...

1289
01:33:22,486 --> 01:33:23,686
in the Cannonball...

1290
01:33:23,786 --> 01:33:27,174
Race, which is gonna be poured...

1291
01:33:27,985 --> 01:33:29,185
Good evening, ladies.

1292
01:33:29,285 --> 01:33:30,385
- Evening.
- Hello.

1293
01:33:30,485 --> 01:33:33,190
My name is J.J. McClure,
and this is my...

1294
01:33:36,084 --> 01:33:37,984
Next year we're going for the...

1295
01:33:38,184 --> 01:33:39,184
Yes?

1296
01:33:46,683 --> 01:33:48,382
Perfect. Perfect.

1297
01:33:50,982 --> 01:33:52,682
Better than...

1298
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:55,081
We have to get this woman...

1299
01:33:55,281 --> 01:33:56,781
the senator's wife...

1300
01:33:56,981 --> 01:33:58,481
to Philadelphia by...

1301
01:33:58,681 --> 01:34:00,519
Make that California, will you?

1302
01:34:02,781 --> 01:34:03,980
We're very close.

1303
01:34:13,278 --> 01:34:15,378
Because if I had enough time...

1304
01:34:15,578 --> 01:34:16,853
I would take those rosary bleeds...

1305
01:34:16,953 --> 01:34:19,058
and stuff'em up your nose.

1306
01:34:19,277 --> 01:34:21,777
- These bleeds?
- Those bleeds, yeah.

1307
01:34:21,977 --> 01:34:23,476
You're gonna take these...

1308
01:34:23,676 --> 01:34:26,476
- and shove 'em up my nose?
- I'd take these bleeds here...

1309
01:34:27,848 --> 01:34:29,076
I don't care...

1310
01:34:33,437 --> 01:34:35,677
- I don't care...
- Stop laughing!

1311
01:34:36,787 --> 01:34:38,451
I don't care, because...

1312
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:41,501
You're gonna get slapped.

1313
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,443
I always wanted to be...

1314
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:45,171
Captain America!

1315
01:34:49,273 --> 01:34:50,673
It's a living.

1316
01:34:52,372 --> 01:34:54,372
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1317
01:34:54,572 --> 01:34:58,871
He laughed... He laughed first.

1318
01:34:59,071 --> 01:35:00,971
Mr. Martin laughed first.

1319
01:35:03,971 --> 01:35:05,694
Why were you laughing?

1320
01:35:05,871 --> 01:35:08,062
He laughed and you hit me!

1321
01:35:09,255 --> 01:35:10,655
Cut it.
