1
00:01:29,897 --> 00:01:32,832
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,524
...on those accused.

3
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:38,301
On this...

4
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:42,636
This mindless aberration,
whose only means of expression...

5
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:45,175
...are wanton violence and destruction.

6
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:47,708
On the woman, Ursa...

7
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:51,412
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

8
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:55,480
...have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

9
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,420
Finally, General Zod.

10
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:01,823
Chief architect
of this intended revolution...

11
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:07,058
...and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us...

12
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:10,961
...with himself as absolute ruler.

13
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:14,373
The decision of the council
will now be heard.

14
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,838
<i>Guilty.</i>

15
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:18,037
<i>- Guilty.
- Guilty.</i>

16
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:21,605
<i>Guilty.</i>

17
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:25,851
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

18
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:29,287
It has therefore
now become your decision.

19
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:31,788
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

20
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,894
...and you alone
will be held responsible by me.

21
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:47,940
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.

22
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:49,302
I swear it.

23
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:54,470
No matter that it takes an eternity,
you will bow down before me!

24
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:55,740
Both you...

25
00:02:56,016 --> 00:02:57,108
...and then one day...

26
00:02:57,284 --> 00:02:59,184
...your heirs!

27
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,144
You will bow down before me!

28
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:36,488
- Forgive me!
- I'll be back!

29
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:37,783
Forgive me!

30
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:15,352
<i>Your mother Lara has sent you
three blankets, of red, yellow and blue.</i>

31
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,198
<i>Their protection
will ensure your strength.</i>

32
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:32,739
It's kryptonite, Superman.
A little souvenir from the old hometown.

33
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:42,474
You were great in your day, Superman.
But it just stands to reason...

34
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,084
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

35
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:48,689
...this old, diseased maniac...

36
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:50,790
...would be your banker.

37
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,162
Mind over muscle.

38
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,127
Why did you kiss me first?

39
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:36,428
It... I didn't think you'd let me later.

40
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,402
Stand aside, now.

41
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,595
Free!

42
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:06,134
Nice fresh melons.
Nice fresh melons. Get them fresh here.

43
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:09,169
Good for the cooking, huh?
Look at this, the best.

44
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,465
"Lex Luthor's scheme bombs.
Superman saves nation.

45
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:17,079
Master criminal draws harsh sentence.
Exclusive story by Lois Lane.

46
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:19,373
Photographs by James Olsen."

47
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:22,746
Luthor, you never looked lovelier.

48
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,079
Lois, terrific job.

49
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:26,221
- Thanks, chief.
- Great story, really great.

50
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:28,584
Hey, good morning, chief. You're late.

51
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:31,659
Yeah, Miss Lane, that's a great story.
One of the best.

52
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:36,161
Well, Jimmy, usually a picture isn't worth
a thousand words when I write the story...

53
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:38,163
...but in this case, congratulations.

54
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:39,699
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

55
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,206
There's Mr. Kent. Bet he wishes
he'd been around when it all happened.

56
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:46,898
Clark, he's never around
when Superman appears.

57
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:48,566
Poor guy.

58
00:12:57,754 --> 00:12:59,381
- You got a page in the front?
- Yeah.

59
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:04,824
Miss Lane got the best story.

60
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:14,136
Good morning, Lois.

61
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:16,802
Hi.

62
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:56,575
Lane, Kent, get in here!

63
00:13:56,747 --> 00:13:58,578
Now, see, Jimmy,
you got me in trouble.

64
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:01,912
- We were talking.
- So long. A big mistake.

65
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:05,085
Next time, don't do that to me.

66
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:09,051
- Good morning, Lois. How are you today?
- Oh, I'm just super. Thanks.

67
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:10,887
- Good morning, Mr. White.
- I'm super.

68
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:14,428
- Yeah, morning. You're late, Kent.
- I know. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

69
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:16,862
- I got stuck in traffic.
- Oh, that's a new one.

70
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:18,797
- Excuse me?
- I mean, as opposed to:

71
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:22,427
"I was stuck in a phone booth" or
"I got locked into the men's bathroom."

72
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:25,234
Lois, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry I was late.

73
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:28,173
If you two wanna bicker,
I have just the assignment for you.

74
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:32,338
You're gonna pose as a honeymoon couple
to get an exposé on the newlywed racket.

75
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:36,213
Some of those hotels are bilking
those poor kids for every cent they can get.

76
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:39,617
Real human-interest stuff.
Make your Aunt Hattie cry her eyes out.

77
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,916
- Newlyweds?
- That is a great idea, Mr. White.

78
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:46,722
- I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of a series...
- I mean, it wouldn't take long.

79
00:14:46,897 --> 00:14:51,391
We could just fly right up there
and zoom back down again.

80
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:53,832
No, Superman?

81
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:57,201
Yeah. If he'd give you two a ride,
maybe we could save a couple bucks.

82
00:14:57,474 --> 00:14:59,840
I gotta see young Olsen.
Six lousy photographs...

83
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,447
...and that kid's hitting me up for a raise.
- Excuse me. Mr. White? Could we talk?

84
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:06,138
Darn.

85
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:09,985
You look like the cat who swallowed
the canary this morning.

86
00:15:10,153 --> 00:15:13,987
A canary? No, actually I was
thinking of something bigger...

87
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:17,126
...something that flies,
something more in blue.

88
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:19,562
Lois, as usual, I'm totally in the dark...

89
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,961
Let me just turn on the lights
for you then.

90
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:26,631
Get the picture?

91
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:32,133
I didn't put this together until
this morning. Which is really strange...

92
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:35,608
...because a good reporter isn't supposed to
let anything slip by her.

93
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:38,213
Well, that's very amusing. Yes.

94
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:39,848
- Excuse me.
- Amusing?

95
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:44,419
- Yes, sirree, that's... That's very amusing.
- Amusing, huh?

96
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:48,750
Tall, broad shoulders...

97
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:51,184
...dark hair.

98
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:54,296
Gotta give you credit,
you really had me fooled.

99
00:15:54,464 --> 00:15:57,058
And I'm nobody's fool...

100
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:59,597
...Superman.

101
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,401
Superman?

102
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:05,735
You mean you think I'm Superman?

103
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:09,504
- Willing to bet my life on it.
- Lois, you know, you are priceless.

104
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,672
Really. That is the single most
ridiculous thing I've ever...

105
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:16,952
- Lois, what are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me die, Superman.

106
00:16:56,928 --> 00:17:00,591
- Oh, God.
- Help her out. Help her out.

107
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:03,796
- Clark!
- Lois, what have you done?

108
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:06,830
Clark, the... You're not...

109
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,773
Hey, Clark, you seen Lois?

110
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:17,510
She just stepped out for a minute.

111
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:37,924
This is how it ends for
the greatest criminal mind of our time.

112
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,366
Not with a whimper, not with a bang.

113
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:43,063
How do they choose
to reward Lex Luthor...

114
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:45,175
...the greatest genius in this world?

115
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:49,245
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

116
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:53,509
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

117
00:17:57,822 --> 00:18:00,450
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

118
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,458
I mean, California almost
fell down, right in the ocean.

119
00:18:03,628 --> 00:18:05,425
Millions of people was almost killed.

120
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:08,793
If it hadn't been for that guy
Superman, that overgrown Boy Scout.

121
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:12,197
- I want my Liberace record back tonight.
- Tonight?

122
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,433
What are you gonna do with a guy like that?
He flies around so fast and everything.

123
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:21,639
I mean, they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

124
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:24,781
Every time they try, he just flies off.

125
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:26,314
- Where?
- North.

126
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:28,314
Why?

127
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:29,783
To ski?

128
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:33,355
Otis, every man has his vulnerable point.

129
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:36,755
Some, like you, Otis,
have more than one.

130
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:38,862
I didn't see Superman's in time.

131
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,659
But now, through patience,
invention, and skill...

132
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:46,795
...my little black box
is just about ready.

133
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:50,202
Oh, that little black box in our cell?

134
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,270
That little black box, Mr. Luthor...

135
00:18:57,815 --> 00:18:59,715
...what's it for?

136
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:05,686
That little black box goes beyond
any normal, conventional radar.

137
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:08,518
It tracks alpha waves.

138
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:13,690
Alpha waves. Yeah.

139
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:16,594
<i>I could've said it tracked pasta e fagioli,
couldn't I?</i>

140
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:20,396
Oh, with garlic, Mr. Luthor. And butter.

141
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:21,970
Boy.

142
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:30,706
Those alpha waves will
take me north to his secret.

143
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:35,615
And when I have his secret,
I'll have Superman.

144
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,254
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.

145
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:49,833
Slasher Fogelstein's a bed wetter.
Pass it.

146
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:57,241
Hi, Mr. Fogelstein.

147
00:19:57,709 --> 00:20:00,234
Too fast. Can you get the speed right?

148
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:03,347
I told you, they installed those
three weeks ago.

149
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,271
Hey.

150
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:10,382
You follow the bouncing ball for a while.
Thing's giving me a headache.

151
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:13,649
Anyway, somebody's
gotta check up on those guys.

152
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:16,658
Yeah, I keep on forgetting about them.

153
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:19,592
How long they been up there, 45 days?

154
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:22,700
The whole world's forgotten about it.

155
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:27,097
<i>Houston calling Artemis II.</i>

156
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:30,739
<i>Houston calling Artemis II. Come in.</i>

157
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:33,469
<i>Morning, Houston. Hold on, Nate.</i>

158
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:35,579
<i>- Yo.
- How are things going?</i>

159
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:38,816
All systems normal, Houston.

160
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:41,885
Andy is out doing the geological survey.

161
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:44,352
<i>More rocks. Nice.</i>

162
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:47,617
And cosmonaut Boris
is getting some soil samples.

163
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:50,353
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

164
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:53,990
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

165
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,464
Just a little détente
humor there, Houston.

166
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:58,626
<i>Surface conditions unchanged?</i>

167
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:01,830
Well, it's mighty
pretty out there. Mighty...

168
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:06,034
<i>...pretty.
- Mighty pretty.</i>

169
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:08,371
<i>Right.</i>

170
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:10,612
<i>Look, Nate?</i>

171
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:12,374
<i>Nate, wake up, will you?</i>

172
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:15,111
That's it. I'm dreaming.

173
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:17,551
<i>Artemis, come in.</i>

174
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:21,817
Well, Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

175
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:23,392
Unidentified?

176
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:26,690
<i>- What does it look like?
- Well...</i>

177
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:29,561
...a lot like a girl.

178
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:52,686
You.

179
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:56,917
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

180
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:59,789
A man?

181
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:59,286
What a fragile sort of life form this is.

182
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,312
Houston, come in. Come in, Houston.

183
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,227
Come in, Houston. Come in.

184
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:39,023
Attempting manual liftoff.

185
00:23:39,232 --> 00:23:40,460
Can somebody hear me?

186
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:42,764
Houston!

187
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:44,895
Come on.

188
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:49,570
Come on, Houston!

189
00:23:50,443 --> 00:23:52,877
Oh, no. No!

190
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:55,277
Somebody help me!

191
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:04,846
<i>- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in.
- What's going on?</i>

192
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:08,460
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

193
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:10,323
Well, we really...

194
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,761
<i>Artemis, come in, please.</i>

195
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:18,798
All right, which one of you guys
is using the hair dryer?

196
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,975
Strange. I tore those
metal fibers like paper.

197
00:24:26,145 --> 00:24:30,081
And what he did was amazing.

198
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:34,686
- Something is happening.
- Yes, to all of us.

199
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:41,087
The closer we come to an
atmosphere with only one sun...

200
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,091
...a yellow sun...

201
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:47,221
...the more our molecular
density gives us unlimited powers.

202
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,197
They come from there.

203
00:24:49,368 --> 00:24:51,359
A place called Houston.

204
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:53,937
Then we will go there too...

205
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:56,040
...to rule.

206
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:59,171
Finally, to rule.

207
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:11,384
Three-eighty-two, out.

208
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,657
Three-eighty-three, out.

209
00:25:15,428 --> 00:25:17,692
Three-eighty-four, out.

210
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,962
Three-eighty-five, out.

211
00:25:24,337 --> 00:25:26,669
Lights out, Luthor.

212
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:29,469
I said, lights out.

213
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:35,741
You guys are about 10 seconds
away from solitary, you know that?

214
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,875
I told you to...

215
00:25:55,368 --> 00:25:57,529
Freeze, freeze.

216
00:26:30,404 --> 00:26:32,304
Mr. Luthor.

217
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,131
- How we gonna get over that wall?
- How'd we get in?

218
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:39,503
- We flew in here, remember?
- That's how we'll get out.

219
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,011
Oh, no, not that guy.

220
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:47,548
Did you just go "psst"?

221
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:50,884
I wish I had, Mr. Luthor, before we left.

222
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:54,790
Not that "psst," that "psst."

223
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:00,963
- Don't go "psst" when I go "psst."
- You do it.

224
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:06,632
Go out there and find it.

225
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,800
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

226
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:25,685
I think I found it.

227
00:27:30,864 --> 00:27:32,729
What is it?

228
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:36,600
It's a ladder, you dummy.

229
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,803
Hi, Miss Teschmacher.

230
00:27:47,781 --> 00:27:48,941
Come on.

231
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:53,378
Hurry up. Hurry up.

232
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:56,184
Come on, hurry.

233
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,556
Otis, hold that ladder. Hurry up.

234
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:03,560
<i>- Yard line, touchdown!
Oh, what a beautiful play.</i>

235
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,460
<i>But there's a marker downfield.
It could be against...</i>

236
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:13,096
- Come up.
- Come on.

237
00:28:13,273 --> 00:28:15,867
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

238
00:28:17,644 --> 00:28:18,804
- Get off. Get off.
- Otis!

239
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:23,310
- We're sinking!
- Get off, get off!

240
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,494
Very good,
Miss Teschmacher. Very good.

241
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:45,365
- What am I doing here? Why am I here?
- Miss Teschmacher...

242
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,439
...is this a philosophy seminar?

243
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:49,336
- No. This is a getaway.
- No.

244
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:50,737
- Getaway.
- Right.

245
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:53,903
It's ingenious. I don't know
where you got the inspiration from.

246
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,809
I got it from you, Lex.

247
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,684
Hot air rises.

248
00:29:00,554 --> 00:29:02,283
Would you like to take a trip?

249
00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:04,719
A trip? A vacation.

250
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:07,758
Lex, I can go shopping.
I can buy a bikini.

251
00:29:07,928 --> 00:29:10,328
You thought about me in a bikini
while in prison?

252
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:12,996
No, I didn't, actually.

253
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:16,432
I thought about you in a parka.

254
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:18,731
You thought about me in a parka?

255
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:21,136
You are sick, Lex. You are really sick.

256
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:23,366
That's possible.

257
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:28,978
North, Miss Teschmacher.

258
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,344
Due north.

259
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,210
Lex, north.

260
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,884
That's what I said, due north.

261
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:39,723
- That's what you said.
- I know I said I said that.

262
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:41,657
- I just heard it.
- Yes, Lex.

263
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:44,195
Don't repeat what I say
when I say something.

264
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,526
- I won't repeat what you say.
- Okay, don't.

265
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,965
Well, stop repeating me.

266
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,261
Excuse me.

267
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:24,999
Would you like to carry Mrs. Smith
over the threshold?

268
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:26,935
It's sort of traditional.

269
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:29,941
I can give you a hand
if you have trouble lifting.

270
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:33,638
- No, of course not.
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.

271
00:30:33,814 --> 00:30:35,213
Certainly, dear.

272
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,458
Mush! Mush!

273
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:49,653
I am mushing.

274
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,935
North, Miss Teschmacher.

275
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:59,198
- North, north!
- Yes, Lex. North.

276
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,865
Oh, you must be wrong, Lex.
This couldn't be his home way up here.

277
00:31:30,037 --> 00:31:31,732
"Wrong, Lex."

278
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:35,467
Miss Teschmacher, those are two words
we do not use in the same sentence.

279
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,544
Well, it's funny there's no front door.

280
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:43,514
Miss Teschmacher, "funny" is a person
trying to smile without any teeth.

281
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,009
Right.

282
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,655
All right, come on, Lex. Come on.

283
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,695
Move out of the way.

284
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,563
- This way.
- It's this way.

285
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:03,465
Lex, it's this way.

286
00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:05,537
It's this way, Lex.

287
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,068
- Come on. Come on.
- Get off!

288
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:14,305
Come on.

289
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:28,218
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.

290
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:31,397
It's fantastic!

291
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:39,003
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

292
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:44,542
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

293
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,445
- Lex.
- I'll be all right.

294
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:48,310
No, me.

295
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:54,021
Why can't you be more careful?

296
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:58,085
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

297
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,694
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

298
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:06,260
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

299
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:11,430
Be careful, Lex.

300
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:15,606
Get...!

301
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:20,445
Frankly, I think this place
is a little boring. It's all white.

302
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:22,913
Why doesn't the guy
put up some pictures?

303
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,609
Maybe some bullfighting posters.

304
00:33:29,624 --> 00:33:32,058
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

305
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,655
- Ice.
- I said, don't touch it.

306
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:39,765
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

307
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:07,959
<i>The virtuous spirit has no need
for thankful approval...</i>

308
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:10,324
<i>- What the...?
... owning a certain conviction...</i>

309
00:34:10,498 --> 00:34:13,331
<i>...that what has been done is right.</i>

310
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:15,662
That's the old man.
He looks just like the kid.

311
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:18,704
- Are you the old man?
- Ask him where the bathroom is.

312
00:34:18,874 --> 00:34:21,308
<i>Develop such conviction in yourself.</i>

313
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:22,804
Are you here?

314
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:27,004
<i>- The human heart on your planet...
- He's not here.</i>

315
00:34:27,182 --> 00:34:31,516
It's a voice from the past.
That's cute. That's really cute. Nice.

316
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:33,677
<i>Lies, monstrous deceptions.</i>

317
00:34:37,058 --> 00:34:39,526
So much for moral rearmament.

318
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:41,559
Give me another crystal.

319
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:54,966
<i>Education crystal 108. Earth culture.</i>

320
00:34:55,744 --> 00:34:59,771
<i>A typical ode much loved by the people
you will live among, Kal-El.</i>

321
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:02,542
<i>Trees by Joyce Kilmer.</i>

322
00:35:03,118 --> 00:35:04,949
<i>I think that I shall never see</i>

323
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,021
<i>A poem as lovely as a tree.</i>

324
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,448
Come on, I like trees.

325
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:14,060
So does your average cocker spaniel.
Give me another.

326
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:15,924
Cute.

327
00:35:22,404 --> 00:35:23,530
<i>My son...</i>

328
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,703
- The man never ages.
- Never ages.

329
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:31,005
<i>...the time has come to tell you of
the darkest episode in Krypton history.</i>

330
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,909
<i>- Now, this I wanna hear.
- Unfortunately...</i>

331
00:35:34,082 --> 00:35:37,381
<i>...even on our peaceful planet...</i>

332
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:39,916
<i>...there have appeared
once in a great while...</i>

333
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:43,353
<i>...certain antisocial elements.</i>

334
00:35:43,692 --> 00:35:45,091
<i>Deviants...</i>

335
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,195
<i>...what you call on Earth "criminals."</i>

336
00:35:47,463 --> 00:35:48,691
Criminals.

337
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,355
Deviants. He was right in the first place.

338
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:54,503
<i>Though of course, we are not
a penalty planet like Earth...</i>

339
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,231
<i>...and these unhappy souls were almost
always successfully transformed...</i>

340
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,308
<i>...into productive citizens.
- You never heard of Lex Luthor?</i>

341
00:36:01,477 --> 00:36:04,810
<i>There were, however, three exceptions...
Only three.</i>

342
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:07,677
<i>Who proved impossible to rehabilitate.</i>

343
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:09,509
There's hope.

344
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:11,846
<i>Non, the destroyer.</i>

345
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:16,321
<i>Unreasoning violence
in the shape of a being.</i>

346
00:36:17,226 --> 00:36:21,060
<i>Ursa. Vicious, cruel, obsessed
by a single-minded hatred...</i>

347
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,255
<i>...which could never be determined.</i>

348
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,400
<i>And the one force
that could unite them...</i>

349
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:30,130
<i>...the only one whose warped genius
could harness these forces of evil:</i>

350
00:36:30,306 --> 00:36:31,568
<i>General Zod.</i>

351
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:34,608
<i>- He looks kind of cute.
- His intended insurrection...</i>

352
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:39,110
<i>...was the most painful episode
our people ever had to endure.</i>

353
00:36:39,548 --> 00:36:41,607
<i>But after a long and terrible battle...</i>

354
00:36:42,218 --> 00:36:44,880
<i>...peace and harmony
were once again restored.</i>

355
00:36:45,054 --> 00:36:46,578
Kind of an anticlimax.

356
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:50,123
<i>We had, of course, no death penalty.</i>

357
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:52,084
Sensible enough.

358
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:55,654
<i>And so they were placed
in the Phantom Zone...</i>

359
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:02,664
<i>...to be imprisoned for all eternity.</i>

360
00:37:03,372 --> 00:37:06,603
<i>I do not know what could be done
if they were to escape.</i>

361
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:09,537
<i>On Krypton, these
villains were uncontrollable.</i>

362
00:37:09,712 --> 00:37:14,445
<i>On Earth, each of them
would have the identical powers...</i>

363
00:37:15,351 --> 00:37:17,114
<i>...that you have.</i>

364
00:37:19,855 --> 00:37:21,982
Think of it. Three super villains.

365
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:25,059
All three with the same power he has.

366
00:37:25,227 --> 00:37:29,391
All three totally dedicated
to corruption, violence, evil.

367
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,201
They need a contact on Earth.

368
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:37,201
Someone who felt the same as they did,
someone who...

369
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:41,810
...had the same wonderful contempt for
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

370
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:44,772
Too true to be good.

371
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:47,380
Right?

372
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:56,654
- Miss Teschmacher?
- I found it.

373
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:58,923
I think.

374
00:37:59,261 --> 00:38:02,560
- Where's Jimmy Olsen when I need him?
- Golly, isn't it beautiful?

375
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:05,598
Yeah, it's gorgeous. Gorgeous.

376
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:07,063
- Lois?
- Yeah?

377
00:38:07,236 --> 00:38:12,071
Look. Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands too, huh?

378
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:15,335
- Here's my hand, Clark. Hold it.
- Thanks.

379
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:18,738
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

380
00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:21,849
- Why?
- They let go, straight to the lawyer.

381
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:24,884
Oh, I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

382
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:27,420
That's because you're blind, Clark.

383
00:38:27,857 --> 00:38:29,449
- Oh, yeah.
- Here.

384
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,456
- No, I've got it. No, I...
- Yeah. Clark.

385
00:38:31,627 --> 00:38:34,721
You've gotta look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

386
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,558
- God.
- Lois?

387
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:37,892
- Now, here.
- Right.

388
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:40,934
- Don't say I never did anything for you.
- Thank you.

389
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,039
Son! Excuse me, please.

390
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,706
- Be careful.
- What are you doing?

391
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:49,902
Get down! Get down!

392
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:56,073
You embarrass me
here in front of everybody.

393
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:01,945
Lois, did you see what almost
happened there? That little boy...

394
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:05,818
Hey, I'm hungry. You hungry?

395
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:08,328
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Why, because I'm hungry?

396
00:39:08,498 --> 00:39:12,332
No. Here you are standing in front of one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

397
00:39:12,502 --> 00:39:15,471
...and you're thinking about
food. Aren't you impressed?

398
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:19,075
Clark, once a girl's seen
Superman in action...

399
00:39:19,242 --> 00:39:21,733
...Niagara Falls kind of
leaves you cold, you know?

400
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:23,675
Him again, huh?

401
00:39:24,748 --> 00:39:26,181
Oh, I'm sorry.

402
00:39:26,383 --> 00:39:28,647
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

403
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:32,015
Well, my one-track mind is
telling me that I'm hungry.

404
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:33,281
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

405
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:34,855
Hot dog.

406
00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:36,583
Could I have some orange juice?

407
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,819
- Freshly squeezed.
- Freshly squeezed, I know.

408
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:48,127
Hey, Mom. Look!

409
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,296
Yeah, honey. That's nice.

410
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:56,374
Okay, it's two mustard and relish, and...

411
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:01,807
Oh, my God!

412
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:04,477
Help!

413
00:40:04,654 --> 00:40:06,417
Help!

414
00:40:07,624 --> 00:40:09,854
Somebody help!

415
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:13,126
Do something!

416
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,656
Good.

417
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,300
Hey, Superman!

418
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:24,836
Way to go, Superman!

419
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:29,303
We got a great shot.

420
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:32,471
What a nice man.
Of course he's Jewish.

421
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,609
Incredible.

422
00:40:45,161 --> 00:40:47,459
- There you go.
- Again, again!

423
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:50,862
No, I'm sorry.
Only one ride to a customer.

424
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:54,993
- Superman. Superman, it's me, it's Lois!
- Bye.

425
00:40:55,171 --> 00:40:57,366
Come here. You're gonna get it!

426
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,976
- Give me a heart attack here.
- It's me. It's Lois.

427
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:03,305
It's Lois Lane.

428
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,440
Well, hello and goodbye.

429
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:35,207
So this is planet Houston.

430
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:39,575
A very strange surface.

431
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:09,673
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, that's all right.

432
00:42:09,846 --> 00:42:12,838
- I just didn't hear you knock, that's all.
- Lois...

433
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:16,508
...the door wasn't even locked.
Just anybody can walk in here.

434
00:42:16,686 --> 00:42:19,315
- There you go putting yourself down again.
- Very funny.

435
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,583
No, really, I'm serious.

436
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:24,388
Well, anyway...

437
00:42:24,562 --> 00:42:27,793
...here, a little something for
the newlyweds' dinner tonight.

438
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:30,627
Pansies. Clark, how...
How different.

439
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:33,201
Would you believe
they grow wild all around here?

440
00:42:33,371 --> 00:42:35,669
You should see what they
charge for roses at the gift shop.

441
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,603
I'll bet, huh?

442
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,734
- You know something, Lois?
- What?

443
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:45,405
Well, you know, in spite of
the unreality of all this...

444
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:48,848
Well, you know, posing as newlyweds
for the sake of a newspaper story.

445
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:51,078
Well, in spite of myself even...

446
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:53,985
...I'm kind of starting to
feel like one in a way.

447
00:42:54,158 --> 00:42:57,753
- A newlywed, you?
- I don't see why that should be so strange.

448
00:42:57,928 --> 00:42:59,555
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

449
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,858
I mean, I'm sure there's
thousands of girls who'd...

450
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:05,164
Well, a few girls anyway.

451
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:07,327
- Go ahead and say it.
- Say what?

452
00:43:07,505 --> 00:43:12,966
That somehow you're not satisfied
being here with me.

453
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:18,846
That in some way I don't seem to
shape up very well in your eyes.

454
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:21,849
I don't have anything to apologize for.
I'm a good reporter.

455
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:26,080
No, I'm a very good reporter.
And an even better friend to you.

456
00:43:27,091 --> 00:43:28,558
- Stand up.
- Stand up?

457
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:30,326
Yeah, stand up, just for fun.

458
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:36,459
Now, come here. Look at yourself.
Just look at yourself.

459
00:43:37,468 --> 00:43:41,632
What we have here is
a potentially aggressive, dynamite guy...

460
00:43:41,806 --> 00:43:43,433
...who can do anything he wants.

461
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:46,269
I mean, it's not my fault
you keep putting yourself down.

462
00:43:46,444 --> 00:43:48,469
- Oh, yeah? How?
- Well, for starters...

463
00:43:48,646 --> 00:43:51,114
...you slouch all the time.
Here, stand up straight.

464
00:43:51,282 --> 00:43:52,874
There, that's better.

465
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:56,508
And get yourself a jacket with a vent
and shoes that don't lace up...

466
00:43:56,687 --> 00:44:00,487
...and a shirt with a little color
or a pattern or something.

467
00:44:00,658 --> 00:44:03,252
And a bow tie that doesn't look
like a letter opener.

468
00:44:03,427 --> 00:44:05,691
All right, Lois. All right.

469
00:44:05,863 --> 00:44:09,299
- We've been through this, haven't we?
- Yes.

470
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,035
I know where this is all leading to.

471
00:44:14,472 --> 00:44:17,236
And I'm sorry. I mean, I'm sorry...

472
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:20,275
...but no matter how hard I try, I just...

473
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:23,004
Just... Just never will be him.

474
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,545
Him who?

475
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:28,242
"Him who"? Him Superman.

476
00:44:28,419 --> 00:44:31,616
Now, I can't help the fact that
you seem to think that you love him.

477
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:35,452
That's something I'll have to live with.
But darn it, Lois, that's enough now.

478
00:44:36,594 --> 00:44:39,154
Maybe I just can't stand
the competition anymore.

479
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,663
And just maybe you've been
the competition all along.

480
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:45,233
Lois, I've never been
particularly good at riddles.

481
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:47,666
Let me make this one really easy for you.

482
00:44:47,905 --> 00:44:51,841
Why, with thousands of children
potentially falling off something lethal...

483
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:55,877
...all around the world, would Superman
be in Niagara Falls today?

484
00:44:56,046 --> 00:44:57,445
Why not the Grand Canyon?

485
00:44:57,615 --> 00:45:01,449
- Ask the child's family. I'm sure they know.
- Why is it always when I'm with you...

486
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:05,077
...until Superman appears?
And then you seem to disappear.

487
00:45:05,256 --> 00:45:08,987
- Very conveniently, it seems to me.
- I was out for hot dogs. For Pete's sake...

488
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:11,855
When Superman appeared,
I looked at that hot dog stand...

489
00:45:12,029 --> 00:45:13,257
...and you were gone.

490
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,624
- I was...
- Nowhere.

491
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,134
I can't help it if I had to go to the...

492
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:21,199
You are Superman, aren't you?

493
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:24,864
Lois, look, we've been through
these hallucinations of yours before.

494
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:26,839
Can't you see what you almost did?

495
00:45:27,011 --> 00:45:29,275
Throwing yourself off a building
30 stories high?

496
00:45:29,446 --> 00:45:31,676
Can't you see the tragic mistake
you almost made?

497
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:35,786
Yeah, I made a mistake.
I made a mistake because...

498
00:45:37,656 --> 00:45:39,647
...I risked my life instead of yours.

499
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:41,883
Lois, don't be insane.

500
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,257
And don't fall down because
you're just gonna have to get up again.

501
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,489
Lois, now, don't be crazy now. Lois!

502
00:46:00,378 --> 00:46:01,572
It is you.

503
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:10,845
I guess I've known this
for the longest time.

504
00:46:13,725 --> 00:46:15,522
You realize, of course...

505
00:46:15,694 --> 00:46:18,686
...if you'd been wrong,
Clark Kent would have been killed.

506
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:21,827
With a blank?

507
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:27,398
Gotcha.

508
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:54,426
A primitive sort of life form.

509
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:04,803
Did you see that?

510
00:47:06,111 --> 00:47:08,306
Did you see what I did?

511
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,040
I have powers beyond reason here.

512
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:13,180
We all have them, my dear.

513
00:47:55,593 --> 00:47:58,721
- Wow, this is your home?
- No.

514
00:47:58,897 --> 00:48:01,957
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

515
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:05,767
No, this is a very special place for me.

516
00:48:05,937 --> 00:48:08,235
I wanted you to see it.

517
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,835
Listen, you warm enough?

518
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,169
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.

519
00:48:14,345 --> 00:48:15,972
Good.

520
00:48:16,147 --> 00:48:18,308
Come on, let me show you.

521
00:48:37,268 --> 00:48:38,462
I don't know.

522
00:48:39,404 --> 00:48:42,601
From the look of them,
I'll bet $ 10 they're from Los Angeles.

523
00:48:51,951 --> 00:48:55,819
Hey, you hippies,
get your butts off the road!

524
00:48:56,188 --> 00:48:59,282
I like the globe. It flashes
red like our Krypton sun.

525
00:48:59,692 --> 00:49:01,887
But not this irritating noise.

526
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:04,392
Make way.

527
00:49:05,264 --> 00:49:07,027
Did I hear right?

528
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:08,996
That son of a bitch give me an order?

529
00:49:09,535 --> 00:49:11,526
Duane, you take care of it.

530
00:49:16,575 --> 00:49:19,339
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

531
00:49:19,512 --> 00:49:21,537
What is this symbol?

532
00:49:21,714 --> 00:49:23,511
Do you follow another leader?

533
00:49:23,682 --> 00:49:26,014
Follow the leader?

534
00:49:27,186 --> 00:49:29,552
Holy skunk sweat.

535
00:49:29,722 --> 00:49:31,917
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort.

536
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:43,496
How the hell did you do that?

537
00:49:51,143 --> 00:49:52,576
Jesus H. Christ.

538
00:49:55,114 --> 00:49:58,515
- That was good.
- I thought we might...

539
00:49:59,985 --> 00:50:02,579
...abandon the orange juice for once.

540
00:50:09,962 --> 00:50:12,624
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

541
00:50:16,936 --> 00:50:20,030
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

542
00:50:20,406 --> 00:50:23,136
No. No, I really...

543
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:25,470
I really like it sometimes.

544
00:50:25,644 --> 00:50:27,805
Even though I do
make a fool of myself.

545
00:50:29,515 --> 00:50:33,952
But, you know, if it weren't for him,
I never would have met you.

546
00:50:35,855 --> 00:50:39,291
But he is you.

547
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:43,392
- It's kind of confusing.
- Not to me, it isn't.

548
00:50:45,831 --> 00:50:47,264
Everything's clear.

549
00:50:51,937 --> 00:50:55,703
Until yesterday, a middle-American town
that Middle America had forgotten.

550
00:50:55,875 --> 00:51:00,278
But today, the population...
Exaggerated reports put it at 123.

551
00:51:00,446 --> 00:51:01,879
Has increased by three.

552
00:51:02,047 --> 00:51:05,073
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

553
00:51:05,251 --> 00:51:07,947
As I look west into
East Houston this morning...

554
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,317
<i>...I see a town gripped with fear.
- Who's the guy?</i>

555
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,458
<i>Get that guy. Follow the guy.</i>

556
00:51:13,626 --> 00:51:15,253
<i>Who's the big guy?</i>

557
00:51:16,061 --> 00:51:17,961
<i>Okay, yeah, we've got a...</i>

558
00:51:18,297 --> 00:51:19,992
<i>- You got that?
- No.</i>

559
00:51:24,303 --> 00:51:26,100
<i>- That's fine.
- Try to wiggle it.</i>

560
00:51:26,272 --> 00:51:28,206
Who else is seeing this?

561
00:51:28,374 --> 00:51:32,242
Well, with this satellite linkup,
just about everybody. The whole planet.

562
00:51:32,411 --> 00:51:34,606
The whole planet Houston?

563
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:38,147
Earth. The whole planet Earth.

564
00:51:40,452 --> 00:51:42,511
You may continue.

565
00:51:42,688 --> 00:51:46,351
As the extraordinary story continues...

566
00:51:47,393 --> 00:51:49,418
- Enough of this man.
- As this extraordinary...

567
00:51:49,595 --> 00:51:53,031
If the whole planet is watching,
let's show them something interesting.

568
00:51:53,198 --> 00:51:55,928
<i>Throw down your arms and surrender!</i>

569
00:51:56,502 --> 00:51:58,970
<i>This is an order.</i>

570
00:52:01,006 --> 00:52:04,567
General Zod does not
take orders. He gives them.

571
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:29,959
He was in the line of that fire
and nothing happened to him.

572
00:52:30,136 --> 00:52:32,400
I haven't seen the likes
of this since Superman.

573
00:52:33,306 --> 00:52:35,035
<i>Yes? Yes.</i>

574
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:39,941
<i>The Newsbeat control room has informed
me that a fleet of helicopter gunships is...</i>

575
00:52:40,113 --> 00:52:43,640
- Mr. President, sir, can't we...?
- There's nothing anybody can do.

576
00:52:43,817 --> 00:52:46,115
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

577
00:52:46,286 --> 00:52:47,719
Where's Superman?

578
00:52:47,887 --> 00:52:50,947
Where is he?
Why doesn't he do something?

579
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:04,564
<i>Fire again.</i>

580
00:53:06,873 --> 00:53:08,340
<i>Fire again.</i>

581
00:53:11,578 --> 00:53:15,036
Look. They need machines to fly.

582
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:18,511
<i>- Banking now.
- What bravery.</i>

583
00:53:18,852 --> 00:53:22,811
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

584
00:53:25,725 --> 00:53:28,421
<i>Rockets ready. Coming in on target.
Wait, wait.</i>

585
00:53:30,563 --> 00:53:31,757
<i>We're out of control.</i>

586
00:53:33,867 --> 00:53:37,166
<i>We're coming in, coming down.
Can't control it!</i>

587
00:53:37,337 --> 00:53:38,599
<i>We're coming down.</i>

588
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:46,511
I win.

589
00:53:47,914 --> 00:53:50,007
I always win.

590
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:54,484
Is there no one on
this planet to even challenge me?

591
00:54:14,474 --> 00:54:15,941
Come forward.

592
00:54:16,276 --> 00:54:18,176
Your general wishes to speak.

593
00:54:18,445 --> 00:54:22,677
I am General Zod, your ruler.

594
00:54:24,017 --> 00:54:28,044
Yes, today begins a new order!

595
00:54:28,321 --> 00:54:30,789
Your lands, your possessions...

596
00:54:30,957 --> 00:54:35,917
...your very lives will gladly be
given in tribute to me.

597
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:38,624
In return for your obedience...

598
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:41,460
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

599
00:54:41,634 --> 00:54:45,502
In other words,
you will be allowed to live.

600
00:54:48,007 --> 00:54:50,999
So you are a general?

601
00:54:52,045 --> 00:54:54,206
And who is your superior?

602
00:54:54,981 --> 00:55:00,112
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me.

603
00:55:01,387 --> 00:55:05,187
Or all of his cities
will end up like this one.

604
00:55:11,197 --> 00:55:14,826
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

605
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:18,129
Imagine what they'll do
to the world if we resist.

606
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:25,375
<i>The people of your planet
are well-pleased with you, Kal-El.</i>

607
00:55:25,546 --> 00:55:29,277
<i>You have served them faithfully,
and they are grateful for it.</i>

608
00:55:31,185 --> 00:55:36,213
<i>And yet you have returned
to reason with me once again.</i>

609
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:41,661
<i>My son, I have tried to anticipate
your every question.</i>

610
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:43,660
<i>This was one I'd...</i>

611
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:47,033
<i>I'd hoped you would not ask.</i>

612
00:55:50,204 --> 00:55:52,172
My attachment...

613
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:59,510
...the feelings which I have developed
for a certain human being...

614
00:55:59,813 --> 00:56:02,145
...have deeply affected me, Father.

615
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:06,776
<i>You cannot serve humanity by investing
your time and emotion in one human being...</i>

616
00:56:06,954 --> 00:56:09,081
<i>...at the expense of the rest.</i>

617
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:14,091
<i>- The concepts are mutally exclusive.
- And...</i>

618
00:56:15,896 --> 00:56:20,094
...if I no longer wish
to serve humanity...

619
00:56:21,035 --> 00:56:24,471
<i>Is this how you repay their gratitude?</i>

620
00:56:24,638 --> 00:56:28,438
<i>By abandoning the weak,
the defenseless, the needy...</i>

621
00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:31,237
<i>...for the sake of your selfish pursuits?</i>

622
00:56:31,445 --> 00:56:34,881
Selfish? After all I've done for them?

623
00:56:35,049 --> 00:56:37,643
Will there ever come a time
when I've served enough?

624
00:56:37,818 --> 00:56:40,378
At least they get a chance for happiness.

625
00:56:40,554 --> 00:56:43,182
I only ask as much, no more.

626
00:56:43,924 --> 00:56:46,620
<i>Yours is a higher happiness.</i>

627
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:51,163
<i>The fulfillment of your mission,
an inspiration you must have felt.</i>

628
00:56:51,765 --> 00:56:54,700
<i>You must have felt
that happiness within you.</i>

629
00:56:55,002 --> 00:56:58,130
<i>My son, surely you cannot
deny that feeling.</i>

630
00:56:58,505 --> 00:57:01,838
No, I cannot...

631
00:57:02,543 --> 00:57:06,377
...any more than I can deny the other,
which is stronger in me, Father.

632
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:09,043
So much stronger.

633
00:57:15,055 --> 00:57:17,182
Is there no way then, Father?

634
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:21,784
Must I finally be denied
the one thing in life which I truly desire?

635
00:57:23,464 --> 00:57:26,262
<i>If you will not be Kal-El...</i>

636
00:57:26,634 --> 00:57:28,568
<i>...if you will live as one of them...</i>

637
00:57:29,136 --> 00:57:31,127
<i>...love their kind as one of them...</i>

638
00:57:31,705 --> 00:57:33,900
<i>...then it follows that you must...</i>

639
00:57:34,608 --> 00:57:36,701
<i>...become one of them.</i>

640
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:11,041
<i>This crystal chamber has in it the
harnessed rays of the red sun of Krypton.</i>

641
00:58:11,545 --> 00:58:12,944
<i>Once exposed to them...</i>

642
00:58:13,113 --> 00:58:16,640
<i>...all your great powers
on Earth will disappear.</i>

643
00:58:17,584 --> 00:58:19,074
<i>Forever.</i>

644
00:58:19,753 --> 00:58:21,778
<i>Once this is done, there's no going back.</i>

645
00:58:23,257 --> 00:58:25,657
<i>You will feel like an ordinary man.</i>

646
00:58:26,694 --> 00:58:29,754
<i>And you can be harmed
like an ordinary man.</i>

647
00:58:31,965 --> 00:58:33,830
<i>Think, Kal-El.</i>

648
00:58:35,269 --> 00:58:36,930
<i>I beg you.</i>

649
00:58:38,005 --> 00:58:39,633
Father...

650
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:42,103
...I love her.

651
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,651
<i>Think, Kal-El.</i>

652
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,141
Come on. Come on.

653
01:01:11,025 --> 01:01:12,219
Look out!

654
01:02:03,445 --> 01:02:05,345
You are the one they call president?

655
01:02:06,115 --> 01:02:07,742
I am.

656
01:02:09,818 --> 01:02:13,686
I see you are practiced
in worshipping things that fly.

657
01:02:15,057 --> 01:02:16,752
Good.

658
01:02:17,626 --> 01:02:19,787
Rise before Zod.

659
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:26,735
Now, kneel before Zod.

660
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:42,474
You are not the president.

661
01:02:42,785 --> 01:02:47,552
No one who leads so many
could possibly kneel so quickly.

662
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:49,520
I am the man they are protecting.

663
01:02:50,859 --> 01:02:52,724
I am the president.

664
01:02:53,662 --> 01:02:55,892
I'll kneel before you
if it will save lives.

665
01:02:56,332 --> 01:02:58,061
It will.

666
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,793
Starting with your own.

667
01:03:04,506 --> 01:03:07,703
What a backward planet this must be...

668
01:03:08,143 --> 01:03:10,976
...where the men wear the ribbons...

669
01:03:11,513 --> 01:03:13,140
...and the jewelry.

670
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:28,495
What I do now...

671
01:03:28,664 --> 01:03:31,861
...I do for the sake of
the people of the world.

672
01:03:32,034 --> 01:03:36,027
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

673
01:03:36,338 --> 01:03:39,603
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

674
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,766
I wish I knew.

675
01:03:46,115 --> 01:03:47,480
Oh, God.

676
01:03:47,983 --> 01:03:49,507
Zod.

677
01:03:52,154 --> 01:03:53,587
Hey.

678
01:03:53,756 --> 01:03:56,281
You're awfully quiet over there.

679
01:03:57,993 --> 01:04:01,292
Yeah, I was just thinking...

680
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,990
...I can't believe what
you've given up for me.

681
01:04:05,801 --> 01:04:09,328
Are you kidding? I didn't do
it for you, Lois, I did it for us.

682
01:04:09,938 --> 01:04:12,998
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

683
01:04:13,175 --> 01:04:17,111
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

684
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:19,008
Hurry up.

685
01:04:19,181 --> 01:04:21,081
- Come on.
- Okay.

686
01:04:24,286 --> 01:04:26,618
Come on, it's my treat. Come on.

687
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:32,725
Oh, boy, it's Mr. Wonderful.

688
01:04:34,363 --> 01:04:36,627
Thank you.

689
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:41,597
- Do you have a men's room?
- Yeah. Right in the corner.

690
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:44,295
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

691
01:04:46,275 --> 01:04:47,765
Hi, what would you folks like?

692
01:04:47,943 --> 01:04:51,538
I'd like a cheeseburger with
everything on it, and a Coke...

693
01:04:51,714 --> 01:04:55,377
...an order of fries
and a side salad, please.

694
01:04:56,418 --> 01:04:59,410
- And for you, sir?
- I'll think about it when I get back.

695
01:04:59,588 --> 01:05:01,112
Right. That's one cheeseburger...

696
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:04,018
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- Can I have my Coke?

697
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:05,956
Coming right up.

698
01:05:06,328 --> 01:05:09,820
- I'm sorry, that seat's taken.
- It is now, sweetheart.

699
01:05:10,967 --> 01:05:12,935
Can I buy you something to eat?

700
01:05:13,603 --> 01:05:15,298
No, thank you.

701
01:05:16,206 --> 01:05:18,504
Excuse me. I think
you're sitting in my seat.

702
01:05:19,342 --> 01:05:21,833
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

703
01:05:24,848 --> 01:05:28,716
Gee, I think perhaps somebody
ought to teach you some manners, sir.

704
01:05:29,853 --> 01:05:32,344
Yeah? Well, let me
know when he comes in.

705
01:05:32,522 --> 01:05:35,013
- Look, Clark, we can just...
- Honey.

706
01:05:36,326 --> 01:05:38,726
Excuse me, sir, would
you care to step outside?

707
01:05:38,928 --> 01:05:41,658
I said, excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

708
01:05:44,934 --> 01:05:47,664
Now, listen, Rocky,
your steak's coming right up.

709
01:05:48,238 --> 01:05:52,004
Keep it on the flame, Ron.
This is just a minute steak.

710
01:05:53,243 --> 01:05:54,801
After you.

711
01:05:55,478 --> 01:05:57,343
- Clark.
- It's all right, honey.

712
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:01,742
Clark!

713
01:06:03,953 --> 01:06:05,386
You all right, fella?

714
01:06:05,555 --> 01:06:08,319
He's gonna be fine,
just give me that.

715
01:06:08,658 --> 01:06:12,185
- Clark?
- Blood. It's my blood.

716
01:06:13,029 --> 01:06:17,227
I think maybe we ought to
hire a bodyguard from now on.

717
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,858
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.

718
01:06:21,037 --> 01:06:23,164
I know that, Lois.

719
01:06:23,339 --> 01:06:25,569
I wish he were here.

720
01:06:31,247 --> 01:06:32,976
Clark.

721
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:37,581
Boy, you just don't have
enough sense to stay down, do you?

722
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:48,759
You... You... You are no good.

723
01:06:49,499 --> 01:06:51,694
Settle down!

724
01:06:52,268 --> 01:06:54,702
I don't like your meat anyway.

725
01:06:56,873 --> 01:06:58,738
Oh, God.

726
01:07:05,815 --> 01:07:08,784
Clark? Clark?

727
01:07:08,952 --> 01:07:10,749
Clark, can you get up?

728
01:07:10,954 --> 01:07:13,616
- All right. Come on. I got you.
- Go slow. Go slow.

729
01:07:13,823 --> 01:07:15,586
Try and get up in that chair.

730
01:07:17,427 --> 01:07:20,089
- Sit down.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

731
01:07:21,531 --> 01:07:25,126
Okay, everybody, he's all right.
Just relax. We'll have some fresh coffee.

732
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:27,599
I'll turn the box on.

733
01:07:28,438 --> 01:07:31,271
<i>We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...</i>

734
01:07:31,441 --> 01:07:34,342
<i>...from the President
of the United States.</i>

735
01:07:34,577 --> 01:07:36,909
<i>This is your president.</i>

736
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:42,015
<i>On behalf of my country, and in the
name of the other leaders of the world...</i>

737
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:45,248
<i>...with whom I have today consulted...</i>

738
01:07:45,788 --> 01:07:48,552
<i>...I hereby abdicate...</i>

739
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:53,057
<i>...all authority and
control over this planet...</i>

740
01:07:53,596 --> 01:07:55,120
<i>...to General Zod.</i>

741
01:07:55,932 --> 01:07:57,126
Zod.

742
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,827
<i>Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...</i>

743
01:08:01,638 --> 01:08:05,597
<i>...will the lives of
innocent millions be spared.</i>

744
01:08:06,142 --> 01:08:07,734
<i>Superman, can you hear me?</i>

745
01:08:07,911 --> 01:08:11,677
<i>- Superman, where...?
- Who is this Superman?</i>

746
01:08:11,848 --> 01:08:17,912
<i>- You'll find out. And when you do...
- Come to me, Superman, if you dare.</i>

747
01:08:18,087 --> 01:08:19,679
<i>I defy you.</i>

748
01:08:19,856 --> 01:08:23,314
<i>Come! Come and kneel before Zod.</i>

749
01:08:25,762 --> 01:08:27,196
<i>Zod!</i>

750
01:08:28,766 --> 01:08:30,529
- Here? When?
- When?

751
01:08:30,701 --> 01:08:34,467
Where the hell have you been, Mac?
On a desert island?

752
01:08:37,207 --> 01:08:38,936
I have to go back.

753
01:08:39,109 --> 01:08:41,077
You can't go back.

754
01:08:41,245 --> 01:08:43,770
- There's no way now.
- I have to.

755
01:08:43,948 --> 01:08:47,145
I've gotta try, damn it. I've
gotta try something, anything.

756
01:08:47,318 --> 01:08:50,185
It's not your fault.

757
01:08:50,354 --> 01:08:53,755
You didn't know this was gonna happen.

758
01:08:55,159 --> 01:08:56,990
He knew.

759
01:08:57,161 --> 01:08:59,425
I heard him.

760
01:08:59,596 --> 01:09:01,860
I just didn't listen.

761
01:09:18,515 --> 01:09:21,109
You're master of all you survey.

762
01:09:21,318 --> 01:09:23,252
And so I was yesterday.

763
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,911
And the day before.

764
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:41,064
Hello, there.

765
01:09:42,639 --> 01:09:44,539
Lex Luthor.

766
01:09:46,944 --> 01:09:49,071
Lex Luthor.

767
01:09:49,546 --> 01:09:52,447
You've heard the name?
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.

768
01:09:52,983 --> 01:09:55,611
I told you this was a puny planet.

769
01:09:55,786 --> 01:09:57,413
Wait just a moment.

770
01:09:57,588 --> 01:10:00,716
Wait until you get to know
me better. Will you, please?

771
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:04,588
Wait. Look, I can give
you anything you want.

772
01:10:04,762 --> 01:10:06,753
I can give you the brass ring...

773
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:11,663
...the unlimited freedom
to maim, kill, destroy.

774
01:10:12,169 --> 01:10:16,765
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

775
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:21,274
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...

776
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,648
We have all of this without you.

777
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:28,611
You cannot bargain
with what you don't have.

778
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:31,480
Magnificent One...

779
01:10:32,456 --> 01:10:35,857
...what I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

780
01:10:36,026 --> 01:10:37,391
The son of Jor-El.

781
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:43,496
The son of Jor-El?

782
01:10:43,867 --> 01:10:45,357
I said that, didn't I?

783
01:10:45,869 --> 01:10:48,531
Jor-El, our jailer?

784
01:10:48,772 --> 01:10:50,933
No, Jor-El, the baseball player.

785
01:10:51,108 --> 01:10:53,099
Yes, Jor-El, your jailer.

786
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:56,902
- The son of Jor-El? On this planet?
- Aye.

787
01:10:57,081 --> 01:10:59,675
<i>Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage...</i>

788
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:02,944
...or his name he travels under:

789
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,917
Superman.

790
01:11:07,224 --> 01:11:08,885
So this is Superman.

791
01:11:10,227 --> 01:11:11,524
How do you know of Jor-El?

792
01:11:11,695 --> 01:11:16,132
My Fullness, as I
explained to you before...

793
01:11:17,201 --> 01:11:18,691
...I'm about the best there is.

794
01:11:18,869 --> 01:11:20,166
Revenge.

795
01:11:20,337 --> 01:11:22,328
We will kill the son of our jailer.

796
01:11:22,506 --> 01:11:25,475
- Revenge.
- Revenge! Now we're cooking.

797
01:11:25,676 --> 01:11:27,667
- He flies, then?
- Constantly.

798
01:11:27,845 --> 01:11:29,870
- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly.

799
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:34,381
But, Magnificent One...

800
01:11:34,551 --> 01:11:37,384
...he's just one...

801
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:40,114
...where you are three.

802
01:11:40,858 --> 01:11:44,260
- Or four, if you count him twice.
- We will bring him to his knees.

803
01:11:44,529 --> 01:11:46,190
Wait!

804
01:11:47,765 --> 01:11:49,027
First, you must find him.

805
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:52,633
And Lex Baby is the only
one who knows where he is.

806
01:11:54,172 --> 01:11:56,663
What do you want?

807
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:59,002
Well, general...

808
01:11:59,177 --> 01:12:01,737
...the world is a big place.

809
01:12:01,913 --> 01:12:04,347
Thank goodness...

810
01:12:04,516 --> 01:12:06,484
...my needs are small.

811
01:12:07,919 --> 01:12:13,755
As it turns out, I have this
affinity for beachfront property.

812
01:12:15,493 --> 01:12:17,984
What do you want?

813
01:12:18,163 --> 01:12:19,926
Australia.

814
01:12:51,462 --> 01:12:52,986
Hey.

815
01:12:55,733 --> 01:13:00,193
Listen... Hey, come on,
where are you...? Please!

816
01:13:37,775 --> 01:13:39,367
Father?

817
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:44,039
If you can hear me...

818
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:47,650
...I failed.

819
01:13:50,054 --> 01:13:51,954
I failed you...

820
01:13:52,257 --> 01:13:54,020
...I failed myself...

821
01:13:55,893 --> 01:13:57,986
...and all humanity.

822
01:14:00,898 --> 01:14:03,059
I've traded my birthright...

823
01:14:04,168 --> 01:14:08,969
...for a life of submission in a world
that's now ruled by your enemies.

824
01:14:10,675 --> 01:14:13,166
There's nobody left to help them now...

825
01:14:13,978 --> 01:14:15,912
...the people of the world.

826
01:14:16,981 --> 01:14:19,006
Not since I...

827
01:14:19,917 --> 01:14:23,045
Father!

828
01:15:34,109 --> 01:15:38,705
<i>Listen carefully, my son,
for we shall never speak again.</i>

829
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:43,176
<i>If you hear me now...</i>

830
01:15:43,351 --> 01:15:46,377
<i>...then you have made use
of the only means left to you:</i>

831
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:51,225
<i>The crystal source through which
our communications begun.</i>

832
01:15:52,194 --> 01:15:54,594
<i>The circle is now complete.</i>

833
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:58,160
<i>You have made a dreadful mistake, Kal-El.</i>

834
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:05,097
<i>You did this of your own free will...</i>

835
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,438
<i>...in spite of all I could say
to dissuade you.</i>

836
01:16:10,745 --> 01:16:12,337
I...

837
01:16:12,514 --> 01:16:17,008
<i>Now you have returned to me
for one last chance to redeem yourself.</i>

838
01:16:17,185 --> 01:16:22,088
<i>This too finally I have anticipated,
my son.</i>

839
01:16:24,759 --> 01:16:26,920
<i>Look at me, Kal-El.</i>

840
01:16:29,364 --> 01:16:33,960
<i>Once before when you were small,
I died...</i>

841
01:16:35,203 --> 01:16:38,172
<i>...while giving you a chance for life.</i>

842
01:16:39,307 --> 01:16:43,266
<i>And now, even though it will exhaust
the final energy left within me...</i>

843
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:45,810
Father, no.

844
01:16:47,315 --> 01:16:49,783
<i>Look at me, Kal-El.</i>

845
01:16:52,521 --> 01:16:57,322
<i>The Kryptonian prophecy
will be at last fulfilled.</i>

846
01:16:57,626 --> 01:17:03,155
<i>The son becomes the father,
the father becomes the son.</i>

847
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:11,571
<i>Farewell forever, Kal-El.</i>

848
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:17,311
<i>Remember me, my son.</i>

849
01:17:47,342 --> 01:17:48,934
My son.

850
01:18:04,526 --> 01:18:06,221
Father!

851
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:23,333
Harold. Coffee, black, no sugar.

852
01:18:23,512 --> 01:18:26,606
Black, no sug... Yeah. Yeah.

853
01:18:27,483 --> 01:18:29,041
Who's paying, huh?

854
01:18:30,086 --> 01:18:32,816
No, no! There's three of them.
That cockamamie general...

855
01:18:32,989 --> 01:18:37,119
...and a big truck with hair on it and a broad
that looks like the queen of the runway.

856
01:18:37,293 --> 01:18:42,026
They can fly, they can see through things.
Anything Superman can do, they can do.

857
01:18:42,498 --> 01:18:44,796
Where is he, anyway?

858
01:18:45,001 --> 01:18:46,992
Maybe he hasn't heard
about it yet, chief.

859
01:18:47,169 --> 01:18:49,330
- Maybe...
- Maybe he's just run out of guts.

860
01:18:49,505 --> 01:18:52,133
- No sugar. And don't call me "chief."
- He'll be here.

861
01:18:52,308 --> 01:18:55,835
- If there's any way at all, he'll be here.
- Yeah, he'll be here.

862
01:18:58,381 --> 01:19:00,645
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

863
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:03,250
- Hey, Charlie, you feel that?
- Yeah.

864
01:19:03,552 --> 01:19:04,951
Sounds like an earthquake.

865
01:19:07,056 --> 01:19:08,614
Oh, my!

866
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:17,392
- It's those three.
- Stop!

867
01:19:17,566 --> 01:19:20,865
- Oh, my God, they're here now!
- Oh, no!

868
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:33,676
This is scary!

869
01:20:22,765 --> 01:20:24,892
You all right, chief?

870
01:20:25,401 --> 01:20:26,800
Hi.

871
01:20:28,738 --> 01:20:31,639
You should see the White House.
They'll be cleaning for months.

872
01:20:31,807 --> 01:20:33,138
Lex Luthor.

873
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:34,937
Wouldn't you know it?

874
01:20:35,578 --> 01:20:38,411
This is the son of Jor-El?

875
01:20:38,581 --> 01:20:40,481
- No, but I bet you're a son of a...
- Jimmy!

876
01:20:41,717 --> 01:20:44,709
You promised me the son of Jor-El.

877
01:20:46,188 --> 01:20:47,348
Yes, Your Grace.

878
01:20:47,957 --> 01:20:51,552
But what I've given
you is the next best thing.

879
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:54,753
You just hold on to that
little lady, and he'll be along.

880
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,488
See, they have this relationship.

881
01:20:56,665 --> 01:21:00,999
She does all his public relations,
and he gives her every exclusive.

882
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:03,832
They're the best of friends.
You know what I mean?

883
01:21:04,173 --> 01:21:07,404
What an undemanding
male this Superman must be.

884
01:21:07,843 --> 01:21:10,471
You could use a tuck
here and there yourself, sister.

885
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,572
Wait!

886
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:14,113
- I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

887
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:17,416
Kill the rest, starting with him.

888
01:21:19,955 --> 01:21:22,446
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

889
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:24,183
Wait. Wait.

890
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:28,456
Don't you remember the White House?
The Oval Room? We had a few laughs there.

891
01:21:29,031 --> 01:21:30,590
You ought to have that fixed.

892
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:43,373
General...

893
01:21:44,281 --> 01:21:46,408
...haven't you heard
of freedom of the press?

894
01:21:46,616 --> 01:21:48,641
- Superman!
- Superman, thank God.

895
01:21:49,619 --> 01:21:50,984
I mean, get him!

896
01:21:51,388 --> 01:21:53,219
Come to me, son of Jor-El!

897
01:21:53,723 --> 01:21:56,556
Kneel before Zod!

898
01:22:11,174 --> 01:22:13,165
Watch out. You all right?

899
01:22:32,762 --> 01:22:34,320
Son of Jor-El.

900
01:22:34,798 --> 01:22:37,358
We were beginning to
think you were a coward.

901
01:22:37,734 --> 01:22:38,996
I'm not a coward, Zod.

902
01:22:39,269 --> 01:22:42,329
It is extremely likely
you are merely a fool.

903
01:22:42,506 --> 01:22:44,872
Like father, like son.

904
01:23:01,157 --> 01:23:02,556
Look out!

905
01:23:05,629 --> 01:23:08,393
Then die as you deserve to!

906
01:23:18,542 --> 01:23:20,737
Come on, come on, Superman! Get him!

907
01:23:21,011 --> 01:23:23,070
Man, this is gonna be good.

908
01:23:59,082 --> 01:24:00,674
<i>Superman.</i>

909
01:24:21,705 --> 01:24:24,071
- Hey, that's the chief's.
- The chief's got it.

910
01:24:32,782 --> 01:24:34,750
What, you hit a woman?

911
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:01,038
Oh, my God! My baby!

912
01:25:01,412 --> 01:25:03,846
Help my baby!

913
01:25:06,717 --> 01:25:08,412
Thank you.

914
01:25:09,987 --> 01:25:13,548
This Superman is nothing of the kind.

915
01:25:13,758 --> 01:25:16,158
- I've discovered his weakness.
- Yes.

916
01:25:16,327 --> 01:25:17,726
He cares.

917
01:25:17,995 --> 01:25:21,260
He actually cares
for these Earth people.

918
01:25:21,432 --> 01:25:24,595
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

919
01:25:32,777 --> 01:25:34,677
I'll draw his fire...

920
01:25:34,845 --> 01:25:36,779
...with some of my own.

921
01:26:04,341 --> 01:26:06,002
What's happening to those cars?

922
01:26:09,447 --> 01:26:10,914
Get out of the way!

923
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:27,182
Superman.

924
01:28:12,737 --> 01:28:14,136
Oh, thank you!

925
01:28:14,306 --> 01:28:16,866
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

926
01:28:31,089 --> 01:28:33,182
No! Don't do it!

927
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:35,286
The people!

928
01:28:39,931 --> 01:28:41,728
Throw it!

929
01:29:02,954 --> 01:29:06,253
- Get away from there. Get away from there.
- Let's help them out!

930
01:29:09,794 --> 01:29:13,252
- I got her. I got her. Don't worry.
- He's dead.

931
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:16,891
Superman is dead.

932
01:29:20,138 --> 01:29:21,400
They've killed Superman.

933
01:29:22,841 --> 01:29:25,139
- He's dead.
- Let's go get them!

934
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:27,904
- Come on, we'll show them!
- I know some judo. Let's go!

935
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:29,970
Come on!

936
01:30:00,412 --> 01:30:03,040
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!

937
01:30:03,214 --> 01:30:05,614
What can you do if
you can't see what's happening?

938
01:30:10,588 --> 01:30:13,716
- Hold on!
- Oh, my God!

939
01:31:22,628 --> 01:31:25,096
You can't leave us!

940
01:31:29,802 --> 01:31:34,102
So he is a coward after all.

941
01:31:34,507 --> 01:31:36,031
He's gone.

942
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:37,732
Come back, Superman!

943
01:31:42,815 --> 01:31:44,476
Don't leave us!

944
01:31:47,386 --> 01:31:49,377
He chickened out.

945
01:31:49,889 --> 01:31:50,947
Phony!

946
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:54,225
Superman didn't even do nothing.

947
01:31:54,493 --> 01:31:56,620
Come on, let's go.

948
01:32:03,636 --> 01:32:07,436
- There they are.
- Get away from here. Jimmy.

949
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:18,280
Our victory is complete.

950
01:32:18,451 --> 01:32:20,214
The son of Jor-El has fled.

951
01:32:20,386 --> 01:32:23,082
- Superman fled?
- I don't believe you.

952
01:32:23,255 --> 01:32:27,316
You heard him. Three against one,
you should've taken two ears and a tail.

953
01:32:27,493 --> 01:32:30,587
- He fled in fear of us.
- He'll be back.

954
01:32:30,763 --> 01:32:33,129
As long as he's alive,
he's gonna try again.

955
01:32:33,299 --> 01:32:36,735
- The next time, we will kill him.
- The next time?

956
01:32:37,770 --> 01:32:39,829
The next time?

957
01:32:40,573 --> 01:32:42,666
What am I gonna do with you people?

958
01:32:42,842 --> 01:32:45,436
I held up my end.
I delivered you the blue boy.

959
01:32:45,611 --> 01:32:47,909
What do I get from my triple threat?

960
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:52,414
"Bow, yield, kneel."
That kind of stuff closes out a town.

961
01:32:53,986 --> 01:32:57,786
Why do you say this to me
when you know I will kill you for it?

962
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:01,790
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

963
01:33:02,228 --> 01:33:04,992
Extinguish the greatest
criminal flame of our age?

964
01:33:05,164 --> 01:33:09,294
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Let me kill him!

965
01:33:09,768 --> 01:33:11,360
Superman's address?

966
01:33:15,241 --> 01:33:20,577
What more do you want?
I can see the greed written on your face.

967
01:33:20,746 --> 01:33:23,613
A small incentive, O Fullest One.

968
01:33:23,782 --> 01:33:26,808
A mere bauble to jog the memory.

969
01:33:27,419 --> 01:33:28,613
What more?

970
01:33:29,588 --> 01:33:30,782
Cuba.

971
01:33:38,797 --> 01:33:45,032
I trust you are not wasting my time,
Lex Luthor.

972
01:33:45,237 --> 01:33:47,467
Of course not, Your Turbulence.

973
01:34:33,653 --> 01:34:35,746
Show yourself, coward!

974
01:34:38,658 --> 01:34:40,853
Son of a coward!

975
01:34:47,234 --> 01:34:48,531
I'm here, Zod.

976
01:34:48,935 --> 01:34:51,961
- Let Miss Lane go, step inside. We'll talk.
- No, don't, Superman!

977
01:34:52,138 --> 01:34:54,106
Please don't listen to him. He's just...

978
01:34:54,541 --> 01:34:55,803
Stop.

979
01:34:55,976 --> 01:34:57,967
Your powers are identical to mine.

980
01:34:58,144 --> 01:35:01,375
But we are three.
We could tear you limb from limb.

981
01:35:01,681 --> 01:35:02,909
Do it, Your Grace.

982
01:35:03,283 --> 01:35:05,444
Just grab a leg and just make a wish.

983
01:35:06,953 --> 01:35:09,353
But you are victim
to another fatal weakness...

984
01:35:09,789 --> 01:35:11,222
...your compassion.

985
01:35:11,391 --> 01:35:13,859
The death of others
means more to you than your own.

986
01:35:14,027 --> 01:35:15,494
Yes, with rare exceptions.

987
01:35:15,929 --> 01:35:21,458
Your father condemned us to an eternal
living death. Your fate will be the same.

988
01:35:21,735 --> 01:35:23,794
You will live, Kal-El, forever...

989
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:28,964
...as my slave. If not, then others
will pay for your obstinate attitude.

990
01:35:29,142 --> 01:35:34,671
Innocent people, millions if necessary,
beginning with this Lois person.

991
01:35:34,848 --> 01:35:36,475
- Don't, Superman, don't!
- Stop it!

992
01:35:40,687 --> 01:35:42,917
All right, Zod.

993
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:45,023
It's over.

994
01:35:47,861 --> 01:35:51,627
Your Grace, don't believe him!
You don't know him the way that I do.

995
01:35:53,833 --> 01:35:56,028
I sense the presence of Jor-El here.

996
01:35:58,038 --> 01:35:59,903
We will destroy this place.

997
01:36:00,407 --> 01:36:01,806
And then kill him.

998
01:36:04,110 --> 01:36:05,975
Him.

999
01:36:07,147 --> 01:36:10,082
Him? Me?

1000
01:36:11,484 --> 01:36:13,418
General, this is Lex Luthor.

1001
01:36:14,087 --> 01:36:17,648
Remember...?
I helped you through the tough times.

1002
01:36:17,824 --> 01:36:19,689
I filled your inside straight.

1003
01:36:20,226 --> 01:36:24,287
You came to me with nothing.
I gave you Superman.

1004
01:36:24,464 --> 01:36:25,931
Silence!

1005
01:36:26,099 --> 01:36:27,691
Well, look...

1006
01:36:30,203 --> 01:36:31,727
Guy's a clod.

1007
01:36:32,339 --> 01:36:34,398
You think you know people, right?

1008
01:36:35,008 --> 01:36:38,136
Promises were made,
gifts were exchanged.

1009
01:36:38,311 --> 01:36:41,712
I gotta hand it to you, you know.
You always told the truth.

1010
01:36:41,915 --> 01:36:44,713
A guy always knew
where he stood with you.

1011
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:49,687
Try to get them all
into this molecule chamber here.

1012
01:36:49,856 --> 01:36:51,983
It takes away their powers, see...

1013
01:36:52,158 --> 01:36:54,752
...and turns them into
ordinary human beings.

1014
01:36:54,928 --> 01:36:56,122
Now, if you could...

1015
01:36:59,299 --> 01:37:02,496
- Don't go in there. It's a trap.
- Luthor, you poisonous snake!

1016
01:37:02,869 --> 01:37:04,359
That's a molecule chamber.

1017
01:37:04,571 --> 01:37:08,405
It makes people like
you into people like me.

1018
01:37:08,842 --> 01:37:11,037
- You've done well, Lex Luthor.
- I thought so.

1019
01:37:12,245 --> 01:37:13,837
Seize him.

1020
01:37:15,515 --> 01:37:17,642
- Kill her.
- No! Superman, no!

1021
01:37:17,817 --> 01:37:19,944
All right! All right, leave her alone, Zod!

1022
01:37:20,487 --> 01:37:22,148
You win.

1023
01:37:25,358 --> 01:37:29,920
General, the crystal there
activates the mechanism.

1024
01:37:30,096 --> 01:37:32,929
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia...

1025
01:37:33,099 --> 01:37:34,794
...activate the machine.

1026
01:37:45,979 --> 01:37:47,970
With your permission.

1027
01:39:01,121 --> 01:39:03,988
And now, finally...

1028
01:39:08,229 --> 01:39:09,856
Kneel.

1029
01:39:14,368 --> 01:39:16,768
Take my hand...

1030
01:39:16,971 --> 01:39:22,739
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

1031
01:40:02,816 --> 01:40:04,181
He switched it.

1032
01:40:04,818 --> 01:40:06,752
He did it to them.

1033
01:40:07,488 --> 01:40:12,892
The lights were on out here
while he was safe in there.

1034
01:40:14,261 --> 01:40:16,252
Hey, you know something?

1035
01:40:16,597 --> 01:40:18,724
You're a real pain in the neck!

1036
01:40:28,676 --> 01:40:30,473
Are you all right?

1037
01:40:31,645 --> 01:40:35,376
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor.
A lying weasel like you couldn't resist.

1038
01:40:35,849 --> 01:40:37,714
Who, me? Are you kidding?

1039
01:40:37,885 --> 01:40:41,946
Hey, I was with you all the
time. That was beautiful.

1040
01:40:42,122 --> 01:40:44,283
Did you see the way
they fell into our trap?

1041
01:40:44,525 --> 01:40:46,959
Too late, Luthor. Too late.

1042
01:40:47,227 --> 01:40:50,424
Look. Look, Superman.

1043
01:40:50,864 --> 01:40:52,832
I got a proposition for you.

1044
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,332
Now, don't stop me
till you've heard this...

1045
01:40:55,502 --> 01:40:58,767
...because I know I owe you one,
but we're in the North Pole, right?

1046
01:42:15,984 --> 01:42:17,542
Look, Lois...

1047
01:42:18,687 --> 01:42:20,985
No regrets, okay? I did it.

1048
01:42:21,156 --> 01:42:23,750
I got the man I loved to love me.

1049
01:42:26,661 --> 01:42:30,324
- Didn't I?
- Oh, yeah.

1050
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:35,230
Well, okay then. Those people need you.

1051
01:42:35,403 --> 01:42:37,803
Do you think I don't understand that?

1052
01:42:42,277 --> 01:42:46,680
We can still see each other, you know.
I mean, all the time.

1053
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:51,314
But it just can't be...

1054
01:43:13,775 --> 01:43:16,005
Just don't forget, that's all.

1055
01:43:16,845 --> 01:43:18,210
Don't ever forget.

1056
01:43:42,704 --> 01:43:45,867
- Well, here we are.
- Home sweet home.

1057
01:43:47,075 --> 01:43:50,533
- See you at work in the morning.
- Bright and early, huh?

1058
01:43:50,712 --> 01:43:54,614
- The same old Clark and the same old Lois.
- Yup.

1059
01:43:55,416 --> 01:44:00,444
Except... maybe I won't be
quite so mean to you from now on.

1060
01:44:08,129 --> 01:44:09,391
You don't have to worry.

1061
01:44:09,964 --> 01:44:11,556
Your secret's safe with me.

1062
01:44:12,834 --> 01:44:16,395
I know. I know that, Lois.

1063
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:44,030
Well, there he goes, kid.

1064
01:44:44,967 --> 01:44:46,935
Up, up and away.

1065
01:46:12,388 --> 01:46:15,186
- No!
- No!

1066
01:46:42,551 --> 01:46:44,678
- Hey, is Mr. White free?
- On the telephone.

1067
01:46:44,853 --> 01:46:48,789
- He's in conference at the moment.
- Yeah, that's what he says.

1068
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:07,335
All right, give me three carbons of that.

1069
01:47:07,509 --> 01:47:09,841
- Hi.
- It's gonna be an insert in the paper.

1070
01:47:10,012 --> 01:47:11,741
That's what they said.

1071
01:47:13,282 --> 01:47:15,750
Good morning. Hi.

1072
01:47:21,423 --> 01:47:23,050
Good morning, Lois.

1073
01:47:28,764 --> 01:47:30,595
- Good morning, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

1074
01:47:30,766 --> 01:47:33,496
Jeepers, I have seen
some faraway looks in my time...

1075
01:47:33,669 --> 01:47:36,901
...but with that look, you might as well
be on the North Pole.

1076
01:47:37,874 --> 01:47:40,069
The North Pole.

1077
01:47:41,277 --> 01:47:42,869
No, that's too silly.

1078
01:47:43,847 --> 01:47:49,444
Did you ever feel like you knew something
that was so important that...

1079
01:47:49,786 --> 01:47:51,617
No, you never did.

1080
01:47:52,422 --> 01:47:58,122
I mean, I feel like I'm sitting on the single
most important story of my career...

1081
01:47:58,294 --> 01:48:00,387
...and I can't remember what it is.

1082
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:04,525
Well, knowing you,
it must have been about Superman.

1083
01:48:04,701 --> 01:48:07,966
Maybe how he saved the city or
saved the world or saved the universe.

1084
01:48:08,138 --> 01:48:12,074
Clark, Clark. Listen.
Jealousy's really counterproductive.

1085
01:48:12,242 --> 01:48:14,938
Now, there's some things
that you can do too.

1086
01:48:15,945 --> 01:48:17,537
Oh, yeah?

1087
01:48:17,714 --> 01:48:20,478
Really? Like what?

1088
01:48:21,985 --> 01:48:23,179
Get us a pizza.

1089
01:48:23,953 --> 01:48:27,684
- A pizza. Now?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

1090
01:48:28,158 --> 01:48:30,683
Actually, I don't think
Mr. White would like it if...

1091
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:32,794
I'll pay for half of it, all right?

1092
01:48:32,962 --> 01:48:34,395
I'm going.

1093
01:48:39,569 --> 01:48:41,002
Lois?

1094
01:48:41,471 --> 01:48:42,768
You know, about the pizza?

1095
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:47,476
It's okay. I'll pay for the whole thing.

1096
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:51,670
You know, you're really super.

1097
01:49:13,369 --> 01:49:15,769
- Hey, Ron.
- Yeah?

1098
01:49:15,939 --> 01:49:17,736
Give me another
plate of this garbage.

1099
01:49:17,907 --> 01:49:20,671
Garbage? That's my
number-one special, Rocky.

1100
01:49:20,877 --> 01:49:24,506
All right. Get me some
more coffee too, will you?

1101
01:49:25,815 --> 01:49:30,149
Gee, that's funny. I've never
seen garbage eat garbage before.

1102
01:49:38,194 --> 01:49:42,096
Excuse me, sir. I think
you're sitting in my favorite seat.

1103
01:49:42,265 --> 01:49:43,596
Come and get it, four-eyes.

1104
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:50,001
Now cool it, Rocky.

1105
01:49:51,174 --> 01:49:52,300
Take it easy, will you?

1106
01:49:52,475 --> 01:49:55,911
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

1107
01:50:12,529 --> 01:50:14,622
Oh, God!

1108
01:50:26,342 --> 01:50:28,469
This order's to go.

1109
01:50:36,219 --> 01:50:40,087
I'm terribly sorry
about all the damage, sir.

1110
01:50:42,458 --> 01:50:46,360
I've been working out.
