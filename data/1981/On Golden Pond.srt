1
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,820
Norman, come here. Come here.

2
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,365
Norman.

3
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,580
Hurry up.

4
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,900
The loons. The loons.

5
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,809
They're welcoming us back.

6
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,403
I don't hear a thing.

7
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,620
Just look at this place.

8
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,300
- It's a mess, isn't it?
- Just take a second.

9
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,180
It'll be all shipshape again

10
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,850
and warmer.

11
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,580
Phone works!

12
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,126
At least I think it does.

13
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,940
Hello.

14
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,806
Hello!

15
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,140
Who the hell is that?

16
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,100
Who the hell's in this picture here?

17
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,420
Who the hell is that?

18
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,900
Hello.
Who's this?

19
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,540
The operator?

20
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,900
What do you want?

21
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,300
You called.
You must want something.

22
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,980
Oh, wait a minute.

23
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,380
I did call you, but you never answered.

24
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,300
Well, how are you?

25
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,140
How nice.

26
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,500
Listen, this is Norman Thayer, Jr.
over on Golden Pond.

27
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,100
I have something I want you to do.

28
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,380
Call me up.
Can you do that?

29
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,340
I want to check my phone,
see if it still rings.

30
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,220
Hasn't rung all winter.
May have lost its whatsie.

31
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,100
You have my number?

32
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,940
I have no idea.

33
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,980
It's got a nine, that's all I know.

34
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,606
It's in the book!
You must have a book.

35
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,540
Norman Thayer, Jr.

36
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,642
Let's give her a try, shall we?

37
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,123
Who the hell is that?

38
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,500
Someone's at the door.

39
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,285
It's me, you old poop!

40
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,083
Well, look at you.

41
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,180
Look at me?

42
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,500
Quite a sight, aren't I?

43
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,300
Oh, Norman, it's so beautiful.

44
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,100
Everything's just waking up.

45
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,220
Little tiny birds, little tiny leaves.

46
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,540
I saw a patch of little tiny flowers

47
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,900
over by the old cellar hall.

48
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,700
I forget what they're called.

49
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,900
Little, tiny yellow things.

50
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,780
Well... want to help me
with the dust covers?

51
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,020
I don't have anything else to do.

52
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,610
Come on.

53
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,820
What were you doing out in the woods?

54
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,300
Norman, what do you think I was doing?

55
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,580
I was getting wood.

56
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,260
Hey, I met the nicest couple.

57
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,380
- Huh? Where?
- In the woods.

58
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,580
Couple of people?

59
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,540
No, a couple of antelope.

60
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,500
Of course, a couple of people.

61
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,740
The name is Migliori, I believe.

62
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,740
Migliori?
What sort of name is that?

63
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,140
I don't know, darling.
Italian, I suppose.

64
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,780
- They're up from Boston.
- They speak English?

65
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,780
Well, of course they speak English.

66
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,660
They're a nice, middle-aged couple,
just like us.

67
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,620
If they're just like us,
they're not middle-aged.

68
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,860
Of course they are.

69
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,380
Middle-aged means the middle, Ethel.

70
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,420
Middle of life.
People don't live to be 150!

71
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,580
Well, we're at the far edge
of middle age, that's all.

72
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,140
We're not, you know.

73
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,140
We're not middle-aged.
You're old and I'm ancient.

74
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,580
Oh, pooh!

75
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,180
You're in your 70s and I'm in my 60s.

76
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,940
Just barely, on both counts.

77
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,060
Would you like to spend
the rest of the afternoon

78
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,780
quibbling about this?

79
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,060
We can if you like.

80
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,980
For the Lord's sake.

81
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,580
The Miglioris, whatever their age group,

82
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,420
have invited us to have dinner sometime.

83
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,700
Wouldn't that be nice?

84
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,740
No, I'm not sure my stomach's
ready for rigatoni.

85
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,420
- That sort of thing.
- Oh, no!

86
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,340
Poor Elmer!

87
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,380
He's had a terrible fall.

88
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,900
Poor little Elmer, the life you've led.

89
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,340
He was my first true love, you know.

90
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,500
Known all along
I wasn't the first in line.

91
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,980
No, you were a rather cheap
substitute for Elmer.

92
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,020
And now he's had a fall.

93
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,060
Maybe he wanted to kill himself.
Maybe he wanted to be cremated.

94
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,100
Probably got cancer
or termites or something.

95
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,380
- Shut up, Norman.
- Not a bad way to go, huh?

96
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,860
A quick frontflip off the mantel,
a bit of a kick at the last minute,

97
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,540
end up right in the fire...
nothing to it.

98
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,060
Norman, will you shut up?

99
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,300
When my number's up,
do that for me, will ya?

100
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,420
Prop me up on the mantel
and point out which way is down.

101
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,860
Might even try for a full gainer
with a half twist.

102
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,060
Norman Thayer Jr.,
your fascination with dying

103
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,460
is beginning to frazzle my good humor.

104
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,020
Not fascination.

105
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,500
- Just crosses my mind now and then.
- Every five minutes.

106
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,460
Don't you have anything else
to think about?

107
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,900
Nothing quite as interesting.

108
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,420
Well, what's stopping you?

109
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,820
Why don't you take your dive
and get it over with?

110
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,940
And leave you alone with Elmer?

111
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,660
- You must be mad!
- Oh, for pity's sake.

112
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,048
Come on, help me
get the canoe off the porch.

113
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,340
Norman, are you paddling?

114
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,860
Of course I'm paddling.

115
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,180
Then you're not steering.

116
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,260
You want me to take the stern?

117
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,486
I most certainly do not.

118
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,340
Norman!

119
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,500
- Good God, what is it?
- Look, look!

120
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,180
Oh, look, I've spotted the loons.

121
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,820
Oh, they're so lovely!

122
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,082
Here, here.

123
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,170
Look.

124
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,487
- Can you see them?
- No.

125
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,100
Oh, my goodness!
There they are.

126
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,860
Oh, they're so beautiful.

127
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,380
Yeah, they're huge.

128
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,820
I never saw such big loons in my life.

129
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,860
Those are boats, you poop.

130
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,530
Come in closer.

131
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,765
A husband and wife.

132
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,180
I think they're looking at us.

133
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,726
Yeah, they are.

134
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,340
What the hell's the matter with them?

135
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,660
Hey, buzz off!

136
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,100
Buzz off!

137
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,020
- Ethel, what are you doing?
- What do you mean what am I doing?

138
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,780
- Don't do that.
- Why not? You did it.

139
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,484
Never mind, I'll explain later.

140
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,020
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

141
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,900
How about that?
Right on your man.

142
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,020
Where were you?

143
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,700
Where was I?

144
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,060
Oh, come off it.
Don't give me that.

145
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,260
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... damn!

146
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,900
11, yes.
Damn it.

147
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,700
Good night, sweet prince.

148
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,043
5, 10, 15, and 20.

149
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,406
Well, mother!

150
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,780
You want to stay here and watch the boat

151
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,660
while I run into the store?

152
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,740
I think I'm qualified to watch the boat.

153
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,340
Come with me if you want to.

154
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,900
- No, thank you very much.
- Okay.

155
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,860
- Hello, Sumner.
- Good morning, Mrs. Thayer.

156
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,780
- Will you fill her up, please?
- Sure.

157
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,484
Norman will help you.

158
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,420
That'll be $38, please, Mr. Thayer.

159
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,260
God...

160
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,980
you know how much gasoline cost
when I was your age?

161
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,820
12 cents a gallon.

162
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,260
Is that a fact?

163
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,249
I didn't even know
they had gas back then.

164
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,100
What are you, a couple of nitwits?

165
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,380
Think it's funny being old?

166
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,020
My whole goddamn body's falling apart.

167
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,740
Sometimes I can't even
go to the bathroom when I want to.

168
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,500
But I'm still a man, let me tell you.
And I can take on both you punks!

169
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,125
Norman!
Here we go.

170
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,164
Thanks, boys.

171
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,924
I'll drive home.

172
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,500
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

173
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,860
If I make the wrong turn
and wind up in Michigan

174
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,769
or someplace, be sure you let me know.

175
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,460
Someone's at the door.

176
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,291
It's me, you old poop!

177
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,220
- Where you been?
- Picking strawberries.

178
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,820
There were oodles and oodles
of little strawberries

179
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,500
- along the old town road.
- How nice.

180
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,460
What on earth you're doing in here

181
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,900
on a morning like this,
Norman, is beyond me.

182
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,820
I've been quite busy looking through

183
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,060
yesterday's paper
for gainful employment.

184
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,220
- Here we go again.
- Very good prospects, I think.

185
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,620
Chauffeurs, yard work.

186
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,100
Dairy Divine wants a...
ice cream dipper.

187
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,460
I think I can do something like that.

188
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,700
Don't you?
What do you think?

189
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,300
What are you gonna do
if you call and they say,

190
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,180
"Come on over and start tomorrow"?

191
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,540
I'll go on over and start tomorrow.

192
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,820
Oh, for the love of God, Norman,

193
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,700
what on earth's the matter with you?

194
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,740
Look, give me that stuff.

195
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,500
Why don't you take these buckets

196
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,540
and go pick us another quart
of strawberries?

197
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,700
And I'll fix us up a scrumptious
strawberry shortcake for lunch.

198
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,380
Go on.

199
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,300
You want me to pick strawberries?

200
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,220
Yep. Do I have to put an ad
in the paper?

201
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,660
I'm not sure I know
how to pick strawberries.

202
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,660
It's really very simple, Norman.
Bend over and pick them.

203
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,980
Bend over?

204
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,260
Where are they?

205
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,340
On the ground where they belong.

206
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,620
Last time we picked
blueberries on a bush.

207
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,180
You didn't have to bend over at all.

208
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,647
These are strawberries
and they grow on the ground.

209
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,420
Here comes whatshisname.

210
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,060
He'll have the paper, you know.

211
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,500
I don't want to miss
any career opportunities

212
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,780
off looking for strawberries.

213
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,260
I'll pay you, Norman.

214
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,180
May be the beginning of something big.

215
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,100
You may become
a major strawberry picker.

216
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,100
Not if I'm bending over all the time.
I think you're trying to kill me.

217
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,820
- I thought about it.
- Well, you needn't bother.

218
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,860
I'm living on borrowed time as it is.

219
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,900
Will you take your cheery personality
and get out of here?

220
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,820
I hope you're prepared to massage
my bent back this evening.

221
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,100
With pleasure.

222
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,444
Maybe I can lie down
to pick the berries.

223
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,820
Morning, Ethel.

224
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,380
Hi, Charlie!

225
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,020
Come on up and have some coffee.

226
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,565
You can take five minutes.

227
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,442
You got a letter from Chelsea.

228
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,860
The rest is just bills
and junk like that.

229
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,803
Sure.
Go on in.

230
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,060
I think I broke your door.

231
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,420
No, no, it's been that way
for months now.

232
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,180
Norman's supposed to fix it,
but I'm afraid it's not high

233
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,045
on his list of priorities.

234
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,220
Oh, Charl...

235
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,220
Hi, Norman.

236
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,100
Norman, are you back already?

237
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,580
You barely left.

238
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,660
So? I moved fast.

239
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,980
Ran all the way and picked
without stopping on the way back.

240
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,500
Let me see what you've got.

241
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,660
- I'll just dump 'em in with yours.
- No.

242
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,020
Not a single berry.

243
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,860
What's the matter with you?

244
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,088
I must have eaten them all.

245
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,700
No mail today, Charlie?

246
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,280
Holy mackinoly, I left it on the porch.

247
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,060
How 'bout bringing it in?
Can you do that?

248
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,003
Oh, you bet.

249
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,646
- Glass of milk, Norman?
- No.

250
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,340
I see you broke
the screen door, Charlie.

251
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,700
Well, it's just missing its little
thingamabobbers for the hinges.

252
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,620
I could bring you a couple
from town tomorrow.

253
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,500
Just be careful next time.

254
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,100
Here it is, Norman.
Drink it.

255
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,020
Thank you, nurse.

256
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,380
Finish your coffee over here.

257
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,130
There you go.

258
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,860
What you got there, Norman?

259
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,340
I have no idea.
I can't open it.

260
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,171
Here, bite this, please.

261
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,860
Oh, just his medicine.

262
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,740
Oh, goody.
What a swell surprise.

263
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,940
Nothing serious.
Just for his palpitations.

264
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,180
That's right, Charlie,
I have occasional heartthrobs.

265
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,380
Norman, we got a letter from Chelsea.

266
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,580
Look at the goddamn Orioles!

267
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,500
Baltimore's always been a sneaky town.

268
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,260
Norman.

269
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,340
She's coming for your birthday.

270
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,740
How nice.

271
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,020
Yep, and she's bringing a friend.

272
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,100
- She has the nicest boyfriend.
- Oh?

273
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,820
They're coming together and then
they're going on to Europe for a while.

274
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,500
Oh, really?

275
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,740
I don't want crowds of people
coming on my birthday.

276
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,900
I don't want crowds of people
watching me turn older.

277
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,700
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

278
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,660
It's not that Freddie person.

279
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,060
This is a different boyfriend
altogether.

280
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,620
What the hell's going on?

281
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,180
Detroit's disappeared!

282
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,700
Good God!

283
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,060
What is it, Norman?

284
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,980
Detroit's gone.

285
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,260
What happened to her husband?

286
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,180
What is it, Charlie?

287
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,660
I was wondering what happened
to Chelsea's husband.

288
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,728
It didn't work out.

289
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,882
Hey...

290
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,420
she... she says...

291
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,900
she says she's in love with a dentist.

292
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,300
Does her boyfriend know about this?

293
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,940
This is her new boyfriend.

294
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,940
Her new boyfriend is a dentist.

295
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,420
That's who she's bringing here?

296
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,340
- A dentist?
- Yeah.

297
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,900
Good God!

298
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,260
He'll be staring at our teeth
all the time.

299
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,460
Well, shall we ask him not to come?

300
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,940
No, I think we should have
representatives

301
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,060
from all walks of life
at my last birthday party.

302
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,180
Oh, lorks!

303
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,540
I think this medicine should be put away

304
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,211
from all this hot air.

305
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,100
Why didn't you marry Chelsea?

306
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,740
- You wouldn't let me.
- Oh?

307
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,500
You could've married somebody else.
I'd have allowed that.

308
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,285
- I didn't want anyone else.
- Oh?

309
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,060
How old will you be?

310
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,980
- When?
- On your birthday.

311
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,048
103.

312
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,300
Miss Appley was 97 in May.

313
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,340
- Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah.

314
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,780
- She died, you know.
- No.

315
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,660
Yeah, last Tuesday.

316
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,604
We got a call,
in case any mail comes up.

317
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,524
Gave you a forwarding address
for Miss Appley?

318
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,860
What's so funny?

319
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,780
One of the lesbians expired.

320
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,820
Oh, no.
Which one, Charlie?

321
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,684
Miss Appley.

322
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,220
Well, she had a good, full life.

323
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,900
Charlie said she was 97.

324
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,580
97!

325
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,380
Isn't that wonderful?

326
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,540
Puts us all to shame, doesn't it?

327
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,769
There's something to be said
for a deviant lifestyle.

328
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,700
Well, thanks for the coffee, Ethel.

329
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,900
You still make the best biscuits
on the lake.

330
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,500
Thank you, Charlie.

331
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,980
You must come around when Chelsea comes.

332
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,740
Hey, I haven't seen her in a long time.

333
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,220
No.

334
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,060
Well...

335
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,860
Norman.

336
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,380
Charlie's leaving.

337
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,420
Good!
Bye.

338
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,284
Good-bye.

339
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,564
Watch out for that screen door.

340
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,100
Norman!

341
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,409
The loons are teaching
their baby to fly.

342
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,940
- Isn't that exciting?
- Listen to this.

343
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,100
"Retired people sought
for handbill delivery.

344
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,460
Some walking involved."

345
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,300
I should call.
I can walk.

346
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,300
Is that why you came rushing back here,

347
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,449
to read those goddamned ads?

348
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,611
You wanna know why I came back so fast?

349
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,100
I got to the end of our lane,

350
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,044
I couldn't remember
where the old town road was.

351
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,820
I wandered away in the woods.

352
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,420
There was nothing familiar,
not one damn tree.

353
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,340
Scared me half to death.

354
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,940
That's why I came...

355
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,340
running back here to you...

356
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,660
to see your pretty face.

357
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,128
I could feel safe.
I was still me.

358
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,451
You're safe, you old poop.

359
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,691
And you're definitely still you.

360
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,043
Picking on poor old Charlie.

361
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,322
After lunch...

362
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,620
after we've gobbled up
all those silly strawberries,

363
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,660
we'll take ourselves
to the old town road.

364
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,048
We've been there
a thousand times, darling.

365
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,127
A thousand, and you'll remember it all.

366
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,928
Listen to me, mister.

367
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,460
You're my knight in shining armor.

368
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,780
Don't you forget it.

369
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,620
You're gonna get back
on that little horse,

370
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,460
and I'm gonna be right behind you,
holding on tight.

371
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,700
And away we're gonna go, go, go.

372
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,768
I don't like horses.

373
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,044
You are a pretty old dame, aren't you?

374
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,620
What are you doing with a dotty
old son of a bitch like me?

375
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,700
Well...

376
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,724
I haven't the vaguest idea.

377
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,660
I don't think you should do that
in front of Chelsea's companion.

378
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,300
Oh, pooh!

379
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,260
I was just talking to my friends.

380
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,980
Hey, look at you!

381
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,380
My, oh, my.
You have on a tie.

382
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,340
Yes, I know.
I put it there.

383
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,900
Do I look all right?

384
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,740
I haven't overdressed, have I?

385
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,420
You look sexy.

386
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,820
I'm gonna have to do
some pretty fast maneuvers

387
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,060
to catch up with you!

388
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,700
I have some other ties.

389
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,928
You could come as Miss Appley.

390
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,570
Thank you.

391
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,260
"Welcome home, Chelsea"?

392
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,540
I see my birthday party

393
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,940
wasn't cause enough for celebration.

394
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,442
I just wanted our little girl
to feel welcome, that's all.

395
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,660
Norman.

396
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,401
Wouldn't it be nice if we could
all get along this time?

397
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,300
Where the hell are they?

398
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,100
I'm getting older by the minute.

399
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,340
They said they'd be here
when they get here.

400
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,020
- Is that what they said?
- Yep.

401
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,220
That's a hell of an attitude.

402
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,020
No wonder we don't have
any grandchildren.

403
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,580
What would we do with grandchildren?

404
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,740
Toss them on our knee.

405
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,140
We're the last of the Thayers, you know.

406
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,700
End of the line for a damn good name.

407
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,691
Yep, and we're gonna
take it out in style.

408
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,180
Oh, my God!
They're here.

409
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,820
I'm not even dressed.

410
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,740
I look like an old character.

411
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,860
You are an old character.

412
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,442
Go on upstairs and change
if it'll make you feel any better.

413
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,300
- Be nice to them.
- Sure.

414
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,020
I'll explain the risks involved
in being late

415
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,020
to an old man's birthday party.

416
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,220
Anybody home?

417
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,100
Too late.

418
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,140
Look, move that flower vase
over to the other side of the table.

419
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,500
- Why?
- Just do it, Norman!

420
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,409
For once, just do it!

421
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,340
Hey! Oh, Mommy!

422
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,500
Oh, darling!
What a treat.

423
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,140
Let me look at you.
Oh, you look great.

424
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,020
- Where is he?
- Just inside the door. Go ahead.

425
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,610
He's waiting for you.

426
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,930
Hello, Norman.

427
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,380
- Well, look at you.
- Happy birthday!

428
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,660
Look at this little fat girl, Ethel.

429
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,740
Oh, Norman.

430
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,140
You're as thin as a rail.

431
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,860
- Isn't she?
- Sure.

432
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,580
Oh, my darling,
I'm so glad you're home.

433
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,220
- Here, give me all those.
- I didn't think we were gonna make it.

434
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,660
We rented a car that explodes
every 40 miles.

435
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,780
- Rented a car?
- In Boston.

436
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,580
What sort of car is it?

437
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,740
I don't know.
Green, I think.

438
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,580
Ooh, a green car.

439
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,980
I meant what sort of make is it?

440
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,020
I don't know.

441
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,500
She doesn't know, Norman.
It doesn't matter.

442
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,860
Of course it doesn't matter.
I was just curious.

443
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,780
Well, I guess I should have looked.

444
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,020
Let's see... it's very ugly
and it breaks down a lot.

445
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,540
Ugly and breaks down?

446
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,740
Sounds like a Nash.

447
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,540
Yes, well...

448
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,820
Where... where's your friend?

449
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,860
You did bring your friend, didn't you?

450
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,220
I knew there was something
I was forgetting.

451
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,780
That's still on, huh?

452
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,500
Well, as far as I know.

453
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,820
Come on in.

454
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,660
No one's gonna bite you.
Come on.

455
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,888
Mommy, Norman, this is Billy Ray.

456
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,529
How you doing?

457
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,420
You seem awfully young to be a dentist.

458
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,204
This is Billy Ray, Jr.

459
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,300
I'm Norman Thayer, Jr.
Worse.

460
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,020
His father is trying to park the car.

461
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,020
Well, this is a great surprise.

462
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,780
You can call me Ethel, Billy.

463
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,620
And you can call Norman Norman.

464
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,420
I like your logic, Mommy.

465
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,260
I'm gonna go see if Bill
has driven into the lake.

466
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,362
Put away some of these things.

467
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,940
I hear you turned 80 today.

468
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,460
That what you heard?

469
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,540
Yeah.

470
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,460
Man, that's really old.

471
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,980
You should meet my father.

472
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,740
Your father's still alive?

473
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,500
No, but you should meet him.

474
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,540
Isn't this fun?

475
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,100
Norman, why don't we put Billy
in Chelsea's old room?

476
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,340
Then he can look out at the lake
in the morning.

477
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,860
Why don't we put him out on the float?

478
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,580
He can look at the lake all night long.

479
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,460
I'd like that.

480
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,740
I'm afraid you'd be eaten alive
by all the bugs.

481
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,980
- So?
- Norman, take him up.

482
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,700
Show him where everything is.

483
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,370
Come on, boy.

484
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,460
I just had a birthday too.
I turned 13 two weeks ago.

485
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,040
Oh? We're practically twins.

486
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,140
- I'm so glad you're here.
- He'll be right in.

487
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,340
He actually thinks
you have to lock your car.

488
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,140
Mommy...

489
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,940
Norman looks so old.

490
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,247
Oh, I don't know.

491
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,340
You look great, though.

492
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,100
Thank you.
So do you.

493
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,820
I love your hair.

494
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,060
Thanks.
How's his mind?

495
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,740
Is he remembering things better?

496
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,340
- Is he...
- He's all right.

497
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,460
He's all right.

498
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,020
Come on, Billy.

499
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,603
I'll show you the bathroom,
if I can remember where it is.

500
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,620
Well, at least he hasn't changed.

501
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,020
Nope, he's still impossible.

502
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,420
It means so much to him
to have you here.

503
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,940
Sure, now he's got
someone he can pick on.

504
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,300
Oh, come on.
Thank you for coming.

505
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,900
Thank you for inviting me.

506
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,525
Chels.

507
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,660
Well, you finally made it.

508
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,820
This is my mother.

509
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,140
- Hi.
- Mommy, this is Bill Ray.

510
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,300
- I think I saw a bear.
- Oh, no.

511
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,980
You couldn't have seen a bear out there
at this time of year.

512
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,380
There are some rather nasty moths
flying around, though.

513
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,300
No, no, this was a little big
for a moth.

514
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,460
If you really wanna be scared,
wait till you meet my father.

515
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,460
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey, Billy!

516
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,140
Dad, they do have indoor plumbing here.

517
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,620
Oh, great!

518
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,740
Chelsea was just bullshitting us.

519
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,820
I like to paint a rather rustic picture
of life on Golden Pond.

520
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,020
It's rustic, all right!

521
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,780
It's lovely, though.
It's lovely rusticity.

522
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,123
We've been peeing indoors for 40 years.

523
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,220
Well, you must be Norman.

524
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,100
Must be.
Who are you?

525
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,140
- Bill Ray.
- Bill Ray.

526
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,540
- The dentist?
- Yes, sir.

527
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,369
Want to see my teeth?

528
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,740
I'd just like to tell you, sir,
how glad we are to be here.

529
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,580
Chelsea has told me so much about you

530
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,380
and your lovely wife,
your wonderful place here on the lake.

531
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,220
We're very pleased
she's brought us here.

532
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,180
I'm frankly surprised
Chelsea could find the way.

533
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,940
Well, she's here, Norman,
and that's what's important.

534
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,700
Do you visit your parents, young man?

535
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,420
No, sir.
My parents both passed away.

536
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,180
I see. Then you have
a good excuse, don't you?

537
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,660
Norman, please.

538
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,460
Norman, why...

539
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,300
What? Am I not allowed
to speak to our guests?

540
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,940
Is that it?

541
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,122
They're afraid I'm gonna embarrass them.

542
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,140
Well, I'm going to go
say hello to the lake.

543
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,540
- Anybody coming?
- Me.

544
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,340
I've never seen anyone
say hello to a lake before.

545
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,140
Mommy, are you coming?

546
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,380
Yeah.
Want to take the boat?

547
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,220
A boat?
All right!

548
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,367
Bill, aren't you coming?

549
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,340
Where, outside?

550
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,620
Well, that's where the lake is.

551
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,740
Coming, Norman?

552
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,020
No, I think I'll just sit here
and enjoy the quiet.

553
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,660
I'll stay, too.

554
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,921
With Bill.

555
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,820
The screen door is broken.

556
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,163
Really?
Norman will fix it.

557
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,020
I love your house.

558
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,168
Thank you.
It's not for sale.

559
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,300
I don't want to buy it, I just like it.

560
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,260
It has a...

561
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,124
charming ambiance.

562
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,020
Well, how does it feel to turn 80?

563
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,980
Twice as bad as it did turning 40.

564
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,780
I know what that's like.

565
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,009
I turned 405 years ago.

566
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,524
I'm 45 now.

567
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,060
Norman...

568
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,900
Do you mind if I call you Norman?

569
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,860
I believe you just did.

570
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,724
I don't want to press.

571
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,780
What should I call your wife?

572
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,420
How about Ethel?

573
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,580
That's her name.
Ethel Thayer.

574
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,780
Thounds like I'm lithping, doesn't it?

575
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,220
Ethel Thayer.

576
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,380
- Almost kept her from marrying me.
- Yeah?

577
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,460
Wanted me to change
my last name to hers.

578
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,847
- And what was that?
- I don't remember.

579
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,730
Well...

580
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,780
I think I'll...

581
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,420
start a new book.

582
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,940
See if I can finish it
before I'm finished myself.

583
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,580
Maybe a novelette.

584
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,980
Maybe something from
Reader's Digest abridged.

585
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,500
Treasure island.

586
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,820
Ever read this book?

587
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,420
Oh, yeah.
That's a great book.

588
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,020
I'd highly recommend that one.

589
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,140
No need for that.
I've read it myself.

590
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,220
But my mind is going, so...

591
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,288
it'll all be new to me.

592
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,860
That son of yours ever read this book?

593
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,820
I don't think so.

594
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,020
Your son hasn't read Treasure island?

595
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,620
No, but I intend to have him read it.

596
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,700
His mother's been the real force
in his life lately,

597
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,860
but I intend to eradicate...

598
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,260
some of the...

599
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,805
dishevelment.

600
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,163
Actually...

601
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,580
actually, things are...

602
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,740
coming together
very nicely for me lately.

603
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,128
I'm beginning to feel
very good about myself.

604
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,940
Meeting...

605
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,247
meeting Chelsea was a major...

606
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,164
thing.

607
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,700
We have a...

608
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,660
we have a very kinetic relationship.

609
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,580
It's very positive.

610
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,340
I'm sure you'd be pleased.

611
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,980
What do you charge for a filling?

612
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,300
You're a dentist, aren't you?

613
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,540
What do you charge for a filling?

614
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,700
Oh, it's generally $40.

615
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,168
$40! Good God!

616
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,370
Norman...

617
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,140
we'd like to sleep together,

618
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,980
if it's all right with you.

619
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,220
What do you mean?

620
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,140
We'd... we'd like to sleep together

621
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,060
in the same room...

622
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,180
the same bed...

623
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,220
if it's not offensive to you.

624
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,380
All three of you?

625
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,260
No, just two.

626
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,460
You and Billy?

627
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,340
No.

628
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,140
Not Chelsea and Billy.

629
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,300
No.

630
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,100
That leaves Chelsea and you, then.

631
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,060
That's right.

632
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,540
Why would I find that offensive?

633
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,460
You're not planning on doing
something unusual, are you?

634
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,420
No, no, no.
Just...

635
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,500
you know, just...

636
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,940
that doesn't seem too offensive,

637
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,180
as long as you're quiet.

638
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,820
Thank you.

639
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,300
Chelsea always slept in the same bed
with her husband.

640
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,460
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Ethel and I do, you know?

641
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,260
We sleep together.
Been doing it for years.

642
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,340
I guess I'd be delighted to have you

643
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,900
abuse my daughter under my own roof.

644
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,460
Would you like the room
where I first violated her mother?

645
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,020
Or would you be interested
in the master bedroom?

646
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,100
Ethel, your boy and I
could sleep out back.

647
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,580
You could do it right here
in the hearth.

648
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,569
Like that idea?

649
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,900
You're having a good time, aren't you?

650
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,860
Chelsea told me all about
how you like to have

651
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,860
a good ol' time with people's heads.

652
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,900
She does, too, sometimes.

653
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,300
Sometimes I can get into it,
and sometimes not.

654
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,540
I think you should know I'm pretty good

655
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,860
at recognizing crap when I hear it.

656
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,460
You know, it's not imperative
that you and I become friends.

657
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,050
I thought it would be nice.

658
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,540
I'm sure you're
a very fascinating person.

659
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,100
And I thought it would be fascinating
getting to know you,

660
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,965
but it's obviously not an easy task.

661
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,725
No.

662
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,980
Just go ahead and be...

663
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,500
as "poopy" as you want,
to quote Chelsea.

664
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,420
And I'll be as receptive
and as pleasant as I can be.

665
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,380
But I want you to bear one thing in mind

666
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,300
while you're jerking me around,
making me feel like an asshole.

667
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,660
I know precisely what you're up to.

668
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,481
And I'll take just so much of it, okay?

669
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,900
Now, what is the bottom line
on this illicit sex question?

670
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,580
Very good.

671
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,060
That was a good speech.

672
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,891
Bottom line?
You're a bottom-line man.

673
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,900
All right, here's the bottom line.

674
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,300
Okay.

675
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,820
You seem like a nice man.

676
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,180
- A bit verbose, but nice.
- Thank you.

677
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,700
And you're right about me.

678
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,820
- I am fascinating.
- I'm sure you are.

679
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,380
Let's get back to talking about sex.

680
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,020
Anything you want to know, just ask me.

681
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,340
No, I just...

682
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,660
I just wanted to clear up
that little question.

683
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,180
Chelsea and I can sleep together, right?

684
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,611
Sure, please do.

685
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,004
Just don't let Ethel catch you.

686
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,540
Dad, Dad, I paddled the canoe!

687
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,900
A canoe! It's a boat!
Just like Indians had.

688
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,340
Actually, the Indians used
a different grade of aluminum.

689
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,060
Listen, Chelsea wants you
to come down to the lake.

690
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,060
She and Ethel are going skinny-dipping!

691
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,340
Skinny-dipping?

692
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,100
Go ahead, permissiveness runs rampant

693
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,820
here on Golden Pond.

694
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,490
Let's go.

695
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,500
Are there any bears around here?

696
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,260
Oh, sure.
Black bears and grizzlies.

697
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,125
One came along here last month
and ate an old lesbian.

698
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,700
Dad, come on.

699
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,780
He's just bullshitting you.

700
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,460
Come on.

701
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,100
Yeah.

702
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,180
Hey, hey, where do you think
you're going?

703
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,100
- Skinny-dipping with Chelsea.
- No, no, no.

704
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,740
You're going back inside
and talk to Mr. Thayer.

705
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,140
Bullshit!

706
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,380
Dad, I'm not going in there
with that old turkey man.

707
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,900
He gives me the creeps.

708
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,889
What if he dies?

709
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,020
Now listen to me.

710
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,500
If you don't start behaving yourself,

711
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,980
I'm gonna send you
right back to your mother.

712
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,050
Do you understand that?
Is that what you want?

713
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,580
Now go back in there and talk to him.

714
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,523
Maybe you'll learn something.

715
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,408
Go on, go on.

716
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,700
Remember when I was nine years old
and I came down

717
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,460
and caught you and Norman
skinny-dipping?

718
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,740
No, I don't remember that.

719
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,820
Don't you remember I had that big light?

720
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,940
I shined it on Norman on the
diving board and he was all naked!

721
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,580
And he screamed at me,
he called me a spy

722
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,940
and sent me to my room
for the rest of the year.

723
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,780
Oh, it took me so long to get over that.

724
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,220
It took Norman a long time

725
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,260
before he'd go skinny-dipping again.

726
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,180
He wouldn't even get out of the water

727
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,060
until I went up and made sure
that you were asleep.

728
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,300
I was so bloody mad at him
for yelling at you

729
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,500
that I let him float around down here

730
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,460
for an hour or so, freezing to death.

731
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,130
Good!

732
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,580
You going skinny-dipping?

733
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,820
Are you going skinny-dipping?

734
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,604
Nah. You?

735
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,060
Nah, I try to be selective

736
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,180
about who I flash in front of, you know?

737
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,260
Chelsea says you're
a real heavy-duty fisherman.

738
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,900
She calls you the old man of the sea.

739
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,367
I've caught a few.

740
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,380
You fish?

741
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,767
Nah.

742
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,580
What do you do out there in California?

743
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,940
I mean...

744
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,500
what does one do for recreation

745
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,888
when one is 13 and not in school?

746
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,460
We... cruise chicks.

747
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,380
Cruise chicks.
You know, meet 'em... girls.

748
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,140
Try to pick them up.

749
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,260
What do you do with them
when you have them?

750
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,140
Suck face.

751
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,500
I beg your pardon?

752
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,140
You know, kiss.

753
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,890
Suck face, you kiss.

754
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,620
Ever read this book, Treasure island?

755
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,140
No.

756
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,420
- Go read it.
- Now?

757
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,060
Come on, take it upstairs!
Read the first chapter.

758
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,322
Give me a report in the morning.

759
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,540
I thought you said we were gonna
have a party here, though.

760
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,940
I'll call you
when the party's under way,

761
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,060
if it ever is.

762
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,127
Go on!

763
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,971
Oh, I'm sorry.

764
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,820
Chelsea's still in the water.

765
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,220
You should go on down.

766
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,881
No one should skinny-dip alone.

767
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,100
Yes?

768
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,602
What... what is that over there?

769
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,686
Well, that's a lawn chair.

770
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,100
Go on.
Right down the path.

771
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,931
Right.
See you later.

772
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,020
I thought you'd be nude.

773
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,300
No, sorry.

774
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,180
I didn't want to overwhelm
our guest on his first night.

775
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,460
He's nice, isn't he?

776
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,980
- $40 a filling.
- $40!

777
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,980
That's enough to keep you off sweets.

778
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,260
He'd be a good catch, wouldn't he?

779
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,900
He said they wanted to sleep together.

780
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,140
Well, why not?
They're big people.

781
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,730
Yeah.

782
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,100
You and I did, didn't we?

783
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,740
Did we?

784
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,340
Oh, Norman...

785
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,140
have you been picking on him?

786
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,483
Yeah. He finds me fascinating.

787
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,683
Well, why not?

788
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,321
Norman...

789
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,180
Norman.

790
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,220
Chelsea... wants us

791
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,100
to do something for her.

792
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,460
She wants to leave Billy here
with us for a month.

793
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,500
- Which Billy?
- Oh, Billy, Norman!

794
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,820
The little one.

795
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,620
Bill is supposed to have him
for the summer,

796
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,740
and the kid would be
miserable in Europe.

797
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,140
Bill seems very nice,

798
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,620
and Chels needs someone nice.

799
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,620
Couldn't we do that for her?

800
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,340
What would we do with the boy?

801
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,980
What would I say to him?

802
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,100
You'd think of something.

803
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,340
Let's do it.

804
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,809
Let's say we'll do it and give Chelsea
some happiness, yes?

805
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,940
All right.

806
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,020
We'll have a splendid time,
the three of us, won't we?

807
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,060
I don't know.
We might.

808
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,220
You know, Norman...

809
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,260
you really are the sweetest man
in the world,

810
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,567
but I'm the only one who knows it.

00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,140
I suppose you expect me
to sing something now.

819
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,940
I'm not about to.

820
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,220
I've been trying all day to draw some...

821
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,780
profound conclusion
about living fourscore years.

822
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,100
Haven't thought of anything.

823
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,420
I'm surprised it got here so fast.

824
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,380
But I'm glad I got to spend so much time

825
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,860
with this beautiful woman.

826
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,060
What's your name again?

827
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,780
I want to thank all of you

828
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,300
for coming all the way here
from Disneyland

829
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,007
to witness this historic event.

830
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,860
Now that I'm out of hot air,

831
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,060
I'm gonna need a little assistance
to get these candles out.

832
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,003
Come on, everybody.

833
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,100
Come on!

834
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,565
Chicken.

835
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,927
Charlie!

836
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,060
Well, holy mackinoly!

837
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,780
Chelsea mackinelsie.

838
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,020
Charlie mackinolly.

839
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,380
Boy, it's good to see you.

840
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,380
Well, you've held up good!

841
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,980
Thanks, so have you.

842
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,380
Bill, this is my old friend Charlie.

843
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,780
He's the mailman.

844
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,220
Hi, how are you?

845
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,260
Hello.

846
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,380
Want a ride?

847
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,767
I'd love one.

848
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,300
Great.

849
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,580
You actually deliver the mail
in a boat?

850
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,180
What an incredible tradition.

851
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,460
Charlie's a legend on this lake.

852
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,700
He gets the mail through,
no matter what.

853
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,660
- Isn't that right, Charlie?
- Yeah, guess so.

854
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,220
Must be a bitch in the winter?

855
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,420
Yeah, in the winter
I have a hell of a time.

856
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,500
Of course, there's nobody
on the lake to deliver to,

857
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,807
so I get done a lot faster.

858
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,140
You've got great setup, here.

859
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,660
You're a lucky man.

860
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,649
You're a lucky man, too.

861
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,530
Yeah, I guess I am.

862
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,460
What...

863
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,820
what would you usually do
at a time like this?

864
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,340
Well, generally I just fall
into the lake.

865
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,966
Just...

866
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,060
All right, come on, Dad.

867
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,260
Big rolls here.
You can beat him.

868
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,620
- All right.
- Big rolls.

869
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,100
- All right!
- Two threes. What does that mean?

870
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,500
It means doubles, which always means
you get 14, you see?

871
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,780
You send me home,
you get 20 more, for God's sake.

872
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,220
All right, Dadder!

873
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,300
- Good, huh?
- Excellent!

874
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,780
You're a natural.

875
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,300
Starting to regret
teaching you this game.

876
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,060
Chels. Hey, Chels,
Parcheesi pro.

877
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,500
Chelsea doesn't like playing games.

878
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,900
We don't know why.
Probably doesn't like losing.

879
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,620
I tend to panic when the competition
gets too intense.

880
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,100
What's that supposed mean?

881
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,340
Nothing.

882
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,220
We play serious Parcheesi around here.

883
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,220
I let Norman win every week or so,

884
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,540
just to keep his spirits up.

885
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,100
What I'd like to know
is why you enjoy playing games.

886
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,020
You seem to like beating people.

887
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,565
I wonder why?

888
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,841
You get another chance, Bill.
Another roll of the dice.

889
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,490
Well, here's my little early bird.

890
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,820
Are you having fun?

891
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,260
That's why you come to camp, you know.

892
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,885
To have fun.

893
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,860
What's the matter, darling?

894
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,325
Nothing.

895
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,082
I don't think I've ever grown up
on Golden Pond.

896
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,860
Do you understand?

897
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,020
No. No, I don't think I understand.

898
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,043
It doesn't matter.

899
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,020
I act like a big person everywhere else.

900
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,100
I'm in charge of Los Angeles
and I come here,

901
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,567
I feel like a little fat girl.

902
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,680
That's just because
your father said that.

903
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,900
My father is a goddamn bastard.

904
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,780
Come on, Chels.

905
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,980
- Watch your language.
- Poop.

906
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,300
Why, you going to wash
my mouth out with soap?

907
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,767
That was rather a bizarre custom.

908
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,540
Mother, do you know...

909
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,820
I've been answering
to Norman all my life.

910
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,140
Makes me so mad.

911
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,580
Even when I'm 3,000 miles away
and I don't even see him,

912
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,365
I'm still answering to him.

913
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,020
Norman is a goddamn poop.

914
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,660
Oh, for the Lord's sake,
here we go again.

915
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,620
You had a miserable childhood.

916
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,380
Your father was overbearing,
your mother ignored you.

917
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,130
What else is new?

918
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,683
Chelsea...

919
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,060
you have a great big chip
on your shoulder,

920
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,243
which is very unattractive.

921
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,380
It is. It is.

922
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,540
You stay away for years at a time.

923
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,500
You never come home unless I beg you to.

924
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,780
And then when you do, all you can do

925
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,060
is be disagreeable about the past.

926
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,540
What's the point?

927
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,700
Don't you think that...

928
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,180
everyone looks back on their childhood

929
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,140
with a certain amount of bitterness
and regret about something?

930
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,540
It doesn't have to ruin
your life, darling.

931
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,140
You're a big girl now.

932
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,740
Aren't you tired of it all?

933
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,580
Bore, bore, bore.

934
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,081
Life marches by, Chels.

935
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,844
I suggest you get on with it.

936
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,180
Have a wonderful trip, darling.
And don't worry.

937
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,660
Billy will take good care of us.

938
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,460
Okay.

939
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,940
Don't go getting involved
with any foreigners.

940
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,620
Right.

941
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,260
Let me have your bag, Chels.

942
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,203
Good-bye, kid.

943
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,380
Okay.

944
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,460
You going to be okay now?

945
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,820
Oh, sure.

946
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,700
- Behave yourself.
- Yeah. Hey, listen.

947
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,220
You guys behave yourself too, now.

948
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,220
We will, okay.
Norman, bye.

949
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,685
You work on that Parcheesi game.

950
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,420
Good luck, everybody.

951
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,460
Ethel, thank you so much.
We had a great time.

952
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,060
Thank you.
I'm so happy you came.

953
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,366
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

954
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,580
Just want you guys to know

955
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,887
that I'm not about to take
any crap from you.

956
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,180
Well, gentlemen,

957
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,020
it's a beautiful day.

958
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,700
We're going fishing.

959
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,740
What?
We're going what?

960
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,420
Fishing.
You remember fishing, Norman.

961
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,980
You're going to show Billy
what life is all about on Golden Pond.

962
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,220
Come on, Billy.

963
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,100
Bullshit.

964
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,620
I beg your pardon?

965
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,660
Does that mean you can't wait
to get out there

966
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,540
or that it's not your cup of tea?

967
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,380
It's bullshit.
That's all.

968
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,220
I see. Well, come on,
Norman.

969
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,846
Let's get ready.

970
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,180
You like that word, don't you?

971
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,740
Bullshit.

972
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,620
Yeah.

973
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,291
It's a good word.

974
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,288
Okay, Grandpa, do your stuff.

975
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,860
Hey, hey!

976
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,780
Pretty slick, huh?

977
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,900
Look at this.

978
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,180
This was Chelsea's
when she was about your age.

979
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,540
She caught some respectable fish
wearing this.

980
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,768
I'm surprised you still kept it
if it's Chelsea's.

981
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,620
I might not stick around here.

982
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:56,100
I might just haul my ass
out to Wyoming or Puerto Rico.

983
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,645
One of those places.

984
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,980
Listen, I know
I'm just being dumped here.

985
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,100
Which is like my middle name.

986
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,260
You turkeys don't want me.

987
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,260
Bullshit.

988
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,540
I'm 67 years older than you.

989
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,020
How do you know what I want?

990
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,300
We're going fishing now.

991
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,180
We want you to go along.

992
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,020
If you want to come with us, I suggest

993
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,140
you get your ass down to the dock
in two minutes.

994
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,607
Okay, Miss Turkey, let's go.

995
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,042
Here he is.

996
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,340
I...

997
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,540
I thought I might just sorta come along

998
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,087
and see what this bullshit is all about.

999
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,820
Get in.

1000
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,540
You look very handsome
in that fishing vest.

1001
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,860
Oh, thank you!

1002
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,567
I mean... thank you.

1003
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,524
So, how fast does
this old tub go anyway?

1004
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,004
All right!

1005
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,220
Go up this time.

1006
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,288
Not just back.
Up and back, come on.

1007
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,100
Come on, nothing to be afraid of.

1008
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,460
Backflip's one of the easiest dives.

1009
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,700
Oh, yeah? Then why don't
you come and try it?

1010
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,340
Norman, you stay right where you are.

1011
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,841
Dive, boy.

1012
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,740
All right.

1013
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,940
One...

1014
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,060
two...

1015
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,321
three!

1016
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,340
Ouch!

1017
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,700
Good God!

1018
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,820
That wasn't it.

1019
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,540
Thanks for telling me.

1020
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,700
Norman, we've got him for a whole month.

1021
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,768
Don't kill him the first week.

1022
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,220
This is it?

1023
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,926
This is it.

1024
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,122
Give me your hook.

1025
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:10,940
You got to be patient
when you're fishing for trout, boy.

1026
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,140
There's a trout living in this cove

1027
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,580
that weighs 10 pounds
if he weighs an ounce.

1028
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,580
First saw him three or four years ago.

1029
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,980
Hooked him two years ago
and again last year.

1030
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,820
But he's a crafty old son of a bitch!

1031
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,684
It's your last chance, Walter!

1032
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,540
Called him Walter 'cause
he reminds me of Ethel's brother.

1033
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,620
He's fat, lazy, and ugly!

1034
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,688
Okay.
Throw her out.

1035
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,487
Let her out.
Thread your line.

1036
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,340
How is your line?

1037
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,420
On the bottom?

1038
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,100
If your line's floating,
it's on the bottom!

1039
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,580
That doesn't do you any good.
Bring it up!

1040
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,060
Bring it up, for Christ's sake!

1041
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,860
All right!

1042
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,580
Hey, man, you don't have to yell at me.

1043
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,060
Who do you think you are, anyway?

1044
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,162
Long John Silver?

1045
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,140
God.

1046
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,447
I'm sorry.

1047
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,407
That's okay.

1048
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,130
Having fun?

1049
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,140
Yeah.

1050
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,660
That's good.

1051
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,500
Better than cruising chicks, isn't it?

1052
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,180
No.

1053
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,090
I suppose not.

1054
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,500
For God's sake!

1055
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,860
What the hell are you doing out here?

1056
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,820
Brought you lunch!

1057
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,180
How the hell did you find us?

1058
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,940
You'll scare the fish.

1059
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,820
Ethel, this is supposed to be
a secret fishing place.

1060
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,260
Lucky guess.

1061
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,860
We don't need any lunch!

1062
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,420
We got more important things
going on here.

1063
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,700
Don't be an old poop.

1064
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,802
Billy might get hungry.

1065
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,443
Bye-bye.

1066
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,849
We ought to see what she brought us.

1067
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,540
Hold on, you son of bitch!

1068
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,780
What? What?

1069
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,260
Run with it!

1070
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,420
It's not Walter, but he's related.

1071
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,340
You ugly old son of a bitch!

1072
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,540
- San Frantastic!
- I love you, I love you!

1073
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,580
Get the net, boy.

1074
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,648
We're going to have trout
for dinner tonight!

1075
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,140
Not the little one, the big one!
It's in back of me.

1076
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,561
It ain't no stupid sunfish!

1077
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,100
Here you go, baby.

1078
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,180
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1079
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,900
Oh, lovely!

1080
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,540
Get the net down underneath him.

1081
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,540
Lovely.
Bring it up.

1082
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,660
Oh, wow!

1083
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,500
Look at that beauty.

1084
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,284
Yes, siree.

1085
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,540
This...

1086
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,180
is a trout.

1087
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,820
A rainbow trout.

1088
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,365
Get going, boy!

1089
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,460
Norman, we've caught eight million fish.

1090
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,780
Are you sure none of these is Walter?

1091
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,700
Yep, Walter is humongous.

1092
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,780
Those fish you got there
are little mothers.

1093
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,580
They're disgusting little mothers.

1094
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,860
You got something
against fish guts, boy?

1095
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,820
Yeech!

1096
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,820
Hey Norman, can I ask you something?

1097
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,460
How did you get Ethel anyway?

1098
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,300
What?

1099
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,620
I sent away for her.

1100
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,300
Two box tops from Quaker Oats.

1101
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,140
Come on, don't bullshit me, man.

1102
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,580
I met Ethel when I was a principal

1103
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,380
and she was a substitute teacher.

1104
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,300
She was the prettiest thing
I'd ever seen.

1105
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,220
So I told her she made
my heart go pitter-pat.

1106
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,900
She fell in love with me immediately.

1107
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,300
Is that the way Norman got you, Ethel?

1108
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,340
Don't be silly, he didn't get me at all.

1109
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,761
I won him in a contest.
He was the booby prize.

1110
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,420
Has he got you you cleaning
those stupid fish?

1111
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,180
That's right, he cleans the stupid ones,

1112
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,340
I clean the smart ones.

1113
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,340
Fortunately, the smart ones
are too smart to get caught.

1114
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,180
That's why they're in schools.

1115
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,740
Come on in, Norman.
Get me a fire going.

1116
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,900
It's going to be a bit nippy tonight.

1117
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,740
You hear that, boy?
Get a fire going.

1118
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,460
Norman, for Pete's sake!

1119
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,700
Billy doesn't have to do
all your chores.

1120
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,600
What's the point in having a dwarf
if he doesn't do chores?

1121
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,100
Damn!

1122
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,060
You got the match backwards.
Want me to do it?

1123
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,050
I think I know how to light a fire,
for Christ's sake.

1124
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,860
What are you reading?

1125
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,260
A Tale of Two Cities.

1126
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,740
Ah, très bien, très bien!

1127
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,580
Norman! Norman!

1128
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,660
You've set the house on fire!

1129
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,740
- What the hell's going on?
- Get a bucket!

1130
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,524
- What?
- Get a bucket!

1131
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,300
Good for you, Billy.
Good for you.

1132
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,780
Let's have the screen.

1133
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,860
The screen.

1134
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,220
- It's warm.
- Yep. Right there.

1135
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:56,900
That's all right.

1136
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,980
For God's sake!
You made a hell of a mess!

1137
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,020
What?

1138
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,940
Norman, he just...

1139
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,327
don't yell at me, man.

1140
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,100
I guess it's...

1141
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,204
not safe to have me around here, is it?

1142
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,170
What are you staring at me for,
you little son of a bitch?

1143
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:43,220
You mustn't let Norman upset you, Billy.

1144
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,940
Sure.

1145
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,220
He wasn't yelling at you, you know.

1146
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,220
Sounds like he is yelling at me.

1147
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,940
No, he was yelling at life.

1148
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,780
What the heck does that mean?

1149
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,660
It means he's like an old lion.

1150
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,969
He has to remind himself
that he can still roar.

1151
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,420
Billy...

1152
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,820
sometimes...

1153
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,900
you have to look hard at a person

1154
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,940
and remember...

1155
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,008
that he's doing the best he can.

1156
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,460
He's just trying to find his way,
that's all.

1157
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,451
Just like you.

1158
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,420
How's my little petunia?

1159
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,620
Hey, Norman!

1160
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,180
Norman!

1161
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,420
Hey, Norm!

1162
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,180
Yeah, listen, I was wondering,

1163
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,020
can I take the Thayer IV
for a little spin?

1164
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,420
Absolutely not!

1165
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,740
Aw, come on.
I know how to drive.

1166
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,620
I think it would be all right.
Don't you, Norman?

1167
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,380
Good God!

1168
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,060
Can you be careful?

1169
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,925
Oh, sure.

1170
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,260
Norman, what the hell are you doing?

1171
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,140
- Ruff!
- Come on.

1172
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,780
It's really happened, hasn't it?

1173
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,123
You have lost your marbles.

1174
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,780
Here.
I'll get the big net.

1175
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,860
You two will be sorry.

1176
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:09,140
The loons have been calling
for rain all night long.

1177
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,940
"Rain! Rain!

1178
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,020
Bring us some rain!"

1179
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,540
That's what the loons said, huh?

1180
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,740
Allons, debut.

1181
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,540
Je viens.

1182
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,300
That's French, you know.
It means, "I'm coming."

1183
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,220
I'll get la port.

1184
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,580
Oh, no, no, no!

1185
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,940
I'm sorry.

1186
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,740
Ethel, allow me.

1187
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,860
I don't believe it!

1188
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,580
Yeah.

1189
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,620
Norman and I fixed the mother.

1190
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,484
Oh, great!

1191
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,300
That's the only place
that we haven't looked

1192
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:06,620
for this stupid son-of-a-bitch fish.

1193
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,980
Might as well give it a try, huh?

1194
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,340
They call this Purgatory Cove, boy.

1195
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,740
See those rocks?

1196
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,780
They eat boats.

1197
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,940
Do you know the way?

1198
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,340
Of course I know the way.

1199
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,540
Get up on the deck.

1200
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,540
Tell me where the rocks are.

1201
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,608
Come on, up there.

1202
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,220
All right?

1203
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,890
- Okay.
- Here we go.

1204
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,220
Hey, there's one coming up.

1205
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,820
- Which side?
- On the left.

1206
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,524
- Port, boy.
- Okay, port.

1207
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,380
All right.

1208
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:50,940
Another one on port.

1209
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,700
Oh, there's one coming up right here.

1210
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,610
Oh, shit.
The starboard.

1211
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:08,660
Okay, there's one port side.

1212
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,922
All right, starboard, over there.

1213
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,860
Now... doesn't this look like
the ideal hiding place

1214
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,962
for a crafty old son of a bitch?

1215
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,980
Well, the fish aren't just gonna
jump in the boat, you know.

1216
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,491
Get it in gear, turkey!

1217
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,250
Getting dark, Chelsea.

1218
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,700
Who are you calling Chelsea?

1219
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,020
I'm Billy, remember?

1220
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,540
Come on, man.

1221
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,180
Hey, are you okay?

1222
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,660
'Course I'm okay!

1223
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,524
Okay.

1224
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,460
We better hurry and catch Walter, huh?

1225
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,180
I mean, I'm not gonna
be here much longer.

1226
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,760
Neither am I.

1227
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,340
I'll miss you, Norman.

1228
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,566
What?

1229
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,540
Norman!
Hey, Norman, look! Shit!

1230
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:25,740
I got the mother!

1231
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,060
I got him!

1232
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,540
Well, get the net, Norman!

1233
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,580
Get it in gear, turkey!

1234
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,364
I got him!

1235
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,811
What the heck is that?

1236
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,409
My God!

1237
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,820
It's a dead loon, Norman.

1238
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,180
The poor thing.

1239
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,740
Oh, it smells, too.

1240
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,002
Here. Hold on.

1241
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,006
Let it go.

1242
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,890
Hey, Norman?

1243
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,460
Are you afraid of dying?

1244
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,820
What?

1245
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,340
Are you afraid to die?

1246
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:59,284
What the hell kind of question is that?

1247
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,220
I was just wondering, that's all.

1248
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,780
I don't know...

1249
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,660
why everybody has to talk
about everything all the time.

1250
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,660
Let's go home, boy.

1251
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,660
Are you sure we're gonna be able
to get out of here?

1252
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,809
'Course we can.
Pull up the anchor.

1253
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,123
Get up on deck.

1254
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,020
Hey, get back here.

1255
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,820
I forgot you're a hotshot boat driver.

1256
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,140
Here, you take the wheel
and I'll navigate.

1257
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,980
Yeah?

1258
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,460
Well, you know,
I'm not afraid to do this.

1259
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,380
I know. Just...
take us real slow.

1260
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,927
Do what I tell you.

1261
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,322
Okay, turn it over.

1262
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,980
All right.
Take it forward.

1263
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,970
Now give her a hard left.

1264
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,740
Okay.

1265
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,060
Port.

1266
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,049
Okay, good.

1267
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,883
All right.
Starboard again.

1268
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,940
Okay.

1269
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,900
Port.
To the left.

1270
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,500
Good God!
Reverse!

1271
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,460
Full throttle, reverse!

1272
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,420
- Reverse!
- Oh, God!

1273
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,885
Reverse!

1274
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,060
Norman?

1275
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,685
Norman!

1276
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,820
Chels...
Chels...

1277
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,580
- Chels... oh!
- Norman!

1278
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:19,500
Norman!

1279
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,728
Norman, please!

1280
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:28,380
Oh, God, Norman!

1281
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,980
Oh, Norman, I'm sorry!

1282
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,048
I'm sorry!

1283
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,220
Hold on.

1284
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,607
I'm gonna bring you over here.

1285
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,580
Norman.

1286
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,842
Norman, grab on.

1287
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,608
Grab onto the rock.

1288
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:57,046
Grab onto the rock.

1289
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,165
I'm sorry.

1290
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,645
Billy!

1291
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,140
Come on now.

1292
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,084
Hold onto the rock.

1293
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,660
Oh, Charlie, thank God you're here!

1294
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,140
Come on! We're going for a ride!

1295
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,700
Norman and the kid are out on the lake.

1296
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,980
They should have been home hours ago.

1297
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,286
Hurry up.

1298
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:56,340
Norman isn't ever late.

1299
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,523
- I don't understand it.
- Oh, he'll be all right.

1300
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,780
Ethel, we've been back
and forth here three times.

1301
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,100
They must have pulled up somewhere.

1302
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,060
You don't suppose
he would've gone in there,

1303
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,340
do you, Charlie?

1304
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,820
He's not that crazy.

1305
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,340
Yes, he is.

1306
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,340
Let's go.

1307
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,580
I'm not gonna drive my boat
into Purgatory Cove.

1308
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,540
Yes, you are, Charlie.

1309
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,005
I'll point the way.

1310
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,140
Holy mackinoly.

1311
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:31,220
It's full of rocks, Charlie.
Look out.

1312
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,060
- To the left. Okay... Okay...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1313
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,700
- Am I all right?
- Okay, keep to the right.

1314
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,780
Keep to the right.

1315
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:43,140
- Keep to the right!
- All right, I am!

1316
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,180
That's better, that's better.
Okay.

1317
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,300
Straight ahead.

1318
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:48,660
See anything?

1319
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,540
- A lot of rocks here.
- Oh, Lordy.

1320
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,420
Norman Thayer, Jr.,

1321
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,444
where the hell are you?

1322
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,500
Charlie!
There they are, Charlie.

1323
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,490
Oh, my God!

1324
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,928
Norman!

1325
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,060
Ethel!

1326
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:30,020
You shouldn't be out here
this time of night.

1327
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,380
You poop!

1328
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,051
You goddamn poop!

1329
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,420
How are my boys?

1330
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,780
I'm off to the woods to find mushrooms

1331
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,660
or flowers or something.

1332
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,740
Are you gonna be all right?

1333
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,605
Bye-bye.

1334
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,540
Hey!

1335
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:27,281
Where do you juvenile delinquents
think you're off to?

1336
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,260
Norman, I thought you were
in too much pain to exert yourself.

1337
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,220
Well... well, I am.

1338
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:38,140
I'm just doing this for Billy.

1339
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,100
Give the poor boy another chance
to catch a fish.

1340
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,740
We've been doing goddamn
jigsaw puzzles for a week.

1341
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:48,180
You will stay in our cove, won't you?

1342
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,620
There aren't any trout left in our cove.

1343
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:53,260
Norman, we have enough trout
left in the fridge

1344
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,540
to last us six years.

1345
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,980
But we haven't caught Walter yet.

1346
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,129
Never mind.
We'll stay in the damn cove.

Mommy!

1363
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,700
How did you get here?

1364
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,380
I rented a car.

1365
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,380
A Volare made by Plymouth.

1366
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,420
Look at you.

1367
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,780
My God, you've had this jacket
as long as I can remember.

1368
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:05,420
It looks it, doesn't it?

1369
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,580
It looks great.

1370
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,620
How was your trip?

1371
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,740
Not bad.
How's the kid?

1372
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,060
You still got him or did you drown him?

1373
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,060
We still got him.

1374
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:17,140
He's out there fishing
with his best buddy.

1375
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,100
You can see him.

1376
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,340
Where's the Thayer IV?

1377
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,700
Charlie's fixing her.

1378
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,740
Norman and Billy tried to drive her

1379
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,220
through a rock in Purgatory Cove.

1380
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,460
Did they get hurt?

1381
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,420
Norman got a bump on the head
which he's playing to the hilt,

1382
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,340
but he's all right.

1383
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,410
They're both fine, thank God.

1384
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:51,700
Do you still have Bill,
or did you drown him?

1385
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,460
Oh, I still have him.
He had to get back to the coast.

1386
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,460
He had a mouth that needed looking into.

1387
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:03,140
So, Norman and Billy
have gotten along all right?

1388
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,420
Billy is the happiest thing

1389
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,460
that's happened to Norman
since Roosevelt.

1390
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:11,042
I should have rented him
a 13-year-old boy years ago.

1391
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,970
You could have traded me in.

1392
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:23,140
Except I think he probably
makes a better son than I did.

1393
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:26,005
You made a very nice daughter.

1394
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,140
How come it's so easy?

1395
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,980
What do you mean, darling?

1396
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,140
Why wasn't that old son of a bitch
ever my friend?

1397
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,980
You're sounding very childish.

1398
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,900
Of course he was your friend.

1399
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,820
He's your father.

1400
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:45,460
Chelsea, you're such a nice person.

1401
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,166
Can't you think
of something nice to say?

1402
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:54,100
I married Bill in Brussels.

1403
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:57,180
You did what in Brussels?

1404
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,740
I married Bill.

1405
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,460
Does it count in this country?

1406
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,860
'Fraid so!

1407
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:06,020
Bless you, darling.
Congratulations.

1408
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,500
- Nothing to it.
- Norman will be so pleased.

1409
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,100
Yeah, sure.

1410
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,580
What do you suppose he's gonna say?

1411
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,940
"Hey, Chels... fantastic.

1412
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:19,900
I'm so happy that you finally
got your life together

1413
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,660
and I'm so proud."

1414
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,980
And he will be proud, but...

1415
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,220
No, he won't.
No, he won't.

1416
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,180
And you know why?
Because he doesn't care.

1417
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,487
He is a selfish son of a bitch!

1418
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,923
That old son of a bitch
happens to be my husband.

1419
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,260
Oh... shit!

1420
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,940
Oh, shit!

1421
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,620
Norman!
Shit!

1422
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,140
Don't get so excited.

1423
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,100
It's only a sunfish.

1424
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,780
Only a sunfish?

1425
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,100
Are you doubting the word of a genius?

1426
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,580
There are no respectable trout
in this cove.

1427
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,460
Chased them out years ago.

1428
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,220
Well, it's doing a pretty good
trout imitation.

1429
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:12,731
Get the net!

1430
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,140
Good God!
It's Walter!

1431
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:24,420
What the hell you doing here,
you son of a bitch?

1432
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,700
Keep that line tight, boy!

1433
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,380
Oh, you beauty!
Keep your line tight.

1434
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,380
Keep reeling in.

1435
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,460
A little closer.
A little closer.

1436
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:37,281
Oh, look at that!

1437
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:40,340
Have we caught Walter?

1438
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,602
We caught Walter, the son of a bitch!

1439
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,540
Chels.

1440
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,860
I brought your sweater and your shoes.

1441
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,420
And your car's out front.

1442
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,500
I'm such an ass, I'm sorry.

1443
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,100
I'm sorry, too.

1444
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,900
But, darling, you're wrong
about your dad.

1445
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,140
He does care.
He cares deeply.

1446
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:13,801
It's just that he's an absolute mutt
about telling anyone.

1447
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:17,940
I know he'd walk through fire for me.

1448
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:20,100
And he'd walk through fire for you, too.

1449
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:24,205
And if you don't understand that,
you're not looking closely enough.

1450
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,100
I don't even know him.

1451
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,900
Chels, Norman is 80 years old.

1452
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,260
He has heart palpitations
and trouble remembering things.

1453
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:39,140
Just exactly when do you expect
this friendship to begin?

1454
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,660
I'm afraid of him.

1455
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,740
Well, he's afraid of you.

1456
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,980
So you should get along fine.

1457
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,340
Here he comes, Chels.

1458
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:48,807
Talk to him.

1459
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:57,844
Hey, hey.

1460
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,620
Hey!

1461
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,900
Look at you!

1462
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,260
- Hi, kid.
- Where's the dentist?

1463
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,980
He had to get back.

1464
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,740
- He'll call you tonight.
- Okay.

1465
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,220
- Hello, Norman.
- Well, well, well...

1466
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,380
Chelsea, we caught Walter.

1467
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,260
Do you know who Walter is?

1468
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,100
- Well, I have a feeling he's a fish.
- Yes.

1469
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,700
A humongous fish.

1470
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,180
And we caught him today,
didn't we, Norman?

1471
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:27,740
Well, let me see him.

1472
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,260
We let him go.

1473
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,020
Yeah, we let him go.

1474
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,460
I think I've heard this story before.

1475
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,980
No, no, it's true.

1476
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:37,740
See, Norman and I thought that
if Walter's lived this long,

1477
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,140
we should let him keep on living.

1478
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:41,380
I'm gonna go tell Ethel.

1479
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:42,900
Hey, Norman!

1480
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,260
We caught the son of a bitch!
We caught him!

1481
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,885
Good job!

1482
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,580
You got yourself a friend, huh?

1483
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:01,401
He's all right.
Hasn't been too difficult.

1484
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,100
How's your forehead?

1485
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:08,900
- Your...
- Oh, this. It's all right.

1486
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,571
A lot of pain.
Nothing to worry about.

1487
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,568
Norman, I want to talk to you.

1488
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,340
What seems to be the problem?

1489
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:25,940
There's no problem.
I just...

1490
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,963
I want to talk to you, I...

1491
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:32,820
I think that...

1492
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,700
maybe you and I should have
the kind of relationship

1493
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,780
that we're supposed to have.

1494
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,820
What kind of relationship is that?

1495
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,100
Well, you know, like a...

1496
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,460
like a father and a daughter.

1497
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,540
Just in the nick of time?

1498
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,980
Worried about the will, are you?

1499
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:51,420
Well, I'm leaving everything to you,
except what I'm taking with me.

1500
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,260
Just stop it!

1501
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,780
I don't want anything!

1502
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,380
It seems that you and me

1503
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,460
have been mad at each other for so long.

1504
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,940
I didn't know we were mad,

1505
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,884
I thought we just didn't
like each other.

1506
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:14,200
I want to be your friend.

1507
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,060
This mean you...

1508
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,900
come around more often?

1509
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,240
It'll mean a lot to your mother.

1510
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,722
I'll come around more often.

1511
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,324
Well...

1512
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,580
Yep!

1513
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:41,300
I got married in Brussels.

1514
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,380
You did?

1515
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,700
In Brussels!

1516
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,380
He makes me very happy.

1517
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,540
Well, good.

1518
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,980
Does he speak English?

1519
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,500
Bill.
I married Bill.

1520
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,140
Bill? Oh, Bill!

1521
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,620
I'm glad, Chelsea.

1522
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,340
That's San Frantastic.

1523
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:02,060
- What?
- Is Billy gonna be living with you?

1524
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,900
Well, good.

1525
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,300
Isn't that something?
Good for you!

1526
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:08,820
You know something?

1527
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:11,180
I got him doing the backflip
just like a pro.

1528
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,020
Oh, yeah?
That's great.

1529
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:15,980
Yeah, want me to get him down
to show you?

1530
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:19,220
- No, no. Not right now.
- Okay.

1531
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,540
Oh, that's right.

1532
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:24,220
You were never
a great backflipper, were you?

1533
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,460
I was always too fat, remember?

1534
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,660
Yeah, I do remember that now.

1535
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,580
Well, probably...

1536
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:34,140
a lot easier for a boy.

1537
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,924
I beg your pardon.

1538
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,540
Do you want to see me do a backflip?

1539
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:46,260
I am going to do a goddamn backflip.

1540
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:48,500
Chelsea, you don't have to.

1541
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,968
I want to.

1542
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:05,860
Make sure you go up, not just back.

1543
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,260
Up and back.

1544
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,860
Oh, I'm scared.

1545
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:10,980
Don't be scared.

1546
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,606
The backflip is one
of the easiest dives of all.

1547
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,540
I'm scared anyway.

1548
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,180
Don't do it.

1549
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,340
Doesn't matter if you don't do
the stupid dive.

1550
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:23,683
It's not important.

1551
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:31,380
I did it!

1552
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:32,900
She did it!

1553
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,820
Chelsea did a backflip!

1554
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,620
I went over!

1555
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:39,380
It was lousy, but I did it!

1556
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,500
Good for you!

1557
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,409
Yay!

1558
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,900
You could come out
instead of going to Florida.

1559
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,940
I will discuss it.

1560
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:50,180
If I can persuade Norman
that Los Angeles

1561
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,900
is part of the United States,
it shouldn't be too much trouble.

1562
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,540
Norman!

1563
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:58,180
What in the world are you doing now?

1564
01:39:58,280 --> 01:39:59,860
Hey, you're a cool breeze.

1565
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,180
Be sure to take a break from cruising.

1566
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,740
Wow!
Thank you, Captain.

1567
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,180
Norman, he can't take
that fool thing on the plane.

1568
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:08,300
Yes, he can.

1569
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,980
Got something for you, too.

1570
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:14,820
You know what this is?

1571
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:17,900
University of Pennsylvania
Diving Finals, 1921.

1572
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,340
Second place.

1573
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,940
Oh, thanks.

1574
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,820
- Now I can retire.
- Show that to your new husband.

1575
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:27,651
Maybe he'll give us a discount
on dental work.

1576
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:31,980
Guess I'll be seeing you, you nitwit.

1577
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,900
- Okay.
- I'll miss you, Norman.

1578
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,780
Bye-bye, darling.

1579
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,406
- Good-bye, woman.
- Bye-bye, Billy.

1580
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,780
Well...

1581
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,220
good-bye, Norman.

1582
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,765
Dad.

1583
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:12,500
Come on, Norman.

1584
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:16,620
Let's get these last boxes
out to the car and be gone.

1585
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,643
For God's sake!

1586
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:22,300
Not too heavy, is it?

1587
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,180
Of course it's not too heavy...

1588
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,060
God, this is heavy!

1589
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:27,620
You're trying to kill me.

1590
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:30,220
I've thought about it.
Put it down if it's too much.

1591
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,860
- What the hell you have in here?
- My mother's china.

1592
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,580
Put the box down, darling.

1593
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:36,260
Your mother never liked me.

1594
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,203
'Course she did.

1595
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,540
Norman, what is it?

1596
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,460
What's the matter, darling?

1597
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:47,449
What's the matter?

1598
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,521
Oh, my God!

1599
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:54,740
Norman! Norman!

1600
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:57,260
My darling...

1601
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,260
my darling.

1602
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,010
I'll get your medicine.

1603
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:07,728
Here, Norman.

1604
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,740
Take this, darling.

1605
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,180
Put it under your tongue.

1606
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,100
- What is it?
- Nitroglycerin.

1607
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:18,409
Put it under your tongue.

1608
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:27,060
Dear God, don't take him now.

1609
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:28,580
You don't want him.

1610
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:31,380
He's just an old poop.

1611
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,380
Norman! Norman!

1612
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,660
Maybe we should call a doctor.

1613
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,260
Oh, yes, I'll get the telephone.

1614
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:43,126
I'll get the telephone.

1615
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,700
Hello, hello.

1616
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,900
Dear God.
Dear God.

1617
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,380
How are you feeling, Norman?

1618
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,380
Pretty good.
How are you?

1619
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:57,940
How's the angina?

1620
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:01,540
- The what?
- The pain, dammit!

1621
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:04,420
Pretty good, as pain goes.

1622
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:05,780
This stupid operator!

1623
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,060
Hello. Hello.

1624
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:11,300
Hello, hello, hello.

1625
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,020
What's the matter with her?

1626
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:16,220
She's slow.

1627
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:17,900
How are you feeling now?

1628
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,340
I don't know.

1629
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,340
Are you planning to die?

1630
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,860
Is that what you're up to?

1631
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:28,500
While I'm waiting for this moron
to answer the telephone,

1632
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,060
let me say something to you,
Norman Thayer Jr.,

1633
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:32,740
I'd rather you didn't.

1634
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:35,180
- Really?
- Yes.

1635
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,380
Oh, this stupid, stupid operator.

1636
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:40,780
I'm going to have to call
the hospital directly.

1637
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,460
The phone book...
I'll get the phone book.

1638
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:47,100
Ethel.

1639
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,500
- What is it?
- Will you come here?

1640
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,965
Oh, my God.

1641
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,060
Yes, Norman?

1642
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,620
My darling.

1643
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,420
Ethel.

1644
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,020
Yes. I'm here, Norman.

1645
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:03,340
Ethel.

1646
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,020
Yes, yes, yes?

1647
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,540
Ethel.

1648
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,580
What is it, Norman?

1649
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:14,900
I think I'm feeling all right now.

1650
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,380
My God, are you serious?

1651
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,420
My heart stopped hurting.

1652
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,660
Maybe I'm dead.

1653
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,420
I love you so much.

1654
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,340
Sorry about your mother's china.

1655
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,900
Why did you strain yourself?
You know better.

1656
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,380
I was showing off.
Trying to turn you on.

1657
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,100
Well, you succeeded.

1658
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:35,420
No need for you to try
that sort of thing again.

1659
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,100
Good.

1660
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,860
You know something?

1661
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:41,900
This is the first time
that I've really felt

1662
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,420
that we were gonna die.

1663
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,500
I've known it all along.

1664
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,380
When I looked at you here,

1665
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,060
on the floor,

1666
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,900
I could actually see you dead.

1667
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,580
I could see you...

1668
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:56,820
I could see you in your blue suit
and white starched shirt

1669
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:59,460
in Thomas' Funeral Parlor
on Bradshaw Street.

1670
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:02,500
- How'd I look?
- Not good, Norman.

1671
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,860
You've been talking about death
ever since we met.

1672
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,500
But this is the first time
I really felt it.

1673
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,329
How's it feel?

1674
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,900
It feels odd.

1675
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,900
Cold... I guess.

1676
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,620
Not... not that bad really.

1677
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,980
Not so... frightening.

1678
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:25,260
Almost comforting.
Not such a bad place to go.

1679
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:28,340
I don't know.

1680
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,540
Oh, Norman.

1681
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:32,940
Oh, God.

1682
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,060
Well...

1683
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:38,340
don't you wanna say good-bye
to the lake?

1684
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:40,100
Do you think you're strong enough?

1685
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,009
I think so.

1686
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:49,060
If I fall over face first in the water,
you'll know I wasn't.

1687
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:51,380
Well, take it easy, for God's sake.

1688
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:54,290
I'm only good for one near miss a day.

1689
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,700
Hello, there.

1690
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,700
Hi.

1691
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,420
Want to dance?

1692
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,460
Or would you rather just suck face?

1693
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:06,131
Norman, you really are a case.

1694
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:12,060
Ethel, listen.

1695
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:14,020
The loons.

1696
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:17,010
They've come around to say good-bye.

1697
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:36,060
Just two of them now.

1698
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,664
Their baby's all grown up

1699
01:46:37,764 --> 01:46:40,927
and moved to Los Angeles or somewhere.
