mean to steal the map ?

- It, it just sort of--
- Of course you didn't mean to steal it.

- Sir ?

of testing my handiwork.

We're not suggesting that, sir.
It's just--

That I let you borrow
my map.

just to test your creation ?

Yes.
You really are a clever boy.

Why did they have to die ?

You might as well say,
"Why do we have to have evil ?"

Oh, we wouldn't dream of asking
a question like that, sir.

Yes. Why do we have
to have evil ?

That's concentrated evil.

One drop of that could turn
you all into hermit crabs.

I'm sorry, sir.

1409

if there's, um,

any chance we might
have our old jobs back, sir.

- Oh, you certainly were
appallingly bad robbers.
- Yes, sir.

very extrovert and vengeful with you.
