1
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:41,018
This is the Persian Empire

2
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:43,494
known today as Iran.

3
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:48,542
For 2,500 years, this land
was ruled by a series of kings

4
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:50,817
known as “Shahs‟.

5
00:00:51,724 --> 00:00:56,048
In 1950, the people of Iran
elected Mohammad Mosaddegh

6
00:00:56,298 --> 00:00:59,229
a secular democrat, as prime minister.

7
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,029
He nationalized British and US
petroleum holdings,

8
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,963
returning Iran’s oil to its people.

9
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:09,229
But in 1953,

10
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,118
the US and Great Britain
engineered a coup d’etat

11
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:17,163
that deposed Mosaddegh,
and installed Reza Pahlavi as Shah.

12
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:21,781
The young child was known
for opulence and excess.

13
00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:24,866
His wife was rumored to bathe in milk,

14
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,191
while the Shah had his lunches
flown in by concord from Paris.

15
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:31,998
The people starved.

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,873
The Shah kept power through
his ruthless internal police,

17
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,360
the Savak.

18
00:01:39,822 --> 00:01:42,881
An era of torture and fear began.

19
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:48,627
He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran,

20
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,648
enraging the the mostly
traditional Shia population.

21
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:58,475
In 1979,
the people of Iran overthrew the Shah.

22
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:05,045
The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
returned to rule Iran.

23
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:13,259
It descended into score settling,
death squads and chaos.

24
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:19,701
Dying of cancer, the Shah
was given asylum in the US.

25
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:25,365
The Iranian people took
to the streets outside the US embassy,

26
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:29,036
demanding that the Shah
be returned, tried…

27
00:02:30,446 --> 00:02:31,349
and hanged.

31
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:43,361
The carnival is a
little bigger today, huh?

32
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:47,815
The windows are supposed
to be bulletproof, right?

33
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:50,154
They have never been tested.

34
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,648
Okay, you just need to finish filling out

35
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:54,174
this section here.

36
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,556
We need some security.

37
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,622
Yes, it is your responsibility—

38
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,386
They drew over the walls.

39
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:53,576
We should all split.

40
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:55,047
I’m gonna close up my office.

41
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,788
My God!

42
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:18,087
Marins to Number 1.

43
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:19,047
Full back.

44
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:19,898
— Look, I need police,
— Can anyone hear me?

45
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:20,817
— I need police right now.
— We’re on the second floor.

46
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:21,598
— You understand me?
— We need help.

47
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:22,737
Right now, goddamn it!

48
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:24,745
Can anybody hear me?

49
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:25,577
There is a breach.

50
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,208
Burn everything! Burn it, now!

51
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:32,177
Alright burn everything,
all the files, file cabinets, safe.

52
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:48,066
Lets get a cart over here.

53
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:49,168
Burn it all, come on!

54
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:51,556
Burn everything, including
the classified. Everything!

55
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:58,878
Don’t fucking shoot anybody.

56
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:01,621
You don’t want to be
the son of a bitch who started the war.

57
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,573
They need an hour to burn the classified.

58
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:05,526
I need you to hold.

59
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:07,038
If you shoot one person,

60
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:09,638
they’re gonna kill every
single one of us in here.

61
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:21,506
I’m telling you if we’re going to go,
we need to go now!

62
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:23,658
— And we need to make a decision, and—
— Joe can we— Joe can we wait,

63
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:25,419
can we wait until
the Iranian police come?

64
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:26,839
— No!
— They’re not coming.

65
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,699
How do you know they’re not coming?

66
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:29,722
They may well be coming.

67
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:31,028
The police have abandoned their post—

68
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:33,557
If the police are not coming, okay,
then the army’s gonna come.

69
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:34,399
The Prime Minister is not gonna let
the embassy be taken over.

70
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,017
I understand. The Prime Minister
may come tomorrow,

71
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:38,497
but the Komiteh are here today.

72
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,659
Alright, is there—is there any value
that we’re waiting 15—

73
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,429
Look at me!

74
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,730
No one is coming.

75
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:44,155
Burn it!
We have forty minutes.

76
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,630
Get it down to the incinerator,
in the vault. Now!

77
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:51,497
Tear gas is a last resort only.

78
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:54,190
<i>I repeat: only if you’re under threat.</i>

79
00:07:31,623 --> 00:07:36,097
In here, we are in America right now,
outside of these doors, we are in Iran!

80
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:37,026
I’m not going out there!

81
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:38,794
— They’re not safe here.
 Alright, first let’s get these—

82
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:40,969
If they get caught
applying for visas to the US…

83
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:42,460
You know what, lets—
lets wait five minutes.

84
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:44,842
We’re in the only building
with direct access to the street,

85
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:46,842
if we’re going to go,
then we need to go now!

86
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:48,586
— Yeah, I’m in.
— Yeah.

87
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:49,420
Yeah, lets go.

88
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,512
I’m going outside.

89
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:56,442
Why?

90
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:57,812
To reason them.

91
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:25,440
Open the door!

92
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:27,723
Open the door!

93
00:08:28,143 --> 00:08:29,723
Open this goddamn door!

94
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,863
You said you wanna see the world, Elton?

95
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:36,731
Let me in! Let me in!

96
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,578
— Burn it all, come on!
— Right come on, guys!

97
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,054
The safe and the filing cabinets get long.

98
00:08:56,774 --> 00:08:59,074
All four drawers,
I want them shredded, right now!

99
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:00,470
But the shred not fast enough.

100
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,493
Guys, get the visa plates.

101
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:06,955
All four, and anything
else you see out there.

102
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:09,312
If in doubt, you shred it.

103
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:14,491
We’ve got ten minutes,
lets go, go, go, everything!

104
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:24,981
Get the shredder.

105
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:26,608
There are no police.

106
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:32,244
— Okay.
— Come on.

107
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:34,395
— Where do we go?
— We gotta get off the streets.

108
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,379
This way, up here to the left.

109
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:08,538
These fucks hit us,
we can’t hit ‘em back?

110
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,538
Mossaddegh, we did it to them first.

111
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,628
The Soviets would put up with this shit,
they would fucking invade them.

112
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:13,273
Shaffer!

113
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:16,014
Sir, what d’you expect? We helped the guy
torture and deball an entire population.

114
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:16,778
How many were there?

115
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:18,448
At least fifty. We’re not sure.

116
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:19,769
Shaffer!

117
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:21,026
You still haven’t found Shaffer?

118
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:23,241
No I was screaming his name
’cos I was fucking ‘em.

119
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,379
It’s confirmed, sir, six escaped.

120
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:29,559
I was told five.

121
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:30,929
Now sir, apparently it’s six.

122
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:31,889
So what happened?

123
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,959
Not clear. We know they
escaped the embassy.

124
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:34,801
Where are they?

125
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,378
The Canadian Ambassador’s house.

126
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,142
Do they stay put?
Are we attempting a rescue?

127
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,656
I put through the Secretary of State.

128
00:11:39,937 --> 00:11:40,737
Yes.

129
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:42,191
Is White House joining?

130
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,281
They’re claiming the Embassy
was a den of espionage.

131
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,968
We wish it was a fucking den of espionage.

132
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:48,754
CIA’s got three people over there,
they don’t see a revolution coming?

133
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:50,452
Call it something other then intelligence.

134
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,166
Hold for the Chief of Staff.
Harding?

135
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,031
I’ll call him back.

136
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:55,850
They’re sticking to it, no release
till we expel the Shah.

137
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:57,298
Well, put him on a plane then, fuck him!

138
00:11:57,313 --> 00:11:58,695
He’s half dead and he’s in chemo.

139
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,592
Well, we took him in, he’s ours now.

140
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:03,042
Great, so we’ll take any prick
as long as he’s got cancer?

141
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,570
Just the pricks on our side.

142
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,858
So all of our other pricks
on their prick thrones

143
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,297
will know that when they
get thrown out on a rail,

144
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:09,894
they won’t get their
fucking spleens taken out

145
00:12:09,902 --> 00:12:11,730
by some camel vet in Sinai.

146
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:13,827
What about the six who are
with the Canadians?

147
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,838
We’ve got sixty in the Embassy
with guns to their heads right now.

148
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,108
The whole world is
watching the Embassy.

149
00:12:19,109 --> 00:12:20,591
That makes them safer
than the six on the street.

150
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:22,933
Bonnie Sauder’s saying
it will be over in twenty-four hours.

151
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:27,881
We leave the six where they are.

152
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,881
I’ll go brief the President.

153
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:34,175
Right, I’ll through it.

154
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:06,270
<i>Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, has
rounded up a gang of terrorist blamed</i>

155
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:10,097
<i>for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.</i>

156
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:14,341
<i>It says security at Khomeini’s home
now has been raised.</i>

157
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:19,271
<i>This by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran,</i>

158
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:22,942
<i>there is no change reported
in the hostage situation.</i>

159
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:26,847
<i>In this country, George Mitty died last
night, he was eighty five years old.</i>

160
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:29,573
Yeah.

161
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:32,033
Yes.

162
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:35,983
What?

163
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:38,723
<i>To begin with, of course,
we wanted to learn</i>

164
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:42,182
<i>about the hostages held in
the American Embassy compound.</i>

165
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:45,823
<i>They may not understand what their
ordeal means to their countrymen.</i>

166
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:48,353
<i>That this nation,
their nation, is outraged.</i>

167
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,909
<i>And we cannot really
know what it is like</i>

168
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:53,623
<i>inside the prison
that was once our embassy.</i>

169
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:58,496
<i>Actions of Iran have shocked
the civilized world.</i>

170
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:04,344
<i>Our embassy has been seized, and
more than sixty American citizens</i>

171
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:06,254
<i>continue to be held as hostages—</i>

172
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:10,454
<i>As the situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged for the hostages—</i>

00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:13,924
<i>the NBC situation in Iran
has changed however—</i>

174
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:26,038
What happened?

175
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:29,405
Six of them went out a back exit.

176
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:31,264
Brits turned them away,

177
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:34,005
Kiwis turned them away,
Canadians took ‘em in.

178
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:36,325
Traffic calls them ‘House Guests’.

179
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:39,774
They haven’t left the Canadian
Ambassador’s house since it happened.

180
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:41,293
Why didn’t we get them ten weeks ago?

181
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:42,125
Too dangerous.

182
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:45,695
We got revolutionary guards going
door to door, like Jehovah’s Witnesses.

183
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:49,404
Half of them think that Khomeini’s been
too lenient on the ones in the Embassy.

184
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:50,514
What about the White House?

185
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:53,175
Carter’s shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

186
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,174
The Canadians are done,

187
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:56,663
they say they’re baring too much risk.

188
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:58,726
Their Foreign Secretary
corners Vance in Brussels,

189
00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:01,525
and told him she wants
the six of them out.

190
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,546
Who else knows?

191
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:03,945
Just the families.

192
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,095
Meanwhile, some genius in our Embassy

193
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:08,496
was keeping a mug book on
everybody who worked there.

194
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:10,036
Jesus Christ!

195
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:12,375
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

196
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:14,495
But now the bastards are using

197
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,975
sweatshop kids
to reassemble the shreds.

198
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:20,435
Once they reassemble that book,
they’ll know six Americans got out

199
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,036
and they’ll know what they look like.

200
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:24,575
Standing room only for
beheadings in the square.

201
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:25,696
Who’s handling?

202
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:28,576
State is coordinating in-house.

203
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:30,327
State?

204
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,327
They don’t do exfil’s.

205
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:33,406
They do now.

206
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:36,147
They wanna run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

207
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:38,207
Engell says, it’s a lose–lose.

208
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:39,637
These people die,

209
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,637
they die badly, publicly.

210
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,347
State wants the blame,

211
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:44,377
we’ll give it to ‘em.

212
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:46,607
What does he want me here for?

213
00:15:46,777 --> 00:15:50,037
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

214
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:57,577
Okay.

215
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:00,867
This is Bob Pender from State OS,

216
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:02,868
he’s been talking
to Morgan, an ex-staff.

217
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:04,868
Thank you.

218
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:06,638
Alright.

219
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:10,548
Mark and Cora Lijek,
twenty-nine and twenty-five,

220
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:13,838
he’s a Consular Officer, she’s
an assistant, newly weds,

221
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:16,728
They uh… only just got
there a couple months ago,

222
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:20,697
No language skills
or in-country knowledge.

223
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:22,097
Henry Lee Schatz,

224
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,437
Agricultural attaché from Idaho,

225
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:26,438
a bit of an oddball apparently,

226
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:30,038
he was there to sell U.S.
tractors to Iranian agro.

227
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:32,239
Joe Stafford, late twenties

228
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:33,349
he’s smart

229
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,439
and a climber, speaks Farsi,

230
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,839
he arranged the hire of his wife,

231
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,898
Kathy.

232
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,239
The Embassy was understaffed,

233
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,239
so the faculty wives
were the typing pool.

234
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,549
And Bob Anders,

235
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:45,928
senior consular officer,
oldest of the group,

236
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:47,699
and most likely to be group leader.

237
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,329
They’ve been hiding at the
Canadian Ambassador’s residence.

238
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:54,748
Fortunately, we do not believe the
Iranians are aware the six have escaped.

239
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:55,549
So…

240
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:59,239
What we’d like for this are bicycles.

241
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:02,730
We’ve identified back roads
from the Chamran district,

242
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,069
couple of rat lines
through the mountains

243
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,639
to the crossing near Tabriz.

244
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,729
Cars are off the table,

245
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,208
because of the road blocks.

246
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,668
We wait until the weather clears up,

247
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:13,040
then deliver the six bikes,

248
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,040
provide them with maps
to the Turkish border.

249
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,549
We have intelligence,
they can ride bicycles

250
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,436
or we’re prepared to send in
somebody to teach ‘em.

251
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,130
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

252
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,040
Tony…

253
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,611
It’s three hundred miles
to the Turkish border.

254
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:38,410
They’d need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

255
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:42,186
We were just asked to sharp shoot this,
State is handling the ops.

256
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:43,981
I’m sorry, who is this?

257
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,730
Tony is an exfil spesh,

258
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,470
he’s got a lot of Shah’s
people out after the fall.

259
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:51,041
Sir, if these people can read or add,

260
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:53,901
pretty soon they’re gonna figure out
they’re six short of a full deck.

261
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:57,009
It’s winter. You can’t afford
to wait around until spring,

262
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,531
so it’s nice enough
to take a bike ride.

263
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:00,531
They only way out
of that city is the airport.

264
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:02,329
You build new cover identities for ‘em,

265
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,502
you send in a Moses, he takes
them out on a commercial flight.

266
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,387
We’ve explored those options.

267
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:09,265
You’re never gonna get them through
airport control, Komiteh own the place.

268
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,780
They could pose as reporters, if the
government issued seventy something…

269
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:13,730
— Seventy four.
— Visas,

270
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:15,552
— for American journalists…
— And the Revolutionary Guards

271
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,131
keep them on seventy four leashes.

272
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:19,132
If they’re caught with
fake journalist creds,

273
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:21,272
it’s Peter and Jane’s head
in a noose in an hour.

274
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:24,071
Look, North America accents
gives us limited options,

275
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:25,675
so we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

276
00:18:25,676 --> 00:18:28,252
What about English teachers
at the international school?

277
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:30,450
It’s a good idea, but that school’s
been closed for eight months.

278
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:33,012
Okay, so how about
’the do-gooders’?

279
00:18:34,702 --> 00:18:36,185
Six Canadians have been over there

280
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:38,583
inspecting crops, ensuring the kids
are getting enough to eat,

281
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,353
we give them creds, makes
them look like ag’ NGOs.

282
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:43,353
It’s a ‘feed the kids’ thing.

283
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:44,241
Okay.

284
00:18:44,242 --> 00:18:45,473
Those kids are black.

285
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,702
Those are African kids.

286
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:49,782
We can get ethnically appropriate kids.

287
00:18:49,783 --> 00:18:51,502
Are there starving kids in Iran?

288
00:18:51,503 --> 00:18:54,043
I’m sure there’s some
skinny kids in Iran.

289
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,848
What about missionary?
— Or… seeds…

290
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:57,403
called… “seeds of hope‟.

291
00:18:57,473 --> 00:19:00,328
Hold on… Sir, do you have
this newspaper in front of you?

292
00:19:00,344 --> 00:19:01,924
Would you mind taking a look at it?

293
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:04,983
What’s in this picture?

294
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:06,301
Tehran.

295
00:19:06,302 --> 00:19:07,674
Right.
What’s on the ground?

296
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,904
— Snow.
— Right.

297
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:15,644
So what crops are the ‘do-gooders’
inspecting under frosting?

298
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:18,134
Sir…

299
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:20,584
Exfils are like abortions.

300
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:22,214
You don’t wanna need one.

301
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:25,104
But when you do,
you don’t do it yourself.

302
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:32,014
You have a better plan?

303
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:34,288
No Sir.

304
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:40,484
<i>What ever the conflicting
signals from Iran today,</i>

305
00:19:40,492 --> 00:19:41,952
<i>for that matter everyday,</i>

306
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,674
<i>about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies,</i>

307
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:49,585
<i>the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demands:</i>

308
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,542
<i>the hostages must be freed.</i>

309
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:52,785
.. to defend human rights,

310
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:54,874
it not only does not defend them,

311
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,614
it violates them for all nations.

312
00:19:57,615 --> 00:20:02,674
We demand extradition of a man
who for more than 37 years,

313
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:05,965
with the United States support,
has killed months old babies

314
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:07,704
in the arms of their mothers.

315
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:11,905
<i>He said that if the Americans try
military force to rescue the hostages,</i>

316
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:15,276
<i>the students will kill them all
and blow up the Embassy.</i>

317
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,768
<i>Americans were outraged
at Iran and anyone Iranian.</i>

318
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:22,706
<i>Before this decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.</i>

319
00:20:22,707 --> 00:20:26,133
<i>An Iranian flag was burned,
while Anti-Iranians demonstrators</i>

320
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,734
<i>gathered near the Iranian
Consulate. The demonstrators—</i>

321
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:32,230
<i>.. also it’s what led to a decision
to scrutinize the bases of the Iranian—</i>

322
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:35,354
They knew exactly what
was going on, they knew it.

323
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:37,924
But I don’t understand wha—
what they should do now,

324
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,597
send them back, just to—
to be tortured and killed?

325
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:42,401
I don’t think that justice
is the worst thing.

326
00:20:42,402 --> 00:20:46,172
<i>When did people first tell you
that torture was going on in Iran?</i>

327
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,722
<i>They would never come to me and say:</i>

328
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:50,476
<i>“Well Sir, we have tortured this fellow‟.</i>

329
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:53,847
<i>.. Sadat of Egypt he calls you Imam,</i>

330
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:57,757
<i>forgive me, his words not mine: A lunatic.</i>

331
00:20:57,907 --> 00:21:00,619
Why didn’t he have a choice,
why do you think he didn’t have a choice?

332
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,475
Because he would have been
referred to as a barbarian.

333
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:03,497
— Please!
— That’s why they’re stating

334
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:05,137
he liked the current regime!

335
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:07,193
The Shah did more for women’s right—

336
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:08,383
I think we’ve better if…

337
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:10,829
Please everyone, get into the coal.

338
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:28,618
<i>.. Get out of here!</i>

339
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,876
<i>At one point the mob
cornered one of Iranians.</i>

340
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:34,138
<i>When he tried to protect
himself, this is what happened.</i>

341
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:36,248
<i>Hit him again!</i>

342
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:38,338
<i>Hit him until he can’t take it anymore!</i>

343
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,338
<i>We’re sick of them!
— Yeah!</i>

344
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:42,559
<i>America!</i>

345
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:44,661
<i>.. even in our little community here,</i>

346
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:47,939
<i>I mean people are drawn
uptight, they’re tense.</i>

347
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:52,109
<i>They shouldn’t even let those
students in that Embassy there.</i>

348
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:55,159
<i>Just shoot a couple of ‘em.
Show ‘em we mean business.</i>

349
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:59,387
<i>Men who served in Vietnam for what
they believed was right are angry.</i>

350
00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:00,449
<i>I’m mad as hell.</i>

351
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:04,244
<i>I’m—I’m like the guy screaming on that
movie program in ‘network’ you know,</i>

352
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:06,694
<i>I’ve had it! And if huh…</i>

353
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,019
<i>if need be I’ll bear arms again!</i>

354
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,989
<i>That’s the way it is,
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.</i>

355
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:17,340
<i>74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.</i>

356
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,739
Hello?

357
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,680
My man!

358
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,050
I’ll get mom.

359
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:30,833
I’m calling for you.

360
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,650
Did you do your homework tonight?

361
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,790
Yeah it was easy.

362
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,789
Excellent.
What are we watching?

363
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:39,213
Battle for the Planet of the Apes.

364
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,420
Tell me, what channel is it on?

365
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,560
Five.

366
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:47,941
Alright.

367
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,312
What did you do at school today?

368
00:22:51,451 --> 00:22:53,051
Nothing, I don’t know.
Nothing.

369
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:57,851
It can’t be nothing.
Something must’ve happened.

370
00:22:57,921 --> 00:22:59,625
After school I’ve traded baseball cards—

371
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:00,879
Hmm–Hmm…

372
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,506
Ok you know those science
fiction, Star Trek, Star Wars,

373
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:23,362
they need an exotic location to shoot,

374
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:25,362
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know…

375
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:27,092
Now image this.

376
00:23:28,422 --> 00:23:32,542
They’re a Canadian film crew on a location
scout for a science fiction movie.

377
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:34,282
We put it out there,

378
00:23:34,452 --> 00:23:36,282
the Canadian producers
put it out there.

379
00:23:36,392 --> 00:23:38,822
They were looking at Egypt, Istanbul.

380
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:43,512
Then we go to the Consulate and say:
’Hey, we want to look in Iran too’.

381
00:23:43,912 --> 00:23:47,223
I fly into Tehran, we all fly
out together as a film crew.

382
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:48,343
Done.

383
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,691
Flamboyant cover identity
should be avoided

384
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:52,397
as it increases operational visibility.

385
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:53,799
This is a lot more
plausible than foreigners

386
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,341
who wanna become teachers in Iran.

387
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:58,051
You want to blend in with the population
you don’t look like a rodeo clown.

388
00:23:58,052 --> 00:24:00,881
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

389
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:02,713
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

390
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:04,191
No Sir, we have a contact in—

391
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,591
— Chambers.
— John Chambers,

392
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:08,018
he’s a Hollywood prosthetics guy, he’s got
an Oscar, he did Planet of the Apes

393
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:10,283
he’s done a bunch of contract
work for us in the past.

394
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:13,023
I go see him, he sets this up.

395
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:15,113
One, two days, make it look real.

396
00:24:30,194 --> 00:24:31,624
I went outside for thirty seconds.

397
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:32,362
Alright?

398
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:34,254
Could you give me a break?
I can’t breath in this house.

399
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:36,313
I need some fresh air,
I can’t—I can’t breath!

400
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:37,562
Stay inside the fucking house!

401
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:38,695
Who saw me go outside, I’m just curious?

402
00:24:38,703 --> 00:24:40,068
— That’s not the point.
— That’s not the point Bob.

403
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:41,566
Doesn’t matter if I saw you
go out or you see me.

404
00:24:41,574 --> 00:24:43,391
— Did you see me go out?
— No! You did go outside…

405
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,239
I did. Okay, I saw you.

406
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:48,484
Bob, it only takes one
second for them to spot you.

407
00:24:53,485 --> 00:24:55,565
Some Americans are missing.

408
00:24:55,965 --> 00:24:57,962
Look at the repaired list
of embassy employees.

409
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:00,315
The numbers don’t match.

410
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,995
Finish assembling the
pictures from the Embassy.

411
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:06,625
All I need is their faces
and I will find them.

412
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:08,485
Yes Sir, it’ll be done.

413
00:25:20,746 --> 00:25:22,366
We want you to go to LA.

414
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:25,546
If you can make the movie thing
credible, we’ll take it to the director.

415
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:27,546
Don’t fuck up.

416
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:30,026
The whole country is watching you.

417
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:32,256
They just don’t know it.

418
00:25:39,826 --> 00:25:41,546
My creation…

419
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:44,056
My creation!

420
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:51,627
What the fuck, Bryan?

421
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:53,257
— Cut!
— We are cutting!

422
00:25:56,717 --> 00:25:57,887
Chambers!

423
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:59,887
John Chambers make up!

424
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:15,257
He says the minotaur prosthetic
is too tight so he can’t act.

425
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:18,367
If he could act, he wouldn’t
be playing a minotaur.

426
00:26:24,568 --> 00:26:25,688
Mr. Chambers…

427
00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:27,688
Kevin Arkins.

428
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:31,058
Hey Tony.

429
00:26:57,169 --> 00:26:58,569
What are you shooting?

430
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:00,569
Monster movie.

431
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:03,949
Yeah? Any good?

432
00:27:04,629 --> 00:27:06,289
Target audience will hate it.

433
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:08,289
Who’s the target audience?

434
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:09,349
People with eyes.

435
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:13,519
Talk to me.

436
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:16,829
It’s an exfil.

437
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:18,089
From where?

438
00:27:19,489 --> 00:27:21,149
Worst place you can think of.

439
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:23,149
Universal Studio.

440
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,030
How are you gonna get in the Embassy?

441
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,290
They’re not in the Embassy.

442
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,600
During the takeover six people escaped.

443
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,600
They’re hiding out in Tehran…

444
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:38,590
and that’s who I’m gonna go get.

445
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:39,893
What am I making?

446
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,010
I need you to help me
make a fake movie.

447
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,370
Well, you’re in the right place.

448
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,119
I wanna setup a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

449
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
— That we’re not gonna make.
— No.

450
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,136
So you wanna come to
Hollywood and act like a big shot,

451
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:54,646
Yeah.

452
00:27:54,654 --> 00:27:56,274
— without actually doing anything.
— No.

453
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,601
You’ll fit right in.

454
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,061
Let’s see.

455
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,430
Well this one has got an M.A. in English,
she should be your screenwriter.

456
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:12,601
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want their free meals.

457
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:14,121
Here’s your director.

458
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:16,691
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

459
00:28:16,692 --> 00:28:19,401
You teach a recess monkey
to be a director in a day.

460
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:22,891
Look if you’re gonna do this,
you gotta do it.

461
00:28:23,091 --> 00:28:25,521
The Kominiacs are fruit loops,
but they got cousins

462
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:28,262
who sell prayer rugs
and A-tracks on Le Brea.

463
00:28:28,862 --> 00:28:32,292
You can’t build cover stories
around a movie that doesn’t exist.

464
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,632
You need a script, you need a producer.

465
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:35,662
Make me a producer.

466
00:28:35,772 --> 00:28:38,602
No. You’re… an
associate producer at best.

467
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:43,152
You’re gonna do a 20 million
dollars Star Wars rip-off.

468
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:46,862
You need somebody who’s a somebody,
to put their name on it.

469
00:28:47,202 --> 00:28:48,862
Somebody respectable…

470
00:28:50,372 --> 00:28:51,292
with credits…

471
00:28:52,632 --> 00:28:55,092
who you can trust
with classified information…

472
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:58,263
who’d produce a fake movie…

473
00:28:59,093 --> 00:29:00,263
for free.

474
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:15,633
Hi, I only got a couple of minutes.

475
00:29:15,663 --> 00:29:17,403
I’m getting a lifetime
achievement award.

476
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:18,723
Mazel tov, Lester.

477
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:22,493
I’d rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog’s balls.

478
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:24,033
Okay.

479
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:27,210
You got six people hiding out
in a town of what… 4 million people,

480
00:29:27,218 --> 00:29:31,064
all of whom chant death to
America’ all the live long day.

481
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:33,034
You want to set up a movie in a week,

482
00:29:33,094 --> 00:29:36,554
you want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living,

483
00:29:36,664 --> 00:29:39,264
then you’re gonna sneak 007 over here,

484
00:29:39,354 --> 00:29:42,804
into a country that wants CIA
blood on their breakfast cereal,

485
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:46,464
and you’re gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

486
00:29:46,664 --> 00:29:49,464
That’s about a hundred militia
at the airport. That’s right.

487
00:29:50,864 --> 00:29:51,924
Right.

488
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:55,664
Look I… I got to tell ya,

489
00:29:55,804 --> 00:29:59,554
we—we did suicide missions in the
Army that had better odds than this.

490
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:01,065
Sir, the car is here.

491
00:30:09,065 --> 00:30:11,635
You ever think, Lester,
this is all for the cameras?

492
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:15,165
Well, they’re getting the ratings,
I’ll say that for them.

493
00:30:27,265 --> 00:30:28,993
We’re going to need a script.

494
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:00,096
I love you.

495
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:12,237
Sahar, how are you doing?

496
00:31:12,957 --> 00:31:14,437
Fine, thank you.

497
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,145
Your friends from Canada, ma’am,

498
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:20,177
all this time, they never go out.

499
00:31:35,378 --> 00:31:36,852
Sahar knows.

500
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:42,728
How about ‘The Horses of Achilles’?

501
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:45,668
Νо gооd. Νоbоdy dоеѕ wеѕtеrnѕ аnymоrе.

502
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:46,958
It’s ancient Troy.

503
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:49,178
If it’s got horses in it,
it’s a western.

504
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,468
Hey, Kenny please?

505
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:53,728
Yeah it’s John Chambers,
about the office space.

506
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:54,868
It doesn’t matter.

507
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,298
It’s a fake movie.

508
00:31:56,408 --> 00:31:59,298
If I’m doing a fake movie,
it’s going to be a fake hit.

509
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:03,838
Cardinal wants all cover options
on his desk Friday morning.

510
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:07,409
Engell’s prepping the bikes option,
teachers option,

511
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:09,839
you have 72 hours to make yours better.

512
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:11,990
Fine.

513
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,360
Hey is 8006 still on the open list?

514
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
Yeah I’ll hold.

515
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,810
Fade in on a starship landing.

516
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,010
An exotic Middle Eastern vibe.

517
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,100
Women gather offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

518
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,330
Argo.

519
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,130
“A Science–Fantasy Adventure.‟

520
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,627
It’s a turnaround, it’s dog shit.

521
00:32:56,635 --> 00:32:59,000
It’s a space movie in the Middle East.
Does it matter if—

522
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,100
Could we get the option?

523
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,070
Why do we need the option?

524
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,070
You’re worried about the Ayatollah?

525
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,070
Try the WGA.

526
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:09,561
Just let me do the talking.

527
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:13,284
I’ve known this guy for 25 years,
he’s full of shit, and he comes on hard,

528
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,211
but uh… I can handle it.

529
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:19,561
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

530
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:21,301
Up like a carny ride.

531
00:33:21,361 --> 00:33:22,381
One month, yeah.

532
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:25,041
— Who are you again?
— Kevin Arkins, Studio 6 Films.

533
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:25,981
He’s the money.

534
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:28,611
Look, what d’you say uh…

535
00:33:28,671 --> 00:33:32,131
fifteen thou’and, let’s close on this?

536
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,471
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

537
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:37,841
No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.

538
00:33:38,412 --> 00:33:38,962
Alright.

539
00:33:40,242 --> 00:33:42,362
I enjoyed your films, the early ones.

540
00:33:42,932 --> 00:33:47,102
I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.

541
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:50,182
Thank you. Very respectful.

542
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:51,812
You’re finished, Lester.

543
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:54,782
Get your cataracts fixed,
read the trades.

544
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:57,902
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

545
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:00,042
They’re screaming for Sci-Fi.

546
00:34:00,732 --> 00:34:03,382
They’re offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

547
00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:07,872
Well… what can I say?

548
00:34:08,732 --> 00:34:10,133
Congratulations.

549
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,503
But see,

550
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,673
it kind of worries me what you
said, let me tell you why.

551
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:20,363
Couple of weeks ago I was sitting
at Trader Vic’s, I was enjoying a Mai Tai,

552
00:34:20,473 --> 00:34:22,183
when my pal, Warren Beatty comes in,

553
00:34:22,303 --> 00:34:24,533
he wishes me well,
we have a little chat.

554
00:34:24,983 --> 00:34:27,783
Seems he was attached
to star in ‘Zulu Empire’,

555
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:30,163
which was just gonna anchor
that MGM slate.

556
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:33,533
But Warren confided in me that
the picture’s gone over budget

557
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:36,613
because the Zulu extras
want to unionize.

558
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:40,814
They may be cannibals, but they want
health and dental so the movie’s kaput!

559
00:34:40,984 --> 00:34:44,364
Which means that the MGM
deal ain’t gonna happen,

560
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:47,564
and your script ain’t worth
a buffalo shit on a nickel!

561
00:34:47,964 --> 00:34:51,644
So, the way it looks to me through
the cataracts I grant you,

562
00:34:51,734 --> 00:34:53,644
is that you can either sign here,

563
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,764
and take 10,000 dollars
for your toilet-paper script,

564
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:58,764
or you can go fuck yourself!

565
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:01,534
With all due respect.

566
00:35:08,364 --> 00:35:09,704
You really know Warren Beatty?

567
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:10,902
Yes I do.

568
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:13,305
I took a leak next to him
once at the Golder Globes.

569
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:15,305
Taco?

570
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:35,415
Got any kids, Lester?

571
00:35:36,615 --> 00:35:38,475
Yeah, I have two daughters.

572
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:41,045
See ‘em much?

573
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,616
I talk to ‘em once a year…

574
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:45,129
maybe.

575
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:46,016
Why is that?

576
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:51,506
I was a terrible father.

577
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:55,246
The bullshit business…

578
00:35:56,046 --> 00:35:58,678
it’s like coal mining, you—you
come home to your wife and kids,

579
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:00,736
you can’t… you can’t wash it off.

580
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:03,276
You?

581
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,118
Yeah I got a son.

582
00:36:07,736 --> 00:36:09,586
He lives in Virgina with his mother.

583
00:36:13,676 --> 00:36:14,737
You’re divorced?

584
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:16,987
Taking time off.

585
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:20,847
He needs to be, you know…

586
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:22,987
where he is.

587
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:26,817
Kids need the mother.

588
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:40,277
They caught the Shah’s chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

589
00:36:41,737 --> 00:36:42,507
Listen,

590
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:46,568
“since the incident, the number
of guards at the airport has doubled,

591
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:50,077
a thorough background examination
should be expected‟.

592
00:36:50,078 --> 00:36:51,679
The movie cover isn’t strong enough yet,

593
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,188
I need another week, Jack.

594
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:54,418
You don’t have it.

595
00:36:57,588 --> 00:36:58,878
We got an office,

596
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:00,568
we got business cards,

597
00:37:01,538 --> 00:37:02,968
we got a poster.

598
00:37:04,278 --> 00:37:07,278
If I’m the Revolutionary Guard, there’s
nothing we couldn’t have made at home.

599
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:09,878
Six people’s lives depend on this.

600
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:12,218
It’s not enough.

601
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:15,248
If we’re gonna fool these people,
it has to be big,

602
00:37:15,388 --> 00:37:17,909
and it has to have something
that says it’s authentic.

603
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,969
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

604
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:25,679
If you want to sell a lie…

605
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:29,309
get the press to sell it for you.

606
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:33,879
No no no, press event, then they’re—
they’re gonna read through the script.

607
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:38,019
I got a bunch of actors who are gonna read
from beginning to end, all the way through.

608
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,169
They have costumes and everything.

609
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:44,109
No, no, no, I can’t, I got, uh,
Variety has the exclusive on that.

610
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:47,450
Any way to make this more uh…
Middle Eastern?

611
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,790
Mesopotamia?
Egypt?

612
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:50,990
Iran.

613
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,710
Look, I can get you in, but you
gotta promise me at least half a page.

614
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,110
No, no, this thing’s an event,
it’s going to be a spectacle.

615
00:38:59,912 --> 00:39:00,682
Lester.

616
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:03,772
Nina, you look fabulous!

617
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:04,992
You doing the reading?

618
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:07,311
I’m playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

619
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:08,742
Great, I’ll call ya.

620
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:13,512
Keep that fucking space
witch away from me.

621
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:14,592
You know her?

622
00:39:14,912 --> 00:39:16,022
I was married to her.

623
00:39:16,142 --> 00:39:18,022
Oh my God, Iraq is amazing!

624
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:19,082
Well, we’re shooting in Iran.

625
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:20,713
Iran with an N?

626
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:22,373
Yeah.
We’re very excited.

627
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:23,853
You ever watch the news?

628
00:39:23,943 --> 00:39:25,853
What does the title refer to?

629
00:39:26,453 --> 00:39:27,853
The Argo!

630
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:28,853
The thing…

631
00:39:29,253 --> 00:39:31,023
Like Jason and the
Golden Fleece, or what?

632
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:33,855
No, no, it’s the ship, it’s the—
the spaceship, it goes…

633
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:36,623
it goes everywhere, it goes all…

634
00:39:37,023 --> 00:39:38,623
…all throughout space.

635
00:39:38,773 --> 00:39:39,973
So it’s the Argonaut?

636
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:41,343
No.

637
00:39:41,543 --> 00:39:42,823
What—what does Argo mean?

638
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:43,913
I don’t know.

639
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:44,973
You don’t know?

640
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:47,683
It means “Argo, fuck yourself‟!

641
00:39:49,108 --> 00:39:51,824
Will you pay me every attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

642
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,369
If our artists could settle in,
we’ll just be ready to begin the reading.

643
00:39:57,467 --> 00:40:01,044
Argo. From Mary Ann Boyd.

644
00:40:01,615 --> 00:40:04,717
Begin on starship…

645
00:40:15,735 --> 00:40:18,924
<i>The people working here are not diplomats.</i>

646
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:21,751
<i>In fact, as the Iman Khomeini said,</i>

647
00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:25,799
<i>they have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.</i>

648
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:30,330
<i>All evidence proves that
these people are spies.</i>

649
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:34,130
<i>In the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful,</i>

650
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:36,940
<i>our message to the waking
peoples of the world,</i>

651
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:40,040
<i>at this time we want to expose
the hateful acts of United States…</i>

652
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,884
Our world has changed,

653
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:46,031
Fires of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.

654
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,813
The ship is turning around.

655
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,583
Fire the thrusters!

656
00:40:49,755 --> 00:40:52,681
He says a gravitational field
that strong will kill any…

657
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:56,943
<i>.. completely unjustified.
They and all others must know</i>

658
00:40:56,944 --> 00:41:00,098
<i>that the United States
of America will not yield</i>

659
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:03,192
<i>to International Terrorism
or to blackmail.</i>

660
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:05,268
Sir, we’ll be crashed.

661
00:41:05,316 --> 00:41:07,606
<i>There’s no enough time to…
— .. are controlled by capitalists,</i>

662
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:09,222
<i>and large oil companies.</i>

663
00:41:09,477 --> 00:41:13,720
<i>The United States government considers
revolutionists as terrorists,</i>

664
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:19,978
<i>but itself and its CIA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.</i>

665
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,968
We’ll find her ship,
we will find our chance.

666
00:41:28,663 --> 00:41:30,598
For the Argo lies my hope,

667
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,874
my hero, my husband.

668
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:36,162
<i>.. We will begin the trials and
carry out the sentences.</i>

669
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:39,911
<i>.. We wonder where and how this apparently
endless parade of hatred will end.</i>

670
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:40,803
EMBASSY BASEMENT JANUARY 23, 1980

671
00:41:40,804 --> 00:41:42,067
EMBASSY BASEMENT JANUARY 23, 1980
What do they want?

672
00:41:42,075 --> 00:41:44,804
<i>They say the question should
be not ‘what’, but ‘who’.</i>

673
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:48,037
<i>The answer to this question is clear,
they want the former Shah,</i>

674
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:51,379
<i>.. They should be ashamed
to talk about human rights.</i>

675
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:53,689
<i>Carter and his government
have given asylum</i>

676
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:55,237
<i>to the worst criminal.
— .. in this compound,</i>

677
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:56,533
<i>for what, for life?</i>

678
00:41:56,752 --> 00:42:00,473
<i>They will remain until
the Shah is returned.</i>

679
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:03,855
<i>But if the exiled Shah,
now in the New York City hospital,</i>

680
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:07,294
<i>leaves the United States
for any place other than Iran,</i>

681
00:42:07,344 --> 00:42:11,005
<i>harsher decisions will be taken
against the hostages.</i>

682
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:18,525
.. We go outside of the ship now,

683
00:42:18,573 --> 00:42:20,717
holding on a single red flower

684
00:42:20,766 --> 00:42:24,635
as it goes to the ruins
of the starship in the desert,

685
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,523
fade to Back. The end.

686
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,166
Here it is. What did I tell you!

687
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:39,259
First shot of the picture.

688
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,011
“Argo, fuck yourself.‟

689
00:42:44,276 --> 00:42:46,070
Argo, fuck yourself.

690
00:43:09,108 --> 00:43:14,559
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
JANUARY 25, 1980

691
00:43:23,682 --> 00:43:24,806
Brace yourself.

692
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,944
It’s like talking to those two
old fucks from The Muppets.

693
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,474
Aliens and robots?

694
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:35,442
Yes, sir.

695
00:43:36,451 --> 00:43:39,537
You’re telling me that there is a movie
company in Hollywood right now,

696
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,862
that is funded by the CIA?

697
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,913
— Yes, sir.

698
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:46,749
What’s wrong with the bikes again?

699
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,478
We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

700
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:51,493
You think… you think this is
more plausible than teachers?

701
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,927
Yes, we do. One, there are no more
foreign teachers in Iran…

702
00:43:54,951 --> 00:43:57,075
And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people,

703
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,090
and everybody knows they
ain’t shootin’ Stalingrad,

704
00:43:59,091 --> 00:44:01,075
with Bob Hope directing
if it would sell tickets.

705
00:44:02,145 --> 00:44:04,102
There are only bad options,

706
00:44:04,616 --> 00:44:06,705
it’s about finding the best one.

707
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:09,067
You don’t have a better
bad idea than this?

708
00:44:09,203 --> 00:44:11,973
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

709
00:44:12,466 --> 00:44:13,586
By far.

710
00:44:21,546 --> 00:44:25,665
The United States Government has just
sanctioned your Science Fiction movie.

711
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,461
Thank you, sir.

712
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,851
I’m required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.

713
00:45:10,772 --> 00:45:12,930
Barely claim me as it is.

714
00:45:14,065 --> 00:45:16,282
Is there any in case of obstacle?

715
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,172
Just Christine.

716
00:45:21,311 --> 00:45:23,519
I should have brought some
books to read in prison.

717
00:45:23,668 --> 00:45:24,602
No.

718
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,331
They’ll kill you long before prison.

719
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:30,929
— Thanks for the ride.
— Yeah.

720
00:45:40,642 --> 00:45:43,247
— Studio 6.
— We got a green light.

721
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:45,550
Keep the office running
until you hear otherwise.

722
00:45:45,647 --> 00:45:48,673
— Argo fuck yourself.
— Argo fuck yourself.

723
00:46:06,537 --> 00:46:08,176
<i>Your attention please,</i>

724
00:46:08,278 --> 00:46:12,227
<i>this is the final calling for
British Airways flight 87.</i>

725
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:47,834
We are a nation of 35 millions,

726
00:46:47,945 --> 00:46:52,566
and many of these people
are looking for to murder them.

727
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,762
Hey.

728
00:46:56,029 --> 00:46:56,802
Hey.

729
00:46:58,343 --> 00:46:59,651
Come to bed.

730
00:47:00,576 --> 00:47:02,360
Another 5 minutes.

731
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,797
She pleaded with me.

732
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:19,496
When it started in the streets
nine months ago, she…

733
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,513
she begged for us to leave.

734
00:47:24,396 --> 00:47:26,832
She packed our bags.

735
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,518
I said, “just—just a little bit longer‟.

736
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:36,324
And all I was thinking was…

737
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,302
“stay…

738
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:41,493
this is good for me.

739
00:47:42,803 --> 00:47:44,094
Stay.

740
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:49,867
Show Newsom you got the balls‟.

741
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:58,056
I can’t believe I put Kathy
in this position.

742
00:48:06,255 --> 00:48:08,603
I think we’re gonna die here.

743
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,782
ISTANBUL, TURKEY
JANUARY 27, 1980

744
00:48:58,036 --> 00:49:02,328
“Iran is a hundred percent not
in a pre-revolutionary state‟.

745
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:05,602
CIA brief, November, 1st, 1979.

746
00:49:05,794 --> 00:49:08,131
Can’t be right all the time.

747
00:49:08,472 --> 00:49:09,809
Kevin?

748
00:49:09,826 --> 00:49:11,461
When did you get back?

749
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:15,743
The Shah escaped on the 747
so laden with gold bars,

750
00:49:15,761 --> 00:49:18,098
that they didn’t make it off the runway.

751
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:19,751
But you kept busy.

752
00:49:19,853 --> 00:49:24,132
Fairing out the torture apparatus
of our friends fallen dictation.

753
00:49:24,941 --> 00:49:26,577
It’s getting worse.

754
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:30,164
Anyone that lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

755
00:49:30,872 --> 00:49:32,798
This strip makes a copy
to the one underneath,

756
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:35,267
passenger keeps yellow,
airport keeps white,

757
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:36,824
when you leave the country,
they match them up

758
00:49:36,825 --> 00:49:39,117
to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.

759
00:49:39,153 --> 00:49:40,515
So if they look,

760
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:43,263
they’ll see I didn’t come into
the country with six people.

761
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:45,538
If they look.

762
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:50,738
When you land, you should go straight
to the Ministry of Culture and…

763
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:53,982
Islamic Guidance, kiss the ring.

764
00:49:54,436 --> 00:49:57,673
Get on record as having
applied for film permit.

765
00:49:57,816 --> 00:50:01,590
If they catch you later, at least they’ll
be confused while they’re torturing you.

766
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:08,319
IRANIAN CONSULATE — TURKEY

767
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:21,887
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

768
00:50:21,942 --> 00:50:25,444
Uh… film production. Business.

769
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:30,371
Why didn’t you get your visa in Canada?

770
00:50:31,584 --> 00:50:35,296
Well, I would have loved to, except my
boss didn’t send a telex until I got here.

771
00:50:35,977 --> 00:50:39,676
If the guy had an intelligent thought
in his head, it would die of loneliness.

772
00:51:00,422 --> 00:51:02,510
The Times and AP found out six escaped.

773
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:06,480
They know who they are, and they know
they’re hiding out with the Canadians.

774
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,677
Somebody withdrew on the family’s talk.

775
00:51:08,703 --> 00:51:09,883
Mother of God.

776
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:12,884
Yeah I just put Vance on a plane to
take the head of eds to a circus,

777
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:15,491
he thinks he can get him
to sit on it for now.

778
00:51:16,924 --> 00:51:18,998
You guy’d better get them.

779
00:51:19,356 --> 00:51:21,190
And get the hell out.

780
00:51:21,532 --> 00:51:24,945
The Captain has informed us
that we’re entering Iranian airspace.

781
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,812
We’ll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.

782
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,244
This film crew is just yourself?

783
00:54:10,352 --> 00:54:13,029
No, we have six more from
Canada meeting us today.

784
00:54:13,165 --> 00:54:15,263
You’d like to film at the bazaar?

785
00:54:15,582 --> 00:54:18,043
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

786
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:19,961
Landmark sites.

787
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:21,574
I see.

788
00:54:22,604 --> 00:54:24,525
The exotic orients.

789
00:54:24,913 --> 00:54:27,728
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

790
00:54:29,097 --> 00:54:31,698
You came to us at a complicated time.

791
00:54:32,255 --> 00:54:35,276
Before the revolution forty percent
of the movie theaters in Tehran

792
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:37,058
were showing pornograph.

793
00:54:37,491 --> 00:54:38,745
I understand.

794
00:54:38,856 --> 00:54:41,867
The function of this
office is purification,

795
00:54:42,185 --> 00:54:45,245
as well as promotion for the arts.

796
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:49,386
I’ll review this for the Ministry.

797
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:52,149
Thank you.

798
00:54:52,172 --> 00:54:54,227
— Salam.
— Salam.

799
00:55:00,134 --> 00:55:02,814
Lester, you’re working late.

800
00:55:02,946 --> 00:55:04,791
Until the dawns early light.

801
00:55:05,111 --> 00:55:09,070
You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.

802
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:13,041
Well, I’m a hundred and fifty years
old, so you wouldn’t be me for long.

803
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:24,221
— Ambassador.
— Ken Taylor.

804
00:55:24,315 --> 00:55:26,177
Thank you for what you’re doing.

805
00:55:26,513 --> 00:55:29,813
I was expecting more of a G-Man look.

806
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,837
I think you’re thinking of the FBI, sir.

807
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,818
Ah. This way.

808
00:55:47,676 --> 00:55:49,931
These are blank—you know, stamps…

809
00:55:50,108 --> 00:55:52,193
Yeah, I’ll take care of this.

810
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:54,883
How long?

811
00:55:55,245 --> 00:55:57,743
A day to prep their covers…
two if they need it.

812
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,448
And—and you’ll fly out with them?

813
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,897
Yeah.

814
00:56:01,412 --> 00:56:03,004
There’s something you should know.

815
00:56:03,317 --> 00:56:06,410
We think our housekeeper’s
figured out who they are.

816
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:11,464
We don’t know if we can trust her.
So, sooner is better.

817
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:02,796
Hi.

818
00:57:02,885 --> 00:57:04,835
Hi. My name’s Kevin Harkins…

819
00:57:05,865 --> 00:57:07,510
and I’m gonna get you home.

820
00:57:08,851 --> 00:57:11,754
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

821
00:57:13,286 --> 00:57:15,562
It’s—it’s theater of the absurd.

822
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,038
What are our chances?

823
00:57:17,146 --> 00:57:18,521
Chances are good.

824
00:57:18,616 --> 00:57:21,763
Good? Well, what’s the uh…
what’s the number value of good?

825
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,829
A thirty percent chance of
being publicly executed?

826
00:57:24,939 --> 00:57:28,087
Can you—can you tell me what the
objection was to normal cover identities?

827
00:57:28,155 --> 00:57:30,302
There are no Canadians in
the country for no reason.

828
00:57:30,383 --> 00:57:31,684
They’ll sniff us out regardless.

829
00:57:31,718 --> 00:57:34,717
The Swedish Consul, they—they accused him
of being an American at the airport,

830
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:35,906
they held him for an hour.

831
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:38,961
We can’t hold upon that, we don’t know
what the hell movie people do.

832
00:57:38,962 --> 00:57:41,039
That’s why I’m here.

833
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:43,969
I’m gonna help you, I’m gonna be
with you the whole way. This is what I do.

834
00:57:44,924 --> 00:57:47,262
Have you gotten people
out this way before?

835
00:57:47,867 --> 00:57:50,051
This would be a first.

836
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:54,146
Do you know that everyday they catch
another friend of the Shah at the airport?

837
00:57:54,172 --> 00:57:56,097
— Joe…
— Kangaroo trials, and—

838
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:59,487
And then firing squads just for having
American names in their phone books.

839
00:57:59,942 --> 00:58:01,385
You’ve been here and hour,

840
00:58:01,642 --> 00:58:04,615
and—and you’re asking us to trust
you with our lives, Mr…

841
00:58:04,697 --> 00:58:06,098
Harkins.

842
00:58:06,353 --> 00:58:08,380
That’s your real name?

843
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:09,759
No.

844
00:58:12,548 --> 00:58:16,386
I know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.

845
00:58:16,905 --> 00:58:19,882
But it is time to go.

846
00:58:20,944 --> 00:58:23,473
We’ve got orders to close
the embassy and go back.

847
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:25,799
There’s nowhere for them to stay.

848
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:29,480
We will never make it through
immigration at the airport.

849
00:58:29,615 --> 00:58:31,130
I’m serious.

850
00:58:31,186 --> 00:58:34,867
I mean no, this is what? The part we say,
this is so crazy it might actually work?

851
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:36,870
— Come on!
— I saw in Burma, they get people out.

852
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:40,005
Snitches and Banana Republic, they get
them over the border after the coup,

853
00:58:40,013 --> 00:58:42,280
pay the guards at the crossing a
hundred bucks to look the other way.

854
00:58:42,296 --> 00:58:44,415
You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.

855
00:58:44,504 --> 00:58:48,398
If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period, that’s execution.

856
00:58:48,414 --> 00:58:49,734
You got a problem lying, Joe?

857
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:51,694
But the point is, we can’t stay here!

858
00:58:51,982 --> 00:58:55,360
If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that.

859
00:58:55,523 --> 00:58:58,468
Pat and I have discussed this,
it’s the risk we took.

860
00:58:59,238 --> 00:59:02,243
That man out there has got bad
cards and he is going to lose,

861
00:59:02,253 --> 00:59:05,234
and if he loses… it’s our lives.

862
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,598
And his life too.

863
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:12,483
Look, we don’t have any alternatives.

864
00:59:12,608 --> 00:59:14,879
We gotta go.

865
00:59:19,943 --> 00:59:23,489
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

866
00:59:23,764 --> 00:59:26,297
What you need to do is memorize
everything that’s inside.

867
00:59:26,423 --> 00:59:30,495
Who you are, what you are, where you’ve
been, complete bio. And then add to that:

868
00:59:30,788 --> 00:59:34,019
where do you vacation, what are you
allergies, who’d you have an affair with.

869
00:59:34,282 --> 00:59:35,534
The only way this works,

870
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:39,090
is if you believe that you’re these people
so much that you’re dream like them.

871
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:42,509
Get started tonight.

872
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:45,525
I’ll be back tomorrow. We’ll get going.
Good luck.

873
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:53,165
Wow, my guy kind of sucks.

874
00:59:53,262 --> 00:59:54,777
What’s your name?

875
00:59:55,172 --> 00:59:57,860
Mike McEwan A.

876
00:59:58,286 --> 00:59:59,606
Sounds convincing.

877
00:59:59,634 --> 01:00:01,725
Kathy, what’s your name?

878
01:00:29,412 --> 01:00:32,397
The Loveboat will be seeing
fifteen minutes from now.

879
01:00:33,848 --> 01:00:36,335
.. insisted that the crisis in Afghanistan

880
01:00:36,346 --> 01:00:40,180
will not divert the attention of the United
States from the plight of the hostages.

881
01:00:40,214 --> 01:00:43,442
.. he seems to be if not impotent,
but at least reluctant…

882
01:00:43,632 --> 01:00:47,066
The United States finds itself
in such bitter confrontation

883
01:00:47,074 --> 01:00:51,198
with the Soviet Union over that
country’s invasion of Afghanistan…

884
01:00:51,505 --> 01:00:53,929
The United States is now
moving towards the decision

885
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:56,431
to boycott the summer
Olympics in Moscow.

886
01:00:57,385 --> 01:01:01,156
Bad new, bad news. Even when
it’s good news, it’s bad news.

887
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:04,873
John Wayne’s in the ground six months,
this is what’s left of America.

888
01:01:33,245 --> 01:01:35,514
The Minister of Culture and Guidance

889
01:01:35,515 --> 01:01:37,046
has approved your location scout.

890
01:01:37,081 --> 01:01:38,575
He will send his representative

891
01:01:38,576 --> 01:01:42,117
to meet you and your crew at the
Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 P.M.

892
01:01:43,044 --> 01:01:44,880
They called your bluff.

893
01:01:45,226 --> 01:01:47,704
— Maybe they’re cooperating.
— Absolutely not.

894
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:52,543
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot, it’s the hive.

895
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:54,171
Seven Canadians, Jack.

896
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:57,557
Never give them opening shots at a cover.

897
01:01:58,196 --> 01:02:00,854
— Are they even ready?
— They’re getting there.

898
01:02:01,091 --> 01:02:03,073
There’s no prize for most improvements.

899
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:03,995
I don’t have a choice.

900
01:02:04,003 --> 01:02:07,097
We say no, they show up at their residence
and drag everyone out at gun point.

901
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,962
How well do you think their
covers are gonna hold up

902
01:02:08,963 --> 01:02:10,933
when they’re getting their
fingernails pulled out?

903
01:02:30,699 --> 01:02:34,904
You want us to go the Grand Bazaar
at three o’clock in the afternoon?

904
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:38,181
You said a day learning our cover
then straight to the airport.

905
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:39,585
— Do they suspect something?

906
01:02:40,008 --> 01:02:43,269
What I know is we need to
pretend to be a movie crew.

907
01:02:43,361 --> 01:02:47,411
We go to the bazaar today, we
fly from the airport tomorrow.

908
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,651
We won’t do it.

909
01:02:52,095 --> 01:02:55,108
He told them that there are six of
us, so then they’re expecting six,

910
01:02:55,126 --> 01:02:56,688
it would be suspicious not
to show up at this point.

911
01:02:56,717 --> 01:02:58,629
Goddammit, guys! What else
do we have to do?!

912
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,457
Alright? What el—what—
what’s the alternative?!

913
01:03:00,465 --> 01:03:02,207
We don’t have to show them
the only cards we’re holding,

914
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:03,505
which is that they
don’t know we’re here!

915
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,947
I get it! That’s the ball game,
okay, we—you know,

916
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:08,565
Look, we don’t have any other…
other choice! What are we gonna do?!

917
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:11,201
Who says that we’ll know
our covers well enough?

918
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:12,764
We’re no in the CIA!

919
01:03:13,883 --> 01:03:15,246
It’s suicide.

920
01:03:15,574 --> 01:03:17,793
I’m asking you to trust me.

921
01:03:18,985 --> 01:03:21,524
I don’t trust you.

922
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:24,268
This is the game, Joe.

923
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:25,506
What world are you living in?

924
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:26,581
What world am I…?

925
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,423
The one where they’re hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob!

926
01:03:29,424 --> 01:03:30,773
It’s too dangerous,

927
01:03:30,812 --> 01:03:33,372
— I don’t want to bring my wife into this.
— Joe, can you stop?

928
01:03:34,452 --> 01:03:35,992
Joe?

929
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:44,193
So, we’ll see you at two.

930
01:04:07,281 --> 01:04:12,617
So, don’t be recognizable, but look
exactly like your passport photo.

931
01:04:13,557 --> 01:04:16,192
I haven’t been this nervous
since our wedding.

932
01:04:17,764 --> 01:04:20,645
Only this isn’t a huge mistake, hopefully.

933
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,647
Like this… Okay.

934
01:04:25,901 --> 01:04:27,449
Hello?

935
01:04:30,064 --> 01:04:31,608
Hello?

936
01:04:32,261 --> 01:04:34,009
Hello?

937
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,781
Who was that?

938
01:04:44,866 --> 01:04:46,801
— Mark?
— Yeah?

939
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:50,277
I’m scared.

940
01:04:52,695 --> 01:04:54,732
It’s okay.

941
01:05:41,492 --> 01:05:42,837
Where are they?

942
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:44,964
In the kitchen.

943
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,338
This is what I do…

944
01:06:03,365 --> 01:06:05,053
I get people out…

945
01:06:06,451 --> 01:06:08,720
and I’ve never left anyone behind.

946
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:13,681
I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

947
01:06:18,414 --> 01:06:20,476
My name is Tony Mendez.

948
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:24,673
I’m from New York, my worked construction,
my mother teaches elementary school,

949
01:06:24,701 --> 01:06:27,312
I have a wife and a ten year old son.

950
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:33,744
You play along with me today, I promise
you I will get you out tomorrow.

951
01:06:38,866 --> 01:06:40,271
Fuck.

952
01:07:49,891 --> 01:07:51,286
Hang on.

953
01:08:39,728 --> 01:08:41,548
You alright?

954
01:08:46,218 --> 01:08:48,653
Okay, tell me who you are?

955
01:08:49,272 --> 01:08:51,437
Mike McEwan, cameraman.

956
01:08:51,767 --> 01:08:54,259
Robert Baker, director.

957
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,095
Timothy Harris, location manager.

958
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:59,294
Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.

959
01:08:59,351 --> 01:09:01,260
Rachel Dewart, production designer.

960
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:03,169
Sean Bissett, associate producer.

961
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,980
Alright, let’s go make the movie.

962
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:20,740
Welcome, welcome,
my name is Reza Borhani.

963
01:09:20,766 --> 01:09:22,122
Kevin Harkins, I’m the producer.

964
01:09:22,194 --> 01:09:25,057
— Nice to meet you.
— This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman,

965
01:09:25,072 --> 01:09:27,510
this is Tim, this is Mary,
our screenwriter,

966
01:09:27,518 --> 01:09:29,114
and this is our director, Bob Baker.

967
01:09:29,115 --> 01:09:30,603
— You are the director?
— Yes.

968
01:09:31,249 --> 01:09:33,617
Is this film a foreign brides film?

969
01:09:34,494 --> 01:09:35,926
I’m sorry?

970
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:39,526
A film where a foreign bride
comes to Iran, but uh…

971
01:09:39,605 --> 01:09:42,849
she doesn’t understand the
language or the customs,

972
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:45,301
and there is misunderstandings and laughs?

973
01:09:45,357 --> 01:09:46,998
Oh, no.

974
01:09:51,758 --> 01:09:56,350
The bazaar in Tehran is one
of the largest in the world.

975
01:09:56,445 --> 01:09:58,109
[Farsi] Izar, salam, choukran.

976
01:09:58,154 --> 01:10:02,429
This Bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.

977
01:10:02,469 --> 01:10:07,971
You can find many items such as
paper, spices, precious metals

978
01:10:08,093 --> 01:10:10,965
All, right here.
Uh, right this way.

979
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,799
[Farsi]

980
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,355
This way.

981
01:10:32,341 --> 01:10:33,886
— Uh, Mike?
— Yeah.

982
01:10:34,114 --> 01:10:35,680
If I was to say that you’re looking
through the wrong end

983
01:10:35,688 --> 01:10:37,931
of that view finder, would I be right?

984
01:10:40,411 --> 01:10:41,827
Yeah.

985
01:10:49,304 --> 01:10:51,021
Just a little bit now.

986
01:11:01,145 --> 01:11:02,810
[Farsi]

987
01:11:02,993 --> 01:11:05,008
[Farsi]

988
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:23,083
Please wait here, let’s uh, stay together.

989
01:11:40,273 --> 01:11:42,065
He wants to know the
photograph you took…

990
01:11:42,118 --> 01:11:45,003
It’s okay, it’s her job to take
photographs. Production design.

991
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:48,552
He says, he did not give you permission
to take photograph of his store.

992
01:11:48,657 --> 01:11:50,654
Well that’s okay, you can
tell him he can have it.

993
01:11:53,596 --> 01:11:55,887
Please, please take that photograph.

994
01:12:04,933 --> 01:12:07,352
— [Farsi] Peace be upon you.
— And upon you sir. Welcome.

995
01:12:07,374 --> 01:12:08,519
I hope you are well.

996
01:12:08,572 --> 01:12:10,574
Thank you very much. How are you?

997
01:12:10,656 --> 01:12:13,083
I’m very well. What’s your name?

998
01:12:13,227 --> 01:12:14,762
Sahar.

999
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:29,032
He’s saying that the Shah killed
his son with an American gun.

1000
01:12:39,289 --> 01:12:41,913
No! Canada! Cana—Canada!

1001
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:44,841
Ι’d lіkе tо ѕuggеѕt thаt
wе аrе еndіng thіѕ vіѕіt!

1002
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:49,656
Let’s go off this now!

1003
01:12:53,615 --> 01:12:55,614
You know, sister, those who are with him,

1004
01:12:55,664 --> 01:12:58,651
Rasool Allah, we are tender with them.

1005
01:12:59,017 --> 01:13:01,012
But stern against the infidels.

1006
01:13:01,104 --> 01:13:03,234
With God’s will.

1007
01:13:04,065 --> 01:13:07,672
But those who sit silently have sinned.

1008
01:13:07,742 --> 01:13:10,377
Yes. Any way I may help, sir?

1009
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:14,137
No, only one thing.

1010
01:13:15,118 --> 01:13:17,678
How long have they been there?

1011
01:13:17,947 --> 01:13:19,592
Sorry?

1012
01:13:20,517 --> 01:13:21,894
The guest of the Ambassador…

1013
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,708
how long have they been here?

1014
01:13:26,327 --> 01:13:28,167
They arrived two days ago.

1015
01:13:28,309 --> 01:13:33,865
Forgive my intrusion,
we must stay vigilant.

1016
01:13:34,905 --> 01:13:37,673
Everyone in this house
is a friend of Iran.

1017
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:13,892
How did it go?

1018
01:14:15,429 --> 01:14:17,997
What about tomorrow?

1019
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:20,737
Tomorrow they’ll be ready.

1020
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:46,407
A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.

1021
01:14:46,644 --> 01:14:50,263
He runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

1022
01:14:50,353 --> 01:14:53,153
The six with the Canadians are coming out.

1023
01:15:03,986 --> 01:15:05,603
Who signed off on this?

1024
01:15:05,691 --> 01:15:07,625
You! Where was your passport issued?

1025
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:09,174
— Vancouver.
— Where were you born?

1026
01:15:09,225 --> 01:15:10,591
— Toronto
— “Torono‟.

1027
01:15:10,615 --> 01:15:11,912
Canadians don’t pronounce the T.

1028
01:15:11,956 --> 01:15:14,532
Some Komiteh guard is
actually gonna know that?

1029
01:15:14,668 --> 01:15:18,246
If you’re detained for questioning they
will bring out someone who knows that, yes.

1030
01:15:18,599 --> 01:15:22,159
Mary, who were the last three
Prime Ministers to Canada?

1031
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,801
Uh… Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.

1032
01:15:24,864 --> 01:15:26,896
— What’s your father’s name?
— Howard.

1033
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,635
— What’s his occupation?
— Fisherman.

1034
01:15:28,722 --> 01:15:31,125
— Where were you born?
— Halifax, Nova Scotia.

1035
01:15:31,155 --> 01:15:32,637
What’s your date of birth?

1036
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:35,351
February 21st, 1952.

1037
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,086
Good. What’s your job on the movie?
— Producer.

1038
01:15:37,094 --> 01:15:39,277
Associate producer. What was
the last movie you produced?

1039
01:15:39,475 --> 01:15:41,153
— “High and Dry‟.
— Who paid for that?

1040
01:15:41,267 --> 01:15:42,701
— CFDC.
— What’s your middle name?

1041
01:15:42,865 --> 01:15:44,844
What’s your middle name?
What’s your middle name?

1042
01:15:44,863 --> 01:15:46,830
— Leon…
— Shoot him! He’s an American spy.

1043
01:15:48,216 --> 01:15:50,515
Look, they’re gonna try
and break you. Okay?

1044
01:15:50,556 --> 01:15:52,047
By trying to get you agitated.

1045
01:15:52,096 --> 01:15:53,977
You have to know your
resume back to front.

1046
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:56,229
Do you really believe your little
story’s gonna make a difference

1047
01:15:56,242 --> 01:15:58,620
when there’s a gun to our heads?

1048
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:03,120
I think my story is the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

1049
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:06,505
That’s right.

1050
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:15,323
Hey. They made it through
the location scout.

1051
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:29,514
You have a call.

1052
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:43,266
— What is it?
— Go to black on green.

1053
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:46,129
Go.

1054
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:47,858
— It all just changed.
— What?

1055
01:16:47,913 --> 01:16:49,720
They’re calling it again,
you gotta come back.

1056
01:16:49,835 --> 01:16:51,243
— What?
— Flight Chiefs are planning

1057
01:16:51,258 --> 01:16:53,409
a military rescue of the hostages,

1058
01:16:53,432 --> 01:16:56,948
Delta Force started training
to storm the grounds. So,

1059
01:16:56,991 --> 01:16:59,695
if the six of them are brought down there,

1060
01:16:59,762 --> 01:17:01,820
they won’t be held for long.

1061
01:17:02,813 --> 01:17:06,406
Goddammit! I never would have exposed them
if I wasn’t authorized to get them out!

1062
01:17:06,446 --> 01:17:09,124
— It’s over, Tony.
— If they stay here, they will be taken.

1063
01:17:09,222 --> 01:17:12,003
— Probably not alive.
— Listen to me!

1064
01:17:12,196 --> 01:17:13,832
The thinking has changed.

1065
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:17,214
Six Americans get pulled out of
the Canadian diplomat’s house

1066
01:17:17,226 --> 01:17:19,730
and executed, it’s a world outrage.

1067
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:23,494
Six Americans get caught
playing movie make–believe

1068
01:17:23,503 --> 01:17:25,953
with the CIA at the airport and executed,

1069
01:17:26,116 --> 01:17:30,910
it’s a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

1070
01:17:33,389 --> 01:17:35,954
We’re responsible for these people.

1071
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:40,364
What we are is required to follow orders.

1072
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:42,086
I’m sorry.

1073
01:17:59,693 --> 01:18:01,239
Come in.

1074
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:05,078
We’re ready to try again.

1075
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:07,437
You’re ready.

1076
01:18:07,603 --> 01:18:09,531
You worked hard.

1077
01:18:09,991 --> 01:18:13,497
Probably the best thing to do
for you right now would be…

1078
01:18:13,664 --> 01:18:15,484
just to relax.

1079
01:18:16,009 --> 01:18:17,444
Okay.

1080
01:18:17,718 --> 01:18:19,221
You did good.

1081
01:18:19,975 --> 01:18:21,482
Thanks.

1082
01:18:47,651 --> 01:18:50,570
So you know.

1083
01:18:50,664 --> 01:18:54,846
Exfil wants you to burn the
passports before you leave.

1084
01:18:56,512 --> 01:18:58,385
If you tell them now, they’ll panic.

1085
01:18:58,404 --> 01:19:00,903
I think it’s best if you just don’t show.

1086
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:05,619
It was always a fucked mission.

1087
01:19:06,093 --> 01:19:08,856
You came closer than anybody else.

1088
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:38,664
It’s off…

1089
01:21:38,677 --> 01:21:40,797
they want us to pack up the office.

1090
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:46,615
This can wait. Let’s go get a drink.

1091
01:22:10,672 --> 01:22:12,703
He’s late.

1092
01:22:26,343 --> 01:22:27,294
O’Donnell.

1093
01:22:27,341 --> 01:22:30,325
Somebody’s responsible
when things happen, Jack.

1094
01:22:31,272 --> 01:22:32,675
I’m responsible.

1095
01:22:33,053 --> 01:22:34,619
I’m taking them through.

1096
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:36,508
Tony?

1097
01:22:45,568 --> 01:22:47,256
Alan! Alan,

1098
01:22:47,282 --> 01:22:50,050
we need to confirm those seven
tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

1099
01:22:50,066 --> 01:22:51,270
Engell shut that down.

1100
01:22:51,316 --> 01:22:52,760
I say it’s back on!

1101
01:22:52,815 --> 01:22:55,024
— I can’t do it, it’s back stopped!
— Wait wait, wait a minute!

1102
01:22:55,565 --> 01:22:57,112
What the hell are you talking
about, back stopped,

1103
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,493
what the hell does that mean?

1104
01:22:58,537 --> 01:23:01,299
Carter’s gotta say yes
for us to get the tickets.

1105
01:23:11,374 --> 01:23:12,774
Time to go.

1106
01:23:23,182 --> 01:23:24,616
Alright.

1107
01:23:25,582 --> 01:23:28,268
— Where’s Engell?
— Uh, he’s in a meeting.

1108
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:30,212
Pull him out.

1109
01:23:31,536 --> 01:23:32,708
Pull him out!

1110
01:23:35,096 --> 01:23:36,984
Thank you. See you soon.

1111
01:23:36,994 --> 01:23:38,398
Sahar’s on the bus.

1112
01:23:38,504 --> 01:23:40,574
— Great.
— Sahar will be fine.

1113
01:23:40,622 --> 01:23:42,796
— Thank you.
— Thank you!

1114
01:23:42,821 --> 01:23:44,197
You two leave right now.

1115
01:23:44,229 --> 01:23:46,024
We’ll leave on the train in half an hour.

1116
01:23:46,064 --> 01:23:47,484
Good.

1117
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:52,423
And he said no.

1118
01:23:52,456 --> 01:23:54,550
This is not a long leisure
and it never has been,

1119
01:23:54,574 --> 01:23:56,407
and you don’t decide if it goes!

1120
01:23:56,826 --> 01:23:58,507
It is going!

1121
01:23:58,706 --> 01:24:00,688
Jack. You are this close.

1122
01:24:00,715 --> 01:24:02,473
Am I? Am I really that close?

1123
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,942
You are this Goddamn close to—

1124
01:24:03,969 --> 01:24:08,273
I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

1125
01:24:08,362 --> 01:24:10,406
You tell the director
to call the White House!

1126
01:24:10,466 --> 01:24:12,228
Do your fucking job!

1127
01:24:20,498 --> 01:24:23,356
— Get to your plane, Claude
— Oui monsieur.

1128
01:24:28,858 --> 01:24:32,602
First time anyone’s gonna ask you
a question is at the first check point.

1129
01:24:32,802 --> 01:24:35,603
The first check point is just to
get a look at your passports.

1130
01:24:35,934 --> 01:24:38,750
Passports came straight from
Ottawa last week. They’re clean.

1131
01:24:39,684 --> 01:24:41,814
You’re gonna find White
House Chief of Staff!

1132
01:24:41,897 --> 01:24:43,160
How would I find him?

1133
01:24:43,288 --> 01:24:46,355
We’re a fucking spy agency! Find him!

1134
01:24:46,891 --> 01:24:50,105
The second check point is immigration.

1135
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,243
You’re each gonna hand them one of these.

1136
01:24:52,328 --> 01:24:55,259
It says that you landed in
the country two days ago.

1137
01:24:55,365 --> 01:24:58,297
They’ll look for the matching
white one, which doesn’t exist.

1138
01:24:58,463 --> 01:25:00,808
You’ll say you don’t know what happened…

1139
01:25:00,834 --> 01:25:03,240
and if you believe they
lost they white set,

1140
01:25:03,507 --> 01:25:05,031
they’ll believe it too.

1141
01:25:05,374 --> 01:25:08,929
Jordan’s in the West Wing,
he’s not taking calls.

1142
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:11,866
Where are his kids?

1143
01:25:11,957 --> 01:25:13,100
What?

1144
01:25:13,179 --> 01:25:15,657
Where do his kids go to school?

1145
01:25:21,932 --> 01:25:23,334
Thank you, thank you.

1146
01:25:23,416 --> 01:25:26,261
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

1147
01:25:29,178 --> 01:25:30,326
White House.

1148
01:25:30,431 --> 01:25:34,581
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace
Academy calling for Mr. Jordan.

1149
01:25:35,128 --> 01:25:37,518
Yeah, I’m afraid it is an emergency.

1150
01:25:37,744 --> 01:25:40,396
Hold for the Chief of Staff’s Office.

1151
01:25:40,547 --> 01:25:42,541
The third check point is the trap.

1152
01:25:42,661 --> 01:25:44,585
It’s manned by the Revolutionary Guard,

1153
01:25:44,648 --> 01:25:47,674
most of them were educated
in the U.S and Europe…

1154
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,814
and all of them are looking for Americans.

1155
01:26:02,986 --> 01:26:04,677
— Hello?
— Jack O’Donnell from CI—

1156
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:05,748
Wait, wait! Who?

1157
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:07,877
Iran Guesthouse operation is ready now,

1158
01:26:07,887 --> 01:26:09,575
if we don’t have the President’s go ahead,

1159
01:26:09,585 --> 01:26:11,116
they are going to be captured.

1160
01:26:12,003 --> 01:26:13,690
David, pick up!

1161
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:33,415
Zurich, it’s under Harkins.

1162
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:44,817
I’m sorry sir, I don’t see
you’d have these reservations.

1163
01:26:47,612 --> 01:26:49,452
Telex for Flash!

1164
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:54,376
Would you mind checking again, please?

1165
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:04,434
Copy D.S., confirm the tickets, go!

1166
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:19,862
My apologies, they just came through.

1167
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:28,416
Swisair says they picked up the tickets.

1168
01:27:28,435 --> 01:27:30,902
Get the L.A. office, tell them
to be ready, in case they call.

1169
01:27:30,984 --> 01:27:33,554
We told them to shut that down.

1170
01:28:04,736 --> 01:28:06,240
There you go.

1171
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:24,800
Not here.

1172
01:29:27,536 --> 01:29:29,713
When did you come through Iran?

1173
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:31,526
Two days ago.

1174
01:29:31,703 --> 01:29:33,752
What was the purpose of your visit?

1175
01:29:34,384 --> 01:29:37,710
We are looking for locations for a film.

1176
01:29:43,873 --> 01:29:45,792
— We have a….
— Oh, yeah,

1177
01:29:45,865 --> 01:29:50,037
I’ve got a letter from
the Ministry of Culture.

1178
01:29:50,754 --> 01:29:53,021
If you want to look at that.

1179
01:30:14,817 --> 01:30:16,315
You can go.

1180
01:30:25,105 --> 01:30:26,538
Come on, come on.

1181
01:30:51,051 --> 01:30:52,366
Passports.

1182
01:30:52,466 --> 01:30:54,256
No passports, no plane.

1183
01:30:58,088 --> 01:30:59,626
Passports.

1184
01:31:04,529 --> 01:31:06,141
Passports.

1185
01:31:15,424 --> 01:31:16,771
[Farsi]

1186
01:31:48,944 --> 01:31:50,246
We’re together yes, uh—

1187
01:31:54,285 --> 01:31:56,648
Pierson’s telling Swissair
they’re not on the plane.

1188
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,006
They should have boarded already.

1189
01:31:58,042 --> 01:31:59,918
Still no answer in L.A.

1190
01:32:24,682 --> 01:32:25,672
Sir.

1191
01:32:34,997 --> 01:32:38,233
[Farsi] Yeah uh, it’s a fantasy story
about a war in another world.

1192
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:40,300
Here you can see our notices.

1193
01:32:40,611 --> 01:32:43,681
See? Argo is filmed in Iran.

1194
01:32:45,412 --> 01:32:46,985
Of course I speak Farsi,

1195
01:32:47,003 --> 01:32:49,466
I wish to make a movie in Iran.

1196
01:33:06,602 --> 01:33:09,031
N—No, I’m… I’m now a writer, and uh…

1197
01:33:10,236 --> 01:33:12,294
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

1198
01:33:12,459 --> 01:33:16,687
These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie,

1199
01:33:16,844 --> 01:33:19,362
Alien villains have taken over
the hero’s planet.

1200
01:33:19,602 --> 01:33:22,630
They fight for their families
and take back the city,

1201
01:33:22,712 --> 01:33:25,741
The villains know he is
the chosen one, so,

1202
01:33:25,812 --> 01:33:29,857
they kidnap his son
in the spice market.

1203
01:33:30,785 --> 01:33:33,032
So he and his wife storm the castle.

1204
01:33:33,297 --> 01:33:36,700
The people—hold that…
the people are inspired to join him.

1205
01:33:36,805 --> 01:33:41,223
They are farmers, but they learn to fight.

1206
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:47,203
They shoot weapons at their enemies.

1207
01:33:49,481 --> 01:33:51,863
And the king of the aliens is destroyed,

1208
01:33:51,864 --> 01:33:53,844
when the people find their courage.

1209
01:34:02,934 --> 01:34:06,323
You don’t go until we verify.

1210
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:11,853
— I understand.
— Sir…

1211
01:34:12,299 --> 01:34:14,084
Call our office.

1212
01:34:14,202 --> 01:34:15,846
They’ll verify.

1213
01:34:40,677 --> 01:34:42,611
.. It goes all the way
throughout the thirties.

1214
01:34:42,643 --> 01:34:43,414
Hold on pal, we’re shooting.

1215
01:34:43,415 --> 01:34:44,791
We’re just going to the
producer’s building.

1216
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:47,275
Yeah I understand, I understand
but we’re shooting.

1217
01:35:21,398 --> 01:35:26,049
<i>Swissair announces final boarding
to flight 3‒6‒3 to Zurich.</i>

1218
01:35:33,234 --> 01:35:35,054
Recess, back to one!

1219
01:35:35,557 --> 01:35:37,286
— Alright, recess.
— We going again!

1220
01:35:37,659 --> 01:35:40,611
Again, everyone!
And… we’re rolling!

1221
01:35:40,641 --> 01:35:43,460
— We’re going to the producer’s building.
— Sorry, we’re rolling

1222
01:36:19,355 --> 01:36:22,161
Sorry pal, we’re gonna be in the movie.
Call my agency.

1223
01:36:22,196 --> 01:36:23,712
Sir!

1224
01:36:35,814 --> 01:36:38,284
Studio 6 Productions.

1225
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:40,896
May I speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?

1226
01:36:41,027 --> 01:36:44,310
I’m sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of
country on a location scout.

1227
01:36:44,318 --> 01:36:46,079
May I take a message?

1228
01:37:02,803 --> 01:37:06,317
Doors are closing for
flight 3‒6‒3 to Zurich.

1229
01:37:15,004 --> 01:37:17,107
— We can go.
— Excellent.

1230
01:37:24,753 --> 01:37:28,089
You can these. It’s a gift.

1231
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:43,269
[Farsi] Wait a moment.
Others are coming.

1232
01:39:59,769 --> 01:40:03,225
Swissair 3‒6‒3, clearance for taxi.

1233
01:40:05,145 --> 01:40:09,680
Swissair 3‒6‒3, you are
number two for departure.

1234
01:40:57,620 --> 01:41:00,854
Swissair 3‒6‒3, you are
cleared for take off.

1235
01:41:04,402 --> 01:41:07,047
Swissair 3‒6‒3,
clear for take off.

1236
01:42:11,998 --> 01:42:15,346
— We got wheels up!
— Wait.

1237
01:42:29,994 --> 01:42:32,313
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce

1238
01:42:32,324 --> 01:42:34,394
that alcoholic beverages
are now available

1239
01:42:34,397 --> 01:42:37,009
as we have cleared Iranian airspace.

1240
01:43:25,228 --> 01:43:26,598
They’re clear.

1241
01:43:27,318 --> 01:43:29,265
Yes! Yes!

1242
01:43:33,762 --> 01:43:35,350
They’re out!

1243
01:43:35,973 --> 01:43:37,740
They’re out. They’re out!

1244
01:43:37,756 --> 01:43:39,576
Yes! We got them out!

1245
01:43:42,205 --> 01:43:43,916
They’re out!

1246
01:43:49,822 --> 01:43:51,989
Great work, boys.

1247
01:43:52,077 --> 01:43:53,748
We’ve managed!

1248
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:07,546
You are admitted to the republic of Iraq.

1249
01:44:52,767 --> 01:44:54,876
We made history today.

1250
01:44:55,709 --> 01:44:59,151
“ History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy‟.

1251
01:44:59,595 --> 01:45:01,492
Or it’s the other way around.

1252
01:45:01,752 --> 01:45:02,956
And who said it?

1253
01:45:03,122 --> 01:45:04,575
Marx.

1254
01:45:05,285 --> 01:45:08,390
Groucho said that?

1255
01:45:10,902 --> 01:45:13,884
Called ‘The Times’ to nail
it to the Goddamn door.

1256
01:45:13,927 --> 01:45:15,285
CIA are the good guys.

1257
01:45:15,297 --> 01:45:17,193
The Canadians are the good guys

1258
01:45:17,497 --> 01:45:19,749
And if we’re not agreeing, them too.

1259
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:24,146
Only. Canada takes the credit, or
they’ll retaliate against the hostages.

1260
01:45:25,201 --> 01:45:27,097
Great Satan wasn’t involved.

1261
01:45:27,872 --> 01:45:29,923
No CIA.

1262
01:45:30,014 --> 01:45:32,040
Is that right, Jack?

1263
01:45:33,807 --> 01:45:35,718
Involved in what?

1264
01:45:36,385 --> 01:45:39,595
We were surprised as anybody.

1265
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:43,695
Thank you, Canada.

1266
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:46,366
We knew that each day
that they stayed there,

1267
01:45:46,367 --> 01:45:48,706
the danger was becoming greater.

1268
01:45:48,802 --> 01:45:52,752
We had been looking for a solution to have
them to leave the country during the past—

1269
01:45:52,779 --> 01:45:56,157
.. Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news…

1270
01:45:56,229 --> 01:45:58,716
.. American department of State
hereby honors

1271
01:45:59,315 --> 01:46:00,971
Joe Stafford…

1272
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:02,987
Kathy Stafford…

1273
01:46:04,518 --> 01:46:06,119
Mark Lijek…

1274
01:46:07,049 --> 01:46:09,857
The Americans will be forever grateful

1275
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:12,098
to our great and ally to the North,

1276
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:14,734
for the protection and safe passage,

1277
01:46:14,832 --> 01:46:16,520
provided to our diplomats.

1278
01:46:16,632 --> 01:46:17,886
Bob Anders…

1279
01:46:18,276 --> 01:46:20,693
Here or anywhere in the world…

1280
01:46:20,789 --> 01:46:22,661
Canada will pay…

1281
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:27,924
for this violation of the
sovereignty of Iran.

1282
01:46:28,049 --> 01:46:32,578
.. ambassador Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.

1283
01:46:36,325 --> 01:46:38,589
So I’m sitting in Jerry’s this morning,

1284
01:46:38,708 --> 01:46:40,343
I’m having breakfast.
Waitress comes over to me,

1285
01:46:40,411 --> 01:46:42,216
she’s waving a newspaper, she says:

1286
01:46:42,266 --> 01:46:44,054
“You see what those Canadians pulled off?

1287
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:46,300
Why can’t we do something like that?‟

1288
01:46:46,429 --> 01:46:48,624
I said to her, do you know what I said?

1289
01:46:48,807 --> 01:46:50,206
No, what?

1290
01:46:50,362 --> 01:46:52,994
“Argo, fuck yourself!‟

1291
01:47:20,964 --> 01:47:22,485
All set.

1292
01:47:22,803 --> 01:47:24,623
Thanks a lot.

1293
01:47:38,583 --> 01:47:41,344
And I left my autograph book at home.

1294
01:47:46,629 --> 01:47:49,964
His eminence called me.
He wants to see you.

1295
01:47:50,221 --> 01:47:52,751
Probably wants to fire me himself.

1296
01:47:53,127 --> 01:47:56,319
He wants to give you
the Intelligence Star.

1297
01:47:56,601 --> 01:47:58,432
You’re getting the highest award of merit

1298
01:47:58,435 --> 01:48:02,115
of the clandestine services
of these United States.

1299
01:48:02,925 --> 01:48:04,847
Ceremony’s on the fourteenth.

1300
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:08,949
If they push it a week I can bring
Ian, that’s his winter break.

1301
01:48:09,839 --> 01:48:14,043
The op was classified. So…
the ceremony’s classified.

1302
01:48:14,129 --> 01:48:17,761
He can’t know about it,
nobody can know about it.

1303
01:48:18,892 --> 01:48:22,739
So they’re just gonna give me an award,
then they’re gonna take it back.

1304
01:48:22,812 --> 01:48:24,549
That’s right.

1305
01:48:25,489 --> 01:48:28,930
If we wanted applause we would
would have joined the circus.

1306
01:48:29,112 --> 01:48:31,806
— I thought we did.
— Yeah.

1307
01:48:32,018 --> 01:48:35,421
Carter said you were a great American.

1308
01:48:35,798 --> 01:48:37,383
Great American what?

1309
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:39,803
He didn’t say.

1310
01:48:52,746 --> 01:48:55,469
What happened to your picture?

1311
01:48:55,704 --> 01:48:57,985
It’s in turn around.

1312
01:49:38,931 --> 01:49:41,311
Can I come in?

1313
01:50:25,425 --> 01:50:27,667
The Iran hostage crisis
ended on January 20, 1981,

1314
01:50:27,969 --> 01:50:30,526
when all remaining
hostages were released.

1315
01:50:31,327 --> 01:50:34,871
They spent 444 days in captivity.

1316
01:50:35,369 --> 01:50:38,478
The involvement of the C.I.A. complemented
efforts of the Canadian embassy

1317
01:50:38,804 --> 01:50:41,803
in freeing the six held in Tehran.

1318
01:50:43,128 --> 01:50:45,808
To this day, this story stands
as an enduring model

1319
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:49,601
for international cooperation
between governments.

1320
01:50:50,324 --> 01:50:53,050
All of the Houseguests returned to U.S.
foreign service

1321
01:50:53,216 --> 01:50:55,926
after their ordeal in Iran.

1322
01:50:57,287 --> 01:50:59,991
Oscar winning make-up artist
John Chambers was awarded

1323
01:51:00,248 --> 01:51:02,896
the C.I.A.’s Intelligence medal,
its highest civilian honor.

1324
01:51:03,507 --> 01:51:06,510
He and Mendez remained friends
until Chamber’s death in 2001.

1325
01:51:07,235 --> 01:51:10,036
Tony Mendez’s Intelligence Star
was returned to him in 1997,

1326
01:51:10,299 --> 01:51:13,799
when operation Argo was declassified
by president Clinton.

1327
01:51:22,641 --> 01:51:26,180
He lives in rural Maryland
with his family.
