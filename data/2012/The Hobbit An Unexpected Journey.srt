1
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,617
<i>My dear Frodo:</i>

2
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,617
<i>You asked me once...</i>

3
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,497
<i>...if I had told you everything
there was to know about my adventures.</i>

4
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,421
<i>And while I can honestly say
I have told you the truth...</i>

5
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,924
<i>...I may not have told you all of it.</i>

6
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,018
<i>I am old now, Frodo.</i>

7
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,272
<i>I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.</i>

8
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:49,069
<i>I think it is time for you to know...</i>

9
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,908
<i>...what really happened.</i>

10
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,872
<i>It began long ago...</i>

11
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,167
<i>...in a land far away to the east...</i>

12
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:06,336
<i>...the like of which you will not find
in the world today.</i>

13
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,897
<i>There was the city of Dale.</i>

14
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,479
<i>Its markets known far and wide.</i>

15
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,987
<i>Full of the bounties of vine and vale.</i>

16
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,649
<i>Peaceful and prosperous.</i>

17
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:36,787
<i>For this city lay before the doors
of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:</i>

18
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,541
<i>Erebor.</i>

19
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:44,047
<i>Stronghold of Thror,
King Under the Mountain.</i>

20
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,005
<i>Mightiest of the Dwarf Lords.</i>

21
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,804
<i>Thror ruled with utter surety...</i>

22
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,385
<i>...never doubting his house would endure...</i>

23
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:57,644
<i>...for his line lay secure
in the lives of his son...</i>

24
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,680
<i>...and grandson.</i>

25
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:04,106
<i>Ah, Frodo. Erebor.</i>

26
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,570
<i>Built deep within the mountain itself...</i>

27
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,403
<i>...the beauty of this
fortress city was legend.</i>

28
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,988
<i>Its wealth lay in the earth...</i>

29
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,909
<i>...in precious gems hewn from rock...</i>

30
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,415
<i>...and in great seams of gold...</i>

31
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,668
<i>...running like rivers through stone.</i>

32
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,708
<i>The skill of the Dwarves was unequaled...</i>

33
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,090
<i>...fashioning objects of great beauty...</i>

34
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:35,508
<i>...out of diamond, emerald,
ruby and sapphire.</i>

35
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,099
<i>Ever they delved deeper,
down into the dark.</i>

36
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,349
<i>And that is where they found it.</i>

37
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,732
<i>The Heart of the Mountain.</i>

38
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,652
<i>The Arkenstone.</i>

39
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,327
<i>Thror named it "The King's Jewel."</i>

40
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:04,332
<i>He took it as a sign,
a sign that his right to rule was divine.</i>

41
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,081
<i>All would pay homage to him.</i>

42
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,627
<i>Even the great Elven King, Thranduil.</i>

43
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,883
<i>But the years of peace and plenty
were not to last.</i>

44
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,099
<i>Slowly the days turned sour...</i>

45
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,848
<i>...and the watchful nights closed in.</i>

46
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,697
<i>Thror's love of gold had grown too fierce.</i>

47
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:41,077
<i>A sickness had begun to grow within him.</i>

48
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,618
<i>It was a sickness of the mind.</i>

49
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,214
<i>And where sickness thrives...</i>

50
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,669
<i>...bad things will follow.</i>

51
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,314
<i>The first they heard
was a noise like a hurricane...</i>

52
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,687
<i>...coming down from the North.</i>

53
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:13,026
<i>The pines on the mountain
creaked and cracked in the hot, dry wind.</i>

54
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,071
Balin, sound the alarm.

55
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,366
Call out the guard. Do it now!

56
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,830
What is it?

57
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,619
Dragon.

58
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,127
Dragon!

59
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,626
<i>He was a firedrake from the North.</i>

60
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,229
<i>Smaug had come.</i>

61
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,885
<i>Such wanton death was dealt that day.</i>

62
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,389
<i>For this city of Men was nothing to Smaug.</i>

63
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,762
<i>His eye was set on another prize.</i>

64
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:36,154
<i>For dragons covet gold
with a dark and fierce desire.</i>

65
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,425
Aah!

66
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,313
No!

67
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,070
Come on.

68
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,945
<i>Erebor was lost.</i>

69
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,498
<i>For a dragon will guard his plunder...</i>

70
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,001
<i>...as long as he lives.</i>

71
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,837
Run for your lives!

72
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,719
Ah! Help us!

73
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:02,199
<i>Thranduil would not risk the lives of his
kin against the wrath of the dragon.</i>

74
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,533
<i>No help came from the Elves that day...</i>

75
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,242
<i>...nor any day since.</i>

76
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,993
<i>Robbed of their homeland...</i>

77
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,538
<i>- -the Dwarves of Erebor
wandered the wilderness...</i>

78
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,008
<i>...a once mighty people brought low.</i>

79
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,805
<i>The young Dwarf prince took work
where he could find it...</i>

80
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,308
<i>...laboring in the villages of Men.</i>

81
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,015
<i>But always he remembered...</i>

82
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,646
<i>...the mountain smoke beneath the moon...</i>

83
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,059
<i>...the trees like torches blazing bright.</i>

84
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,562
<i>For he had seen dragon fire in the sky...</i>

85
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,198
<i>...and a city turned to ash.</i>

86
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,278
<i>And he never forgave...</i>

87
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,571
<i>...and he never forgot.</i>

88
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,544
<i>That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in.</i>

89
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,588
<i>For, quite by chance,
and the will of a Wizard...</i>

90
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:07,548
<i>...fate decided I would become
part of this tale.</i>

91
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,807
<i>It began...</i>

92
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,219
<i>Well, it began as you might expect.</i>

93
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,064
<i>In a hole in the ground...</i>

94
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,771
<i>...there lived a Hobbit.</i>

95
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:26,109
<i>Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.</i>

96
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,444
<i>This was a Hobbit hole.</i>

97
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:33,908
<i>And that means good food, a warm hearth...</i>

98
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,126
<i>...and all the comforts of home.</i>

99
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,454
Thank you.

100
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,744
What's this?

101
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,786
That is private. Keep your sticky paws off.

102
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,413
It's not ready yet.

103
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,127
Not ready for what?

104
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,337
Reading.

105
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,473
What on earth are these?

106
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,567
Replies to the party invitations.

107
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,476
Ah. Good gracious. Is it today?

108
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,015
They all say they're coming.

109
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,020
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses,
who are demanding you ask them in person.

110
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,318
Are they, indeed? Over my dead body.

111
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,201
They'd probably find that quite agreeable.
They seem to think you have tunnels...

112
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,998
- ...overflowing with gold.
- It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.

113
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,783
And it still smells of Troll.

114
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,835
What on earth are you doing?

115
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,048
Taking precautions.

116
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,051
You know, I caught her making off
with the silverware once.

117
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,135
- Who?
- Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

118
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,010
She had all my spoons
stuffed in her pocket. Ha!

119
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,349
Dreadful woman.

120
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:22,057
Make sure you keep an eye on her
after I'm...

121
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,519
When I'm... When I'm...

122
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,025
When you're what?

123
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,994
It's nothing. Nothing.

124
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,711
You know, some people are beginning
to wonder about you, Uncle.

125
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,585
- Huh?
- They think you're becoming odd.

126
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,299
Odd? Oh. Hm.

127
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,751
Unsociable.

128
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,883
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.

129
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,515
Be a good lad and put that on the gate.

130
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,728
- Do you think he'll come?
- Who?

131
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,187
Gandalf.

132
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,820
Oh-ho. He wouldn't miss a chance
to let off his Whizpoppers.

133
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,076
He'll give us quite a show, you'll see.

134
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,404
- Right, then. I'm off.
- Off to where?

135
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,743
East-farthing Woods.
I'm going to surprise him.

136
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:24,207
Well, go on, then.
You don't want to be late.

137
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,547
<i>He doesn't approve of being late. Oh, no.</i>

138
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,962
<i>Not that I ever was.</i>

139
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,098
<i>In those days, I was always on time.</i>

140
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,643
<i>I was entirely respectable.</i>

141
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,514
<i>And nothing unexpected...</i>

142
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,101
<i>...ever happened.</i>

143
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,344
- Good morning.
- What do you mean?

144
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,421
Do you wish me a good morning...

145
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,883
...or do you mean that it is a good morning
whether I want it or not?

146
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,147
Or perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular morning?

147
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,776
Or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good on? Hm?

148
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,146
All of them at once, I suppose.

149
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,899
Hmm.

150
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,991
Can I help you?

151
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,283
That remains to be seen.

152
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,420
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.

153
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,258
An adventure?

154
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,638
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree
would have much interest in adventures.

155
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,895
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.

156
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,015
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.

157
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,776
Mm. Huh.

158
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,937
Hmm.

159
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,065
Oh. Ah.

160
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,403
Good morning.

161
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,528
To think that I should have lived
to be "good morninged"...

162
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:26,700
...by Belladonna Took's son
as if I were selling buttons at the door.

163
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,368
Beg Your pardon?

164
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,209
You've changed, and not entirely
for the better, Bilbo Baggins.

165
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,544
I'm sorry, do I know you?

166
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,755
Well, you know my name,
although you don't remember I belong to it.

167
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,552
I'm Gandalf.

168
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,926
And Gandalf means...

169
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,308
...me.

170
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,677
Gandalf?
Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard...

171
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,892
...who made such excellent fireworks?

172
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,901
Old Took used to have them on
Midsummer's Eve. Heh, heh. Ahem.

173
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,186
No idea you were still in business.

174
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,817
And where else should I be?

175
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,733
Where else...? Ahem.

176
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,456
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember
something about me...

177
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,618
...even if it's only my fireworks.

178
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,753
Yes. Well, that's decided.

179
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,710
It'll be very good for you...

180
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,959
...and most amusing for me.

181
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,753
I shall inform the others.

182
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,261
Inform the who? What?
No. No. No... Wait.

183
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:28,930
We do not want any adventures here,
thank you. Not today. Not...

184
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,895
I suggest you try Over the Hill
or Across the Water.

185
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,687
Good morning.

186
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,820
Dwalin, at your service.

187
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,739
Hm. Uh...

188
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,872
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.

189
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,082
Do we know each other?

190
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,455
No.

191
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,415
Which way, laddie?
Is it down here?

192
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,924
Is what down where?

193
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,171
Supper.

194
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,504
He said there'd be food and lots of it.

195
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,886
He... He said? Who said?

196
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,519
Mmm.

197
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,354
Mmm.

198
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,530
Very good, this. Any more?

199
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,735
What? Oh, yes, yes. Ah.

200
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,074
Help yourself.

201
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:03,216
Hmm. It's just that, um,
I wasn't expecting company.

202
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,634
That'll be the door.

203
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,853
Balin, at your service.

204
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,607
- Good evening.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

205
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,568
- Though I think it might rain later.
- Hm?

206
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,944
Am I late?

207
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,280
Late for what?

208
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,525
Oh! Ha, ha!

209
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,448
Evening, brother.

210
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,914
By my beard...

211
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,076
...you're shorter and
wider than last we met.

212
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,869
Wider, not shorter.

213
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,963
Sharp enough for both of us.

214
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,843
Uh, excuse me? Sorry, I hate to interrupt.

215
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:59,139
But the thing is, I'm not entirely sure
you're in the right house.

216
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,306
Have you eaten?

217
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:05,486
It's not that I don't like visitors.
I like visitors as much as the next Hobbit.

218
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:09,195
But I do like to know them
before they come visiting.

219
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,741
- What is this?
- I don't know.

220
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,824
- I think it's cheese. Gone blue.
- It's riddled with mold.

221
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:18,666
The thing is, I don't know either of you.
Not in the slightest.

222
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,668
I don't mean to be blunt,
but I had to speak my mind.

223
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,837
- I'm sorry.
- You think...?

224
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,084
Apology accepted.

225
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,548
- Ah.
- Now, fill it up, brother, don't stint.

226
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,341
- You wanna get stuck in?
- I could eat again if you insist, brother.

227
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,095
- Fili.
- And Kili.

228
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,097
At your service.

229
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,566
- You must be Mr. Boggins.
- Nope! You can't come in.

230
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,144
- You've come to the wrong house.
- What?

231
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,563
- Has it been canceled?
- No one told us.

232
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,569
- No, nothing's been canceled.
- That's a relief.

233
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,616
Careful with these.
I just had them sharpened.

234
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,617
- It's nice, this place.
- Yeah.

235
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,996
- Did you do it yourself?
- What? No, it's been in the family for years.

236
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,041
That's my mother's glory box.
Can you please not do that?

237
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,835
Fili, Kili. Come on, give us a hand.

238
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,379
Mr. Dwalin. Ha, ha.

239
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,134
Shove this in the hallway.
Otherwise we'll never get everyone in.

240
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,017
"Everyone"? How many more are there?

241
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,220
- Where do you want this?
- Oh, no.

242
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:25,108
- It's really heavy.
- No. No. There's nobody home!

243
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,068
Go away and bother somebody else.

244
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,405
There's far too many Dwarves
in my dining room as it is.

245
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,535
If this is some clot-head's
idea of a joke...

246
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,205
...I can only say it is in very poor taste.

247
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,584
Get off, you big lump!

248
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,503
Gandalf.

249
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,967
Those are my pri...! Excuse me, not my wine.
Put that back. Put that back.

250
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,223
Not the jam, please.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

251
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,134
It's a tad excessive, isn't it?
Have you got a cheese knife?

252
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,271
- "Cheese knife"? He eats it by the block.
- Ugh.

253
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,774
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair...
No, so is that. Take it back, please.

254
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,778
- I cannot hear what you're saying. BILBO:
- It's an antique. Not for sitting on.

255
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:16,694
That is a book, not a coaster.
And put that map down.

256
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,907
- Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf?
- Yes?

257
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,743
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

258
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:26,753
Oh, no, thank you, Dori.
A little red wine for me, I think.

259
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:32,292
- Whoop! Mind out.
- Yes. Ah.

260
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,008
Uh, Fili, Kili. Uh...

261
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,265
Oin, Gloin.

262
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,427
Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur...

263
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,221
- ...Dori, Nori. Ori!
- No. Not my prizewinners, thank you.

264
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,019
No, thank you.

265
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,691
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.

266
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,151
We appear to be one Dwarf short.

267
00:21:55,314 --> 00:22:00,787
He is late, is all. He traveled north
to a meeting of our kin. He will come.

268
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:04,700
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass of red wine,
as requested.

269
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,872
It's got a fruity bouquet.

270
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,374
Oh. Cheers.

271
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,383
Bombur's on his second leg of lamb already.

272
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,130
Hmm.

273
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,051
No chance. Not from that distance.

274
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,385
Wanna bet?

275
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,053
Bombur, catch!

276
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,312
I'll help you with that.

277
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,397
Oh, you great galumphing git!

278
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,696
- Who wants an ale? There you go.
- Over here, brother.

279
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,033
I said have another drink. Here you go.

280
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,535
Ale on the count of three!

281
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,124
One, two...

282
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,334
Up!

283
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,051
I knew you had it in you!

284
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,936
Excuse me, that is a
doily, not a dishcloth.

285
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,142
But it's full of holes.

286
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,436
It's supposed to look like that.
It's crochet.

287
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,564
And a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.

288
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,695
Be bother and confusticate these Dwarves!

289
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,740
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?

290
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,743
What's the matter?
I'm surrounded by Dwarves.

291
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,449
What are they doing here?

292
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:28,416
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering
once you get used to them.

293
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,576
I don't want to get used to them.

294
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,875
Look at the state of my kitchen.
There's mud trod into the carpet.

295
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,460
They've pillaged the pantry.

296
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,050
I won't tell you what they've done
in the bathroom.

297
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:42,008
They've destroyed the plumbing. I don't
understand what they're doing in my house!

298
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:47,434
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but what should I do with my plate?

299
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,854
Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.

300
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,685
Take that back. Excuse me.

301
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,775
That's my mother's West Farthing pottery.

302
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,940
It's over 100 years old!

303
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,829
And can you not do that? You'll blunt them.

304
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,989
Ooh. Do you hear that, lads?

305
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,493
He says we'll blunt the knives.

306

Bilbo.

320
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,678
He is here.

321
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,888
Gandalf.

322
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,525
I thought you said this place
would be easy to find.

323
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,728
I lost my way, twice.

324
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,319
I wouldn't have found it at all
had it not been for that mark on the door.

325
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,360
Mark? There's no mark on that door.
It was painted a week ago.

326
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,871
There is a mark. I put it there myself.

327
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:35,668
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce
the leader of our company:

328
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,211
Thorin Oakenshield.

329
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,872
So...

330
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,334
...this is the Hobbit.

331
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,553
Tell me, Mr. Baggins,
have you done much fighting?

332
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,214
- Pardon me?
- Ax or sword?

333
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,349
What's your weapon of choice?

334
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,053
Well, I do have some skill at conkers,
if you must know...

335
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,814
...but I fail to see why that's relevant.

336
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,816
Thought as much.

337
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,774
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.

338
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,742
What news from the meeting in Ered Luin?
Did they all come?

339
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,908
- Aye. Envoys from all seven kingdoms.
- All of them!

340
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,709
And what did the Dwarves
of the Iron Hills say?

341
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,834
Is Dain with us?

342
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,629
They will not come.

343
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:32,300
They say this quest is ours and ours alone.

344
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,853
You're going on a quest?

345
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:42,902
Bilbo, my dear fellow,
let us have a little more light.

346
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,395
Far to the east...

347
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,524
...over ranges and rivers...

348
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:52,116
...beyond woodlands and wastelands...

349
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,655
...lies a single, solitary peak.

350
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,956
"The Lonely Mountain."

351
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,589
Aye, Oin has read the portents...

352
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,259
...and the portents say it is time.

353
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:12,431
Ravens have been seen flying back
to the mountain, as it was foretold.

354
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,514
"When the birds of yore return to Erebor...

355
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,188
...the reign of the beast will end."

356
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,602
Uh, what beast?

357
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,021
That would be a reference
to Smaug the Terrible...

358
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:31,033
...chiefest and greatest
calamity of our age.

359
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,577
Airborne fire-breather.

360
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,534
Teeth like razors, claws like meat hooks.

361
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,701
- Extremely fond of precious metals.
- Yes, I know what a dragon is.

362
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,501
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.

363
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,584
I'll give him a taste of Dwarfish iron
right up his jacksie!

364
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,207
- Good lad, Ori!
- Sit down.

365
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,380
The task would be difficult enough
with an army behind us...

366
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,674
...but we number just 13.

367
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,802
And not 13 of the best...

368
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,720
...nor brightest.

369
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,136
Here, who are you calling dim?

370
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,849
Sorry, what did he say?

371
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,980
We may be few in number...

372
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,519
...but we're fighters, all of us,
to the last Dwarf.

373
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,063
And you forget,
we have a Wizard in our company.

374
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,028
Gandalf will have killed
hundreds of dragons in his time.

375
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,200
Oh, well, no. I wouldn't say...

376
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,403
- How many, then?
- What?

377
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,868
Well, how many dragons have you killed?

378
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,327
Go on. Give us a number.

379
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,001
Excuse me. Please.

380
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,379
If we have read these signs...

381
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,219
...do you not think others
will have read them too?

382
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,099
Rumors have begun to spread.

383
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,185
The dragon, Smaug,
has not been seen for 60 years.

384
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,068
Eyes look east to the
mountain, assessing...

385
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,239
...wondering, weighing the risk.

386
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,488
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected.

387
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:59,121
Do we sit back while others claim
what is rightfully ours?

388
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,707
Or do we seize this chance
to take back Erebor?

389
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,751
You forget, the Front Gate is sealed.

390
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,299
There is no way into the mountain.

391
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,758
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

392
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,267
How come you by this?

393
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,600
It was given to me by your father.

394
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:27,104
By Thrain. For safekeeping.

395
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,977
It is yours now.

396
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,781
If there is a key...

397
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,413
...there must be a door.

398
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:46,536
These runes speak of a hidden
passage to the Lower Halls.

399
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,833
There's another way in.

400
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,837
Well, if we can find it,
but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

401
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,054
The answer lies hidden somewhere
in this map...

402
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,215
...and I do not have the skill to find it.

403
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,766
But there are others in Middle-earth
who can.

404
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,940
The task I have in mind
will require a great deal of stealth...

405
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,143
...and no small amount of courage.

406
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:17,153
But if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done.

407
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,863
That's why we need a burglar.

408
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,662
Hmm. And a good one too.
An expert, I'd imagine.

409
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,119
And are you?

410
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,036
Am I what?

411
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,955
He said he's an expert. Hey.

412
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:37,344
Me? No. No, no, no. I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

413
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,221
Well, I'm afraid I have to agree
with Mr. Baggins.

414
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,382
He's hardly burglar material.

415
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,638
Nope.

416
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,101
Aye, the Wild is no place for gentle folk who
can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

417
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,144
He's just fine.

418
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:56,946
Enough!

419
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:02,032
If I say Bilbo Baggins is a burglar,
then a burglar he is.

420
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,872
Hobbits are remarkably light on their feet.

421
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:09,285
In fact, they can pass unseen by most,
if they choose.

422
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:13,081
And, while the dragon is accustomed
to the smell of Dwarf...

423
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,341
...the scent of a Hobbit
is all but unknown to him...

424
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,674
...which gives us a distinct advantage.

425
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:24,262
You asked me to find the 14th member of
this company and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.

426
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,519
There's a lot more to him
than appearances suggest.

427
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,521
And he's got a great deal more to offer
than any of you know.

428
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,442
Including himself.

429
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,692
You must trust me on this.

430
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,033
Very well.

431
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,952
- We will do it your way.
- No, no.

432
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,579
- Give him the contract.
- We're in. We're off.

433
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,789
It's just the usual.

434
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,954
Summary of out-of-pocket expenses...

435
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,714
...time required, remuneration...

436
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,754
...funeral arrangements, so forth.

437
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,127
Funeral arrangements?

438
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,426
I cannot guarantee his safety.

439
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,387
Understood.

440
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,394
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

441
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,606
Agreed.

442
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:22,320
"Terms: Cash on delivery, up to but not exceeding
one-fourteenth of total profit, if any."

443
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,401
Hmm. Seems fair.

444
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:28,289
"Present company shall not be liable
for injuries inflicted by...

445
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:33,704
...or sustained as a consequence thereof,
including, but not limited to lacerations...

446
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,793
...evisceration..."

447
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,459
Incineration?

448
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,595
Aye. He'll melt the flesh off your bones
in the blink of an eye.

449
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,766
- You all right, laddie?
- Huh? Yeah.

450
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,856
Feel a bit faint.

451
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,191
- Think furnace with wings.
- Air.

452
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,852
I need air.

453
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,613
Flash of light, searing pain, then poof.

454
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,773
You're nothing more than a pile of ash.

455
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,317
Hmm.

456
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,156
Nope.

457
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,242
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

458
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,170
I'll be all right.
Just let me sit quietly for a moment.

459
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:20,674
You've been sitting
quietly for far too long.

460
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:25,129
Tell me, when did doilies
and your mother's dishes...

461
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,964
...become so important to you?

462
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:32,307
I remember a young Hobbit who was always
running off in search of Elves in the woods.

463
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,685
Who would stay out late,
come home after dark...

464
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,477
...trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.

465
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,021
A young Hobbit who would have liked
nothing better...

466
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:45,654
...than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire.

467
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:50,071
The world is not in your books and maps.

468
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,286
It's out there.

469
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,244
I can't just go running off into the blue.

470
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,584
I am a Baggins of Bag-end.

471
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,878
You are also a Took.

472
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,213
Did you know that your
great-great-great-great-uncle Bullroarer Took...

473
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,008
...was so large, he could
ride a real horse?

474
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,344
- Yes.
- Yes, well, he could.

475
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,389
In the Battle of Green Fields,
he charged the Goblin ranks.

476
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:20,401
He swung his club so hard, it knocked
the Goblin king's head clean off...

477
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,735
...and it sailed 100 yards through the air
and went down a rabbit hole.

478
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,653
And thus, the battle was won.

479
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,444
And the game of golf invented
at the same time.

480
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,791
I do believe you made that up.

481
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,704
Well, all good stories
deserve embellishment.

482
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:45,217
You'll have a tale or two to tell
of your own when you come back.

483
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,181
Can you promise that I will come back?

484
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,635
No.

485
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,891
And if you do...

486
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:00,019
...you will not be the same.

487
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,352
That's what I thought.

488
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,568
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.

489
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,360
You've got the wrong Hobbit.

490
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,412
It appears we have lost our burglar.

491
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,456
Probably for the best.

492
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,001
The odds were always against us.

493
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:30,171
After all, what are we?

494
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,514
Merchants, miners...

495
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,305
...tinkers, toy-makers.

496
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,438
Heh, heh. Hardly the stuff of legend.

497
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,773
There are a few warriors amongst us.

498
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,310
Old warriors.

499
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,855
I would take each and every one
of these Dwarves...

500
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,152
...over an army from the Iron Hills.

501
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:53,281
For when I called upon them,
they answered.

502
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,621
Loyalty, honor...

503
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,828
...a willing heart.

504
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,044
I can ask no more than that.

505
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,793
You don't have to do this.

506
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,833
You have a choice.

507
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,003
You've done honorably by our people.

508
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,636
You have built a new life for us
in the Blue Mountains.

509
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,969
A life of peace and plenty.

510
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:24,775
A life that is worth more than
all the gold in Erebor.

511
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:30,235
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me.

512
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,736
They dreamt of the day when the Dwarves
of Erebor would reclaim their homeland.

513
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,039
There is no choice, Balin.

514
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,038
Not for me.

515
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,085
Then we are with you, laddie.

516
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,384
We will see it done.

527
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,894
Hello?

528
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,193
Yes.

529
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,200
Yes.

530
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,103
Here, Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?

531
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,019
- Can't stop, I'm already late!
- Late for what?

532
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:41,281
I'm going on an adventure!

533
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,244
I said it. Didn't I say it?
Coming here was a waste of time.

534
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,953
That's true enough.

535
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,082
Ridiculous notion. Use a Hobbit?
A Halfling?

536
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,621
Whose idea was it anyway?

537
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,830
Wait!

538
00:40:58,748 --> 00:40:59,795
Wait!

539
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,505
Whoa, whoa.

540
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,422
Whoa, whoa.

541
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,603
I signed it.

542
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,602
Here.

543
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,444
Everything appears to be in order.

544
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,988
Welcome, Master Baggins...

545
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:34,205
...to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

546
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,752
Give him a pony.

547
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,800
No, no, that won't be necessary.

548
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,178
Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.

549
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,885
I've done my fair share of
walking holidays, you know?

550
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,137
Even got as far as Frogmorton once. Aah!

551
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,899
Come on, Nori. Pay up.

552
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,994
- One more.
- Thanks, lad.

553
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,746
What's that about?

554
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:16,460
Oh, they took wagers
on whether or not you'd turn up.

555
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,461
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

556
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,423
And what did you think?

557
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,167
Well...

558
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,808
My dear fellow,
I never doubted you for a second.

559
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,604
It's horse hair. Having a reaction.

560
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,853
No, wait, wait, stop.

561
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,573
Stop! We have to turn around.

562
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,900
What on earth is the matter?

563
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,244
- I forgot my handkerchief.
- Here.

564
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:53,905
Use this.

565
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,835
Move on.

566
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,800
<i>You'll have to manage
without pocket handkerchiefs...</i>

567
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,348
<i>...and a good many other things,
Bilbo Baggins...</i>

568
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,890
<i>...before we reach our journey's end.</i>

569
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:21,900
<i>You were born to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire.</i>

570
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,813
<i>But home is now behind you.</i>

571
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,107
<i>The world is ahead.</i>

572
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:13,193
Hello, girl. Who's a good girl?

573
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,660
It's our little secret, Myrtle.

574
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,791
You must tell no one. Shh, shh.

575
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:26,585
What was that?

576
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,004
Orcs.

577
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:30,710
Orcs?

578
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,344
Throat-cutters.
There'll be dozens of them out there.

579
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,638
The lone-lands are crawling with them.

580
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,679
They strike in the wee small hours
when everyone's asleep.

581
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:44,019
Quick and quiet, no screams.
Just lots of blood.

582
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,234
You think that's funny?

583
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,568
You think a night raid by Orcs is a joke?

584
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,781
We didn't mean anything by it.

585
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,743
No, you didn't.

586
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,370
You know nothing of the world.

587
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:06,246
Don't mind him, laddie.

588
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:11,134
Thorin has more cause than most
to hate Orcs.

589
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,012
After the dragon took
the Lonely Mountain...

590
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:25,020
...King Thror tried to reclaim
the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria.

591
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:30,236
<i>But our enemy had got there first.</i>

592
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:46,581
<i>Moria had been taken by legions of Orcs...</i>

593
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:51,466
<i>...led by the most vile of all their race:</i>

594
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:55,045
<i>Azog the Defiler.</i>

595
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:00,057
<i>The giant Gundabad Orc...</i>

596
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:05,480
...had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin.

597
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,436
He began...

598
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,397
...by beheading the king.

599
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,627
No!

600
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:34,676
Thrain, Thorin's father,
was driven mad by grief.

601
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,462
He went missing. Taken
prisoner or killed...

602
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,223
...we did not know.

603
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,558
We were leaderless.

604
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:46,851
<i>Defeat and death...</i>

605
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,856
<i>...were upon us.</i>

606
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,655
That is when I saw him.

607
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,616
A young Dwarf prince...

608
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,204
<i>...facing down the pale Orc.</i>

609
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:12,046
<i>He stood alone against this terrible foe.</i>

610
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,390
<i>His armor rent...</i>

611
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:27,061
<i>...wielding nothing but an oaken branch
as a shield.</i>

612
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:44,780
<i>Azog the Defiler learned that day...</i>

613
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:49,705
...that the line of Durin
would not be so easily broken.

614
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,188
<i>Our forces rallied...</i>

615
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,908
<i>wand drove the Orcs back.</i>

616
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,074
<i>And our enemy...</i>

617
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,872
<i>...had been defeated.</i>

618
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,710
But there was no feast...

619
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,164
<i>...nor song that night...</i>

620
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:41,131
<i>...for our dead
were beyond the count of grief.</i>

621
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:45,556
<i>We few had survived.</i>

622
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,645
<i>And I thought to myself then...</i>

623
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:02,740
<i>...there is one who I could follow.</i>

624
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,994
There is one...

625
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,746
...I could call king.

626
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,013
And the pale Orc?

627
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,896
What happened to him?

628
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,604
He slunk back into the hole
whence he came.

629
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:41,653
That filth died of his wounds long ago.

630
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,363
Here, Mr. Gandalf, can't you do something
about this deluge?

631
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,410
It is raining, Master Dwarf...

632
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:38,294
...and it will continue to rain
until the rain is done.

633
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,919
If you wish to change the weather of the world,
you should find yourself another Wizard.

634
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,880
- Are there any?
- What?

635
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,671
- Other Wizards.
- There are five of us.

636
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:53,343
The greatest of our order
is Saruman the White.

637
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,020
Then there are the two Blue Wizards...

638
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,724
Do you know,
I've quite forgotten their names.

639
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,108
And who is the fifth?

640
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:06,280
Well, that would be Radagast the Brown.

641
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:10,193
Is he a great Wizard?
Or is he more like you?

642
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:16,954
I think he's a very great Wizard,
in his own way.

643
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:21,750
He's a gentle soul who prefers
the company of animals to others.

644
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,961
He keeps a watchful eye
over the vast forest lands...

645
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,714
<i>...to the east. And a good thing too.</i>

646
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:32,928
<i>For always evil will look to find
a foothold in this world.</i>

647
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,604
Not good. Not good at all.

648
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,325
Eww.

649
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:09,093
Oh, no. Sebastian.

650
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,843
Good gracious.

651
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,782
Come on.

652
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:39,039
Move back! Give him some air,
for goodness sake.

653
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,630
There. There.

654
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,634
I don't understand why it's not working.

655
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:57,266
It's not as if it's witchcraft.

656
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,558
Witchcraft.

657
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:07,735
Oh, but it is.

658
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:14,322
A dark and powerful magic.

659
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:50,667
Where on this good earth
did those foul creatures come from?

660
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,588
The old fortress?

661
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,381
Show me.

662
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,704
We'll camp here for the night.

663
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:36,584
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies.
Make sure you stay with them.

664
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,884
A farmer and his family used to live here.

665
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,845
- Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going.
- Aye.

666
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,054
Right you are.

667
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:48,847
I think it would be wiser to move on.

668
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:52,726
We could make for the Hidden Valley.

669
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,893
I have told you already...

670
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,937
...I will not go near that place.

671
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,402
Why not? The Elves could help us.

672
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,659
We could get food, rest, advice.

673
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,907
I do not need their advice.

674
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:08,161
We have a map that we cannot read.
Lord Elrond could help us.

675
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,700
Help?

676
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,829
A dragon attacks Erebor.

677
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,248
What help came from the Elves?

678
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,254
Orcs plunder Moria...

679
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,840
...desecrate our sacred halls.

680
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,882
The Elves looked on and did nothing.

681
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:28,932
And you ask me to seek out the very people
who betrayed my grandfather.

682
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,391
Who betrayed my father.

683
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,352
You are neither of them.

684
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,727
I did not give you that map and key
for you to hold onto the past.

685
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,942
I did not know that they
were yours to keep.

686
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:47,871
Everything all right?
Gandalf, where are you going?

687
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:51,455
To seek the company of the
only one around here who's got any sense.

688
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:54,291
- And who's that?
- Myself, Mr. Baggins.

689
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:57,248
I've had enough of Dwarves for one day.

690
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,130
Come on, Bombur, we're hungry.

691
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,921
Is he coming back?

692
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,635
He's been a long time.

693
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,140
- Who?
- Gandalf.

694
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,434
He's a Wizard. He does as he chooses.

695
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,688
Here, do us a favor. Take this to the lads.

696
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,814
Stop it. You've had plenty.

697
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,607
Aye, it's not a bad stew, Bombur.
I've had worse.

698
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,821
Dori could've cooked it. Ha-ha-ha.

699
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,240
Hilarious.

700
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,252
What's the matter?

701
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:43,836
- We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.
- Only we've encountered a slight problem.

702
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,845
We had 16.

703
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,845
Now there's 14.

704
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,479
Daisy and Bungo are missing.

705
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,478
Well, that's not good. Ha, ha.

706
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,268
And that is not good at all.
Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

707
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,358
Uh, no. Let's not worry him.

708
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:05,775
As our official burglar,
we thought you might like to look into it.

709
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:07,318
Well, uh...

710
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:11,989
- Look, something big uprooted these trees.
- That was our thinking.

711
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:16,668
It's something very big
and possibly quite dangerous.

712
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:18,583
Hey.

713
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,664
There's a light.

714
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,753
Over here.

715
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,294
Stay down.

716
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,180
What is it?

717
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,765
Trolls.

718
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,072
Oh.

719
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,673
He's got Myrtle and Minty.

720
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,503
I think they're gonna eat them.
We have to do something.

721
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,509
Yes, you should.

722
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:13,767
Mountain Trolls are slow and stupid,
and you're so small, they'll never see you.

723
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,935
It's perfectly safe. We'll be behind you.

724
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,724
If you run into trouble, hoot twice
like a barn owl and once like a brown owl.

725
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,860
Twice like a barn owl.
No, twice like a brown... Once like a...

726
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,983
Like a... Are you sure this is a good idea?

727
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,402
Mutton yesterday, mutton today...

728
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:32,035
...and, blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrow.

729
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,113
Quit your griping.

730
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:39,577
These ain't sheep. These is fresh nags.

731
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:45,091
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have.
Not enough fat on them.

732
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,592
Well, it's better than leathery old farmer.

733
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:52,131
All skin and bone, he was. I'm still
picking bits of him out of me teeth.

734
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:56,594
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.

735
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,725
Might improve the flavor.

736
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,436
Ah. There's more where that came from.

737
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,937
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Ow!

738
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,772
Sit down!

739
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:21,126
Well, I hope you're gonna gut these nags.

740
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,003
I don't like the stinky parts.

741
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,131
- Ow!
- I said sit down.

742
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,337
I'm starving!

743
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,595
Now, are we having horse tonight or what?

744
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:35,803
Shut your cakehole.
You'll eat what I give you.

745
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:40,350
How come he's the cook?
Everything tastes the same.

746
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,139
Everything tastes like chicken.

747
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,477
Except the chicken.

748
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,025
What tastes like fish!

749
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:48,487
I'm just saying,
a little appreciation would be nice.

750
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:54,611
Oh. "Thank you very much, Bert.
Lovely stew, Bert."

751
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,743
- How hard is that?
- Shh. Shh, shh. Shh.

752
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,996
Just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

753
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,041
Here, that's my grog.

754
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,668
Sorry. Ow!

755
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:16,799
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is.

756
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,348
Wrap your laughing gear around that, eh?

757
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,345
Good, isn't it?

758
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,855
That's why I'm the cook.

759
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:38,829
Oh, my guts are grumbling.
I got to snaffle something.

760
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:41,740
- Flesh, I need flesh.
- Ah! Ah!

761
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,244
Blimey!

762
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,916
Bert. Bert!
Look what's come out of me hooter.

763
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,209
It's got arms and legs and everything.

764
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,010
What is it?

765
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,843
I don't know. But I don't like
the way it wriggles around.

766
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:04,062
What are you, then? An oversized squirrel?

767
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,939
I'm a burglar... Uh, Hobbit.

768
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:08,191
A burglar Hobbit?

769
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,977
Can we cook him?

770
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,695
We can try.

771
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,576
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful.

772
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,533
Not when he's skinned and boned.

773
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,707
Perhaps there's more burglar Hobbits
around these parts.

774
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,869
Might be enough for a pie.

775
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,128
- Grab him!
- He's too quick.

776
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,629
Right. Come here, you little...

777
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,008
Gotcha.

778
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,967
Are there any more of you little fellas
hiding where you shouldn't?

779
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,764
No.

780
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:41,300
He's lying.

781
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:45,854
- No, I'm not!
- Hold his toes over the fire.

782
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:48,728
Make him squeal!

783
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,235
Drop him!

784
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:54,817
You what?

785
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,073
I said...

786
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:58,404
...drop him.

787
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:25,094
Get the sacks! Stick them in the sacks!

788
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,792
Ow!

789
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,565
Come on! Get up!

790
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,150
- Bilbo!
- Don't!

791
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,775
Lay down your arms...

792
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,240
...or we'll rip his off.

793
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,877
Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!

794
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,671
Don't bother cooking them.

795
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:47,092
Let's just sit on them
and squash them into jelly.

796
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:51,434
They should be sautéed and grilled
with a sprinkle of sage.

797
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,140
Is this really necessary?

798
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:55,100
That does sound quite nice.

799
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,735
- Untie me, mister.
- Eat someone your own size.

800
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,359
Never mind the seasoning.

801
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,274
We ain't got all night.

802
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:05,827
Dawn ain't far away.
Let's get a move on.

803
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:08,413
I don't fancy being turned to stone.

804
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,459
Wait!

805
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:15,621
You are making a terrible mistake.

806
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,040
You can't reason with them.
They're half-wits!

807
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,300
Half-wits? What does that make us?

808
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,716
I meant with the seasoning.

809
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,639
What about the seasoning?

810
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,092
Well, have you smelt them?

811
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:31,975
You're gonna need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot up.

812
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:35,232
- Traitor!
- What do you know about cooking Dwarf?

813
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:36,854
Shut up.

814
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:40,858
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk.

815
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,695
The secret to cooking Dwarf is...

816
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,953
- Yes? Come on. Tell us the secret.
- It's, uh...

817
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,201
Yes, I'm telling you. The secret is...

818
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,492
...to skin them first.

819
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,627
What? Skin us?

820
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,293
Tom, get me filleting knife.

821
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,129
I'll skin you, you little...!

822
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,168
I won't forget that. I won't forget it.

823
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,632
What a load of rubbish.

824
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,761
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.

825
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,301
Scarf them, I say, boots and all.

826
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,224
He's right.

827
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:17,019
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf.

828
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,940
Nice and crunchy.

829
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,819
Oh, not that one. He's infected.

830
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,733
- Huh?
- You what?

831
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,996
Yeah, he's got worms in his tubes.

832
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,164
- Eww!
- Aah!

833
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,660
In fact, they all have.
They're infested with parasites.

834
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,830
It's a terrible business.
I wouldn't risk it. I really wouldn't.

835
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,873
Parasites? Did he say "parasites"?

836
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,839
We don't have parasites.
You have parasites!

837
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,511
What are you talking about, laddie?

838
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:52,926
I've got parasites as big as my arm.

839
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,686
Mine are the biggest parasites.
I've got huge parasites.

840
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,190
- We're riddled.
- Yes, I'm riddled.

841
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,646
Yes, we are, badly.

842
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,687
What would you have us do, then?

843
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,355
Let them all go?

844
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:09,067
- Well...
- You think I don't know what you're up to?

845
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:13,622
This little ferret is taking us for fools.

846
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:15,619
- Ferret?
- Fools?

847
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,706
The dawn will take you all.

848
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,754
- Who's that?
- No idea.

849
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:23,085
Can we eat him too?

850
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,781
Get your foot out of my back.

851
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,037
Ah.

852
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:03,459
Where did you go to, if I may ask?

853
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,298
To look ahead.

854
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:08,467
- What brought you back?
- Looking behind.

855
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,712
Nasty business.

856
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:12,380
Still, they're all in one piece.

857
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,049
No thanks to your burglar.

858
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,594
He had the nous to play for time.

859
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,390
None of the rest of you thought of that.

860
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,398
They must have come down
from the Ettenmoors.

861
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:29,314
Since when do Mountain Trolls
venture this far south?

862
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,616
Ooh. Not for an age.

863
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,779
Not since a darker power ruled these lands.

864
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:45,254
They could not have moved in daylight.

865
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,166
There must be a cave nearby.

866
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,099
Oh, what's that stench?

867
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:04,436
It's a Troll-hoard.

868
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,356
Be careful what you touch.

869
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,917
Seems a shame
just to leave it lying around.

870
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:26,955
- Anyone could take it.
- Agreed.

871
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,794
- Nori.
- Yeah?

872
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,333
Get a shovel.

873
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,648
These swords were not made by any Troll.

874
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:59,871
Nor were they made
by any smith among Men.

875
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,665
These were forged in Gondolin...

876
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:10,332
...by the High Elves of the First Age.

877
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:13,051
You could not wish for a finer blade.

878
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,854
- Set it down.
- That's good.

879
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,482
All right, come on. Quick.

880
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,493
We're making a long-term deposit.

881
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:44,715
Let's get out of this foul place.

882
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,785
Come on, let's go.

883
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,961
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

884
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,149
- Bilbo.
- Hmm?

885
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,643
Here.

886
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:15,401
This is about your size.

887
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:22,445
I can't take this.

888
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,788
The blade is of Elvish make...

889
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:29,961
...which means it will glow blue
when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

890
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,464
I have never used a sword in my life.

891
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,591
And I hope you never have to.

892
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,215
But if you do, remember this:

893
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:44,931
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...

894
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,812
...but when to spare one.

895
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,689
Something's coming!

896
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,980
- Gandalf.
- Stay together!

897
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:01,193
Hurry now! Arm yourselves!

898
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:22,380
Thieves! Fire! Murder!

899
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:25,925
Radagast.

900
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,344
It's Radagast the Brown.

901
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:30,180
Well...

902
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,146
What on earth are you doing here?

903
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,855
I was looking for you, Gandalf.

904
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,395
Something’s wrong.

905
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:39,690
Something’s terribly wrong.

906
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,028
Yes?

907
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:44,778
Oh.

908
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,410
Just give me a minute.

909
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:51,626
Oh. I had a thought and now I've lost it.

910
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:55,212
It was right there on the tip of my tongue.

911
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:58,917
Oh. It's not a thought at all.

912
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,214
It's a silly old...

913
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,929
...stick insect.

914
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:11,597
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.

915
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:14,224
A darkness has fallen over it.

916
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:16,434
Nothing grows anymore.

917
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,899
At least, nothing good.

918
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,735
The air is foul with decay.

919
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:23,696
But worse are the webs.

920
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,028
Webs? What do you mean?

921
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,287
Spiders, Gandalf.

922
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:29,909
Giant ones.

923
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:34,418
Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant,
or I am not a Wizard.

924
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,792
I followed their trail.

925
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:39,798
They came from Dol Guldur.

926
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,422
Huh?

927
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,754
Dol Guldur?

928
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:48,141
But the old fortress is abandoned.

929
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,760
No, Gandalf.

930
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:54,096
'Tis not.

931
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:05,112
<i>A dark power dwells in there...</i>

932
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:08,991
<i>...such as I have never felt before.</i>

933
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:14,830
<i>It is the shadow of an ancient horror.</i>

934
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:24,302
<i>One that can summon the spirits...</i>

935
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,092
<i>...of the dead.</i>

936
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,488
<i>I saw him, Gandalf.</i>

937
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:48,276
<i>From out of the darkness...</i>

938
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:51,822
<i>...a Necromancer has come.</i>

939
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,874
Radagast.

940
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:02,039
Quick! Quick, quick! Quick, quick!

941
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:06,632
Wait for me!

942
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,566
Sorry.

943
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:24,149
Try a little Old Toby.

944
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,858
It'll help settle your nerves.

945
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:30,489
And out.

946
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:42,713
Now, a Necromancer. Are you sure?

947
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:57,845
That is not...

948
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:02,104
...from the world of the living.

949
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:10,821
Was that a wolf?
Are there wolves out there?

950
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,911
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.

951
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,834
Kili! Get your bow!

952
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,593
Warg scouts.

953
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:32,926
- Which means an Orc pack is not far behind.
- Orc pack?

954
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,933
Who did you tell about your quest
beyond your kin?

955
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,935
- No one.
- Who did you tell?

956
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,437
No one, I swear.

957
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,939
What in Durin's name is going on?

958
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:43,270
You are being hunted.

959
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,312
- We have to get out of here.
- We can't. We have no ponies.

960
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:50,440
They bolted.

961
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:51,949
I'll draw them off.

962
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:55,073
These are Gundabad Wargs.
They will outrun you.

963
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:57,159
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.

964
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:01,576
I'd like to see them try.

965
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,420
Come on! Come on!

966
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:14,881
Come and get me! Ha, ha!

967
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,854
Come on.

968
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:54,837
Stay together.

969
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:56,051
Move!

970
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,727
Ori, no! Get back.

971
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,232
All of you, come on. Quick!

972
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,494
Where are you leading us?

973
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:29,098
Move!

974
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,437
Run!

975
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:48,951
There they are!

976
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,917
This way! Quickly!

977
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,677
There's more coming!

978
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,976
Kili! Shoot them!

979
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,314
We're surrounded!

980
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,116
Where's Gandalf?

981
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:23,448
He's abandoned us.

982
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:31,831
Hold your ground!

983
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:42,379
This way, you fools!

984
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,506
Come on, move!

985
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,802
Quickly! All of you!

986
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,354
Come on!

987
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,226
Go, go, go!

988
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:04,860
Eight, nine, 10.

989
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:08,204
Kili! Run!

990
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:49,705
Elves.

991
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:56,499
I cannot see where the pathway leads.
Do we follow it or not?

992
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,580
Follow it, of course.

993
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,965
I think that would be wise.

994
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,297
Come on now, brother.

995
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:04,985
The Valley of Imladris.

996
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:09,444
In the common tongue,
it's known by another name.

997
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,786
Rivendell.

998
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:18,958
Here lies the Last Homely House
East of the Sea.

999
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:22,798
This was your plan all along.

1000
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,380
To seek refuge with our enemy.

1001
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:28,887
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.

1002
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:32,967
The only ill will to be found in this
valley is that which you bring yourself.

1003
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:37,475
You think the Elves will give our quest
their blessing?

1004
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,061
They will try to stop us.

1005
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:44,190
Of course they will. But we have questions
that need to be answered.

1006
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:51,364
If we are to be successful,
this will need to be handled with tact.

1007
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:52,870
And respect.

1008
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:55,573
And no small degree of charm.

1009
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:59,786
<i>Which is why you will leave the talking
to me.</i>

1010
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,010
Mithrandir.

1011
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,263
Ah. Lindir.

1012
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:03,064
Stay sharp.

1013
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,403
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

1014
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,527
My Lord Elrond is not here.

1015
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:12,782
Not here?

1016
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:14,776
Where is he?

1017
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:31,217
Close ranks!

1018
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:58,620
- Gandalf.
- Lord Elrond.

1019
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:19,475
Strange for Orcs to come
so close to our borders.

1020
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:23,638
Something or someone
has drawn them near.

1021
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:26,102
That may have been us.

1022
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:34,489
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.

1023
01:26:34,648 --> 01:26:37,026
I do not believe we have met.

1024
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:40,616
You have your grandfather's bearing.

1025
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:43,248
I knew Thror
when he ruled Under the Mountain.

1026
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:46,710
Indeed? He made no mention of you.

1027
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:00,219
What is he saying?

1028
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:02,851
Does he offer us insult?

1029
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:06,684
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.

1030
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:16,948
Well, in that case, lead on.

1031
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:18,991
Hey. Come on.

1032
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:22,116
Try it. Just a mouthful.

1033
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:23,872
I don't like green food.

1034
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:26,078
Where's the meat?

1035
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,203
Have they got any chips?

1036
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:32,631
Kind of you to invite us.

1037
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,416
Not really dressed for dinner.

1038
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:35,800
Well, you never are.

1039
01:27:56,563 --> 01:28:00,659
This is <i>Orcrist,</i> the Goblin-cleaver.

1040
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:02,444
A famous blade...

1041
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:08,493
...forged by the High Elves of the West,
my kin.

1042
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,626
May it serve you well.

1043
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:13,167
And this is <i>Glamdring...</i>

1044
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:18,631
...the Foehammer.
Sword of the King of Gondolin.

1045
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:21,304
These were made for the Goblin Wars
of the First Age.

1046
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:26,302
I wouldn't bother, laddie. Swords are
named for the great deeds they do in war.

1047
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,763
What are you saying,
my sword hasn't seen battle?

1048
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,272
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.

1049
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,647
More of a letter opener, really.

1050
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:37,149
How did you come by these?

1051
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:40,282
We found them in a Troll-hoard
on the Great East Road...

1052
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:44,369
...shortly before we were
ambushed by Orcs.

1053
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:49,162
And what were you doing
on the Great East Road?

1054
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,327
Our business is no concern of Elves.

1055
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:55,498
For goodness sake, Thorin,
show him the map.

1056
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,624
It is the legacy of my people.

1057
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:01,428
It is mine to protect, as are its secrets.

1058
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:04,135
Save me from the stubbornness
of Dwarves.

1059
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:07,263
Your pride will be your downfall.

1060
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:10,308
You stand in the presence
of one of the few in Middle-earth...

1061
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:14,145
...who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond.

1062
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:22,987
Thorin, no.

1063
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,043
Erebor.

1064
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:39,132
What is your interest in this map?

1065
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:41,885
It's mainly academic.

1066
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:47,345
As you know, this sort of artifact
sometimes contains hidden text.

1067
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:55,520
You still read ancient Dwarvish,
do you not?

1068
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:06,068
Moon runes?

1069
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,861
Of course.

1070
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:10,656
An easy thing to miss.

1071
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,407
Well, in this case, that is true.

1072
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:15,077
Moon runes can only be read
by the light of a moon...

1073
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:19,669
...of the same shape and season
as the day on which they were written.

1074
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,250
Can you read them?

1075
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:29,933
These runes were written
on a Midsummer's Eve...

1076
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:34,312
...by the light of a crescent moon
nearly 200 years ago.

1077
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,812
It would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.

1078
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:40,727
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.

1079
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:44,782
The same moon shines upon us tonight.

1080
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:08,176
"Stand by the gray stone
when the thrush knocks...

1081
01:31:08,338 --> 01:31:13,094
...and the setting sun with the last light
of Durin's Day...

1082
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:17,639
...will shine upon the keyhole."
- Durin's Day?

1083
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:21,276
It is the start of the Dwarves' new year,
when the last moon of autumn...

1084
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:24,313
...and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.

1085
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,356
This is ill news.

1086
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:29,113
Summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

1087
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:30,572
We still have time.

1088
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:33,200
- Time? For what?
- To find the entrance.

1089
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:37,163
We have to be standing in exactly
the right spot at exactly the right time.

1090
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:41,330
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.

1091
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:44,841
So this is your purpose,
to enter the mountain?

1092
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,093
What of it?

1093
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:50,217
There are some
who would not deem it wise.

1094
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:52,887
What do you mean?

1095
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:58,981
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.

1096
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,464
No, you did the same thing.

1097
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:55,927
- It's not like you didn't do it.
- Dori! Here, take that.

1098
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:02,809
Bombur!

1099
01:34:09,018 --> 01:34:13,114
With or without our help, these Dwarves
will march on the mountain.

1100
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:16,197
They're determined to reclaim
their homeland.

1101
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:21,536
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield
feels that he is answerable to anyone.

1102
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:23,416
Nor, for that matter, am I.

1103
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:27,455
It is not me you must answer to.

1104
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,013
Lady Galadriel.

1105
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:43,679
Mithrandir.

1106
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:05,751
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.

1107
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,577
He didn't.

1108
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:09,834
I did.

1109
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:16,340
Ah.

1110
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:19,555
Saruman.

1111
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:24,220
You've been busy of late, my friend.

1112
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,763
Tell me, Gandalf...

1113
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:32,608
...did you think these plans and schemes
of yours would go unnoticed?

1114
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:34,737
Unnoticed?

1115
01:35:35,438 --> 01:35:36,815
No.

1116
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:39,655
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

1117
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:43,071
The dragon has long been on your mind.

1118
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,573
That is true, my lady.

1119
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:48,118
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

1120
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:51,128
But if he should side with the enemy...

1121
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:54,211
...a dragon could be used
to terrible effect.

1122
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:55,917
What enemy?

1123
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:59,470
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.

1124
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:04,385
Sauron is vanquished.
He can never regain his full strength.

1125
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:09,932
Gandalf, for 400 years
we have lived in peace...

1126
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:12,977
...a hard-won, watchful peace.

1127
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:16,105
Are we? Are we at peace?

1128
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:19,616
Trolls have come down
from the mountains.

1129
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:22,243
They are raiding villages,
destroying farms.

1130
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:24,700
Orcs have attacked us on the road.

1131
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:26,698
Hardly a prelude to war.

1132
01:36:26,823 --> 01:36:29,121
Always you must meddle...

1133
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:31,286
...looking for trouble where none exists.

1134
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:33,796
Let him speak.

1135
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:39,674
There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug.

1136
01:36:39,877 --> 01:36:42,380
Something far more powerful.

1137
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:48,513
We can remain blind to it, but it will not
be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

1138
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:51,522
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.

1139
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:54,104
The woodsmen who live there now
call it Mirkwood.

1140
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:56,065
And they say...

1141
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:01,157
Well? Don't stop now.

1142
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:03,660
Tell us what the woodsmen say.

1143
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:07,118
They speak of a Necromancer
living in Dol Guldur.

1144
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,705
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.

1145
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:12,335
That's absurd.

1146
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:15,337
No such power exists in this world.

1147
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:19,592
This Necromancer is nothing more
than a mortal man.

1148
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:22,420
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

1149
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:24,214
And so I thought too.

1150
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:27,805
- But Radagast has seen...
- Radagast?

1151
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:31,354
Do not speak to me
of Radagast the Brown.

1152
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:33,352
He's a foolish fellow.

1153
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:37,777
Well, he's odd, I grant you.
He lives a solitary life.

1154
01:37:37,935 --> 01:37:42,315
It's not that. It's his excessive
consumption of mushrooms.

1155
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:46,862
They've addled his brain
and yellowed his teeth.

1156
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,742
I've warned him.

1157
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:52,208
It is unbefitting one of the Istari
to be wandering the woods...

1158
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:54,995
<i>You carry something.</i>

1159
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:59,132
<i>It came to you from Radagast.</i>

1160
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:02,760
<i>He found it in Dol Guldur.</i>

1161
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,837
<i>Yes.</i>

1162
01:38:05,838 --> 01:38:07,886
<i>Show me.</i>

1163
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:10,556
...Listen to me.

1164
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:14,602
I would think I was talking to myself
for all the attention that he paid.

1165
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:17,108
By all means...

1166
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:20,732
What is that?

1167
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:23,614
A relic of Mordor.

1168
01:38:34,117 --> 01:38:36,085
A Morgul Blade.

1169
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:39,418
Made for the Witchking of Angmar.

1170
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:43,084
And buried with him.

1171
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:46,925
When Angmar fell...

1172
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:50,558
...the Men of the North took his body
and all that he possessed...

1173
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:53,887
...and sealed it within
the High Fells of Rhudaur.

1174
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:57,107
Deep within the rock they buried him...

1175
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:01,023
...in a tomb so dark...

1176
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:02,812
...it would never come to light.

1177
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:05,482
This is not possible.

1178
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:08,860
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs.

1179
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:10,908
They cannot be opened.

1180
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:15,917
What proof do we have this weapon
came from Angmar's grave?

1181
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:19,336
- I have none.
- Because there is none.

1182
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,464
Let us examine what we know.

1183
01:39:23,249 --> 01:39:25,468
A single Orc pack...

1184
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:27,924
...has dared to cross the Bruinen.

1185
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:31,803
A dagger from a bygone age
has been found.

1186
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:37,314
And a human sorcerer who calls himself
"The Necromancer"...

1187
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:41,727
...has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress.

1188
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:46,281
It's not so very much after all.

1189
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:51,491
The question of this Dwarvish company,
however, troubles me deeply.

1190
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,370
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.

1191
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:56,954
I do not feel I can condone such a quest.

1192
01:39:57,450 --> 01:40:01,671
If they'd come to me, I might have
spared them this disappointment.

1193
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:04,966
I do not pretend to understand your reason
for raising their hopes.

1194
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:06,751
<i>They are leaving.</i>

1195
01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:10,800
<i>Yes.</i>

1196
01:40:12,882 --> 01:40:14,509
<i>You knew.</i>

1197
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:22,563
No, I'm afraid there is
nothing else for it.

1198
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,153
My Lord Elrond.

1199
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:29,449
The Dwarves, they're gone.

1200
01:40:34,737 --> 01:40:36,705
Be on your guard.

1201
01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:39,166
We're about to step over
the Edge of the Wild.

1202
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:42,078
Balin, you know these paths. Lead on.

1203
01:40:42,245 --> 01:40:43,838
Aye.

1204
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:51,425
Master Baggins...

1205
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:53,965
...I suggest you keep up.

1206
01:41:07,687 --> 01:41:10,236
- You will follow them.
- Yes.

1207
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:13,568
You are right to help
Thorin Oakenshield.

1208
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:16,954
But I fear this quest has set in motion...

1209
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:20,708
...forces we do not yet understand.

1210
01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:24,746
The riddle of the Morgul Blade
must be answered.

1211
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:28,504
Something moves in the shadows unseen,
hidden from our sight.

1212
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:30,718
It will not show itself.

1213
01:41:30,876 --> 01:41:32,628
Not yet.

1214
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:35,636
But every day it grows in strength.

1215
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,808
You must be careful.

1216
01:41:42,263 --> 01:41:44,015
Mithrandir?

1217
01:41:45,725 --> 01:41:47,819
Why the Halfling?

1218
01:41:49,729 --> 01:41:51,731
I do not know.

1219
01:41:54,275 --> 01:41:58,075
Saruman believes
that it is only great power...

1220
01:41:58,237 --> 01:42:01,411
...that can hold evil in check.

1221
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:04,119
But that is not what I have found.

1222
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:08,965
I have found it is the small things...

1223
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:11,501
...everyday deeds of ordinary folk...

1224
01:42:11,626 --> 01:42:14,846
...that keeps the darkness at bay.

1225
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:18,849
Simple acts of kindness and love.

1226
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,730
Why Bilbo Baggins?

1227
01:42:25,848 --> 01:42:28,522
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid...

1228
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:32,947
...and he gives me courage.

1229
01:42:37,693 --> 01:42:41,038
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.

1230
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:44,200
You are not alone.

1231
01:44:24,425 --> 01:44:27,178
Hey! Hold on!

1232
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,565
- Aah!
- Bilbo!

1233
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:41,109
We must find shelter!

1234
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:42,697
Look out!

1235
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:49,958
Look out, brother!

1236
01:44:50,785 --> 01:44:52,332
Hold on!

1237
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:57,800
This is no thunderstorm.

1238
01:44:58,334 --> 01:45:00,837
It's a thunder-battle!

1239
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:03,388
Look!

1240
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:09,686
Well, bless me.

1241
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:11,685
The legends are true.

1242
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:15,818
Giants! Stone-Giants!

1243
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:24,948
Take cover, you fool!

1244
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:27,618
Hold on!

1245
01:45:35,871 --> 01:45:38,465
- What's happening?
- Grab my hand!

1246
01:46:02,231 --> 01:46:05,201
- Go, go, go!
- Run! Get off! Get off!

1247
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:12,158
- Run!
- Look out!

1248
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:18,626
Look out!

1249
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,569
Jump!

1250
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:41,861
Come on!

1251
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,368
Hold on!

1252
01:46:55,451 --> 01:46:57,624
No!

1253
01:46:57,745 --> 01:46:59,338
No!

1254
01:47:08,088 --> 01:47:10,557
No! Kili!

1255
01:47:16,472 --> 01:47:18,725
It's all right! They're alive!

1256
01:47:20,476 --> 01:47:22,820
Where's Bilbo? Where's the Hobbit?

1257
01:47:24,313 --> 01:47:25,610
There!

1258
01:47:28,567 --> 01:47:29,944
Get him!

1259
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:31,820
Aah!

1260
01:47:32,071 --> 01:47:34,369
- Grab my hand!
- Bilbo!

1261
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:38,168
- Ori, be careful!
- Take it!

1262
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:40,796
- I've got you, lad.
- Grab on! Grab on!

1263
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:53,850
Come on. Get him.

1264
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:55,682
Come on, lad. Up you get.

1265
01:47:58,931 --> 01:48:01,275
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

1266
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:04,270
He's been lost ever since he left home.

1267
01:48:05,145 --> 01:48:06,988
He should never have come.

1268
01:48:07,189 --> 01:48:09,112
He has no place amongst us.

1269
01:48:10,985 --> 01:48:12,783
Dwalin!

1270
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:21,291
- It looks safe enough.
- Search to the back.

1271
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:24,544
Caves in the mountain
are seldom unoccupied.

1272
01:48:28,043 --> 01:48:30,011
There's nothing here.

1273
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,974
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.

1274
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:37,053
No. No fires. Not in this place.

1275
01:48:37,219 --> 01:48:38,937
Get some sleep.

1276
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:41,565
We start at first light.

1277
01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:45,482
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us.

1278
01:48:45,644 --> 01:48:48,614
- That was the plan.
- Plans change.

1279
01:48:48,814 --> 01:48:52,284
Bofur, take the first watch.

1280
01:50:06,642 --> 01:50:08,394
Where do you think you're going?

1281
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:12,819
Back to Rivendell.

1282
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:16,239
No, no, you can't turn back now, eh?

1283
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:19,409
You're part of the company.
You're one of us.

1284
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:21,539
I'm not, though, am I?

1285
01:50:22,908 --> 01:50:26,208
Thorin said I should never have come
and he was right.

1286
01:50:26,411 --> 01:50:30,507
I'm not a Took, I'm a Baggins.
I don't know what I was thinking.

1287
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:35,763
- I should never have run out my door.
- You're homesick. I understand.

1288
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:38,390
No, you don't. You don't understand.
None of you do.

1289
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:41,309
You're Dwarves.
You're used to this life.

1290
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:45,265
To living on the road, never settling
in one place, not belonging anywhere!

1291
01:50:49,393 --> 01:50:50,940
Oh, I am sorry. I didn't...

1292
01:50:56,608 --> 01:50:58,406
No, you're right.

1293
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:03,657
We don't belong anywhere.

1294
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:14,085
I wish you all the luck in the world.

1295
01:51:17,337 --> 01:51:19,055
I really do.

1296
01:51:23,177 --> 01:51:24,554
What's that?

1297
01:51:26,805 --> 01:51:28,148
Hmm?

1298
01:51:47,034 --> 01:51:49,082
Wake up! Wake up!

1299
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:50,416
Whoa!

1300
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:14,778
Look out! Look out!

1301
01:52:18,023 --> 01:52:19,696
Get away!

1302
01:52:23,779 --> 01:52:25,281
Filthy scum!

1303
01:52:25,447 --> 01:52:27,541
Get back!

1304
01:52:31,245 --> 01:52:33,168
You'll pay for this!

1305
01:52:39,503 --> 01:52:41,551
Got you.

1306
01:52:41,797 --> 01:52:44,300
All right, all right. Don't push.

1307
01:52:46,093 --> 01:52:48,937
Get off! Get your hands off me!
Get off me!

1308
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:56,444
Get off me!

1309
01:54:43,418 --> 01:54:48,845
Who would be so bold
as to come armed into my kingdom?

1310
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:52,511
Spies? Thieves? Assassins?

1311
01:54:52,677 --> 01:54:54,395
Dwarves, You r Malevolence.

1312
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:56,272
Dwarves?

1313
01:54:56,431 --> 01:54:58,183
We found them on the Front Porch.

1314
01:54:58,392 --> 01:55:02,738
Well, don't just stand there. Search them.

1315
01:55:02,896 --> 01:55:05,445
Every crack. Every crevice.

1316
01:55:11,029 --> 01:55:13,407
What are you doing in these parts?

1317
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:16,744
Speak!

1318
01:55:18,412 --> 01:55:23,964
Very well. If they will not talk,
we'll make them squawk.

1319
01:55:24,126 --> 01:55:25,628
Bring up the mangler.

1320
01:55:25,794 --> 01:55:28,638
Bring up the bonebreaker.

1321
01:55:28,839 --> 01:55:31,888
- Start with the youngest.
- Wait!

1322
01:55:34,469 --> 01:55:37,769
Well, well, well.

1323
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:40,434
Look who it is.

1324
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:44,688
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...

1325
01:55:45,397 --> 01:55:48,571
...King Under the Mountain.

1326
01:55:49,401 --> 01:55:53,406
Oh, but I'm forgetting.
You don't have a mountain.

1327
01:55:53,572 --> 01:55:55,165
And you're not a king...

1328
01:55:55,365 --> 01:55:59,711
...which makes you nobody, really.

1329
01:56:03,123 --> 01:56:07,970
I know someone who would
pay a pretty price for your head.

1330
01:56:08,837 --> 01:56:10,760
Just a head.

1331
01:56:10,922 --> 01:56:12,640
Nothing attached.

1332
01:56:13,842 --> 01:56:17,517
Perhaps you Know of whom I speak.

1333
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:20,474
An old enemy of yours.

1334
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:27,440
A pale Orc, astride a white Warg.

1335
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:32,199
Azog the Defiler was destroyed.

1336
01:56:34,488 --> 01:56:36,786
He was slain in battle long ago.

1337
01:56:37,032 --> 01:56:40,832
So you think his defiling days are done,
do you?

1338
01:56:42,871 --> 01:56:45,374
Send word to the pale Orc.

1339
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:49,044
Tell him I have found his prize.

1340
01:57:26,081 --> 01:57:27,173
Yes!

1341
01:57:28,917 --> 01:57:30,385
Yes.

1342
01:57:31,419 --> 01:57:34,138
Yes.

1343
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:37,843
Yes!

1344
01:57:38,009 --> 01:57:39,886
Gollum, gollum!

1345
01:58:04,369 --> 01:58:05,746
Aah!

1346
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:11,544
Nasty Goblinses!

1347
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:15,088
Better than old bones, precious.

1348
01:58:15,255 --> 01:58:17,178
Better than nothing.

1349
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:50,341
Too many boneses, precious.
Not enough flesh!

1350
01:58:50,498 --> 01:58:54,128
Shut up! Cut its skin off.

1351
01:58:55,045 --> 01:58:57,389
Start with its head.

1352
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:06,015
<i>♪ The cold hard lands ♪

1353
01:59:06,181 --> 01:59:09,526

Bless us and splash us, precious.

1359
02:00:04,614 --> 02:00:07,242
That's a meaty mouthful.

1360
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:11,747
Gollum, gollum! Aah.

1361
02:00:13,081 --> 02:00:15,425
Back. Stay back.

1362
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:20,048
I'm warning you, don't come any closer.

1363
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:25,803
It's got an Elfish blade.
But it's not an Elfs.

1364
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:29,059
Not an Elfs, no.

1365
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:31,020
What is it, precious?

1366
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:33,522
What is it?

1367
02:00:33,685 --> 02:00:37,110
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

1368
02:00:38,064 --> 02:00:40,192
Bagginses?

1369
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:44,238
What is a Bagginses, precious?

1370
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:48,743
- I'm a Hobbit from the Shire.
- Oh.

1371
02:00:48,950 --> 02:00:54,298
We like Goblinses, batses and fishes.
But we hasn't tried Hobbitses before.

1372
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:58,464
Is it soft? Is it juicy?

1373
02:00:58,585 --> 02:01:02,215
Now, now, keep your distance!

1374
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:04,348
I'll use this if I have to.

1375
02:01:04,549 --> 02:01:05,550
Aah!

1376
02:01:05,717 --> 02:01:08,470
I don't want any trouble,
do you understand?

1377
02:01:08,678 --> 02:01:11,773
Just show me the way to get out of here
and I'll be on my way.

1378
02:01:11,931 --> 02:01:13,854
Why? Is it lost?

1379
02:01:14,058 --> 02:01:17,938
Yes. Yes, and I want to get unlost
as soon as possible.

1380
02:01:18,062 --> 02:01:20,941
Ooh, we knows!
We knows safe paths for Hobbitses.

1381
02:01:21,149 --> 02:01:23,243
Safe paths in the dark.

1382
02:01:23,401 --> 02:01:24,778
Shut up!

1383
02:01:24,903 --> 02:01:27,827
- I didn't say anything.
- We wasn't talking to you.

1384
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:30,750
Oh, yes, we was, precious. We was.

1385
02:01:31,159 --> 02:01:34,333
Look, I don't know what your game is,
but I...

1386
02:01:34,496 --> 02:01:35,998
Games?!

1387
02:01:36,206 --> 02:01:39,050
Oh, we love games,
doesn't we, precious?

1388
02:01:39,209 --> 02:01:43,680
Does it like games? Does it, does it?
Does it like to play?

1389
02:01:44,297 --> 02:01:45,594
Maybe.

1390
02:01:47,842 --> 02:01:52,439
<i>What has roots as nobody sees?</i>

1391
02:01:52,597 --> 02:01:55,316
<i>Is taller than trees?</i>

1392
02:01:55,517 --> 02:01:57,611
<i>Up, up, up it goes</i>

1393
02:01:57,769 --> 02:02:00,693
<i>And yet, never grows</i>

1394
02:02:01,815 --> 02:02:04,318
- The mountain.
- Yes, yes.

1395
02:02:04,484 --> 02:02:07,704
Oh, let's have another one, eh?

1396
02:02:07,821 --> 02:02:11,291
Yes! Do it again, do it again. Ask us.

1397
02:02:11,449 --> 02:02:14,498
No! No more riddles.

1398
02:02:14,869 --> 02:02:17,668
Finish him off. Finish him now!

1399
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:19,419
Gollum, gollum!

1400
02:02:19,582 --> 02:02:21,334
No! No. No.

1401
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:24,588
No. I want to play. I do.

1402
02:02:24,838 --> 02:02:27,387
I want to play. I can see...

1403
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:31,311
...you are very good at this.

1404
02:02:31,970 --> 02:02:33,688
So why don't we...

1405
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:37,938
...have a game of riddles? Yes?

1406
02:02:38,101 --> 02:02:39,774
Just you and me.

1407
02:02:40,228 --> 02:02:44,404
Yes. Yes, just us.

1408
02:02:44,649 --> 02:02:46,651
Yes. Yes.

1409
02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:48,988
And if I win...

1410
02:02:49,153 --> 02:02:52,157
...you show me the way out. Yes?

1411
02:02:52,323 --> 02:02:54,075
Yes. Yes.

1412
02:02:54,868 --> 02:02:57,917
And if it loses? What then?

1413
02:02:58,121 --> 02:03:01,546
Well, if it loses, precious,
then we eats it!

1414
02:03:02,834 --> 02:03:06,429
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.

1415
02:03:13,011 --> 02:03:14,684
Fair enough.

1416
02:03:18,933 --> 02:03:20,401
Well, Baggins first.

1417
02:03:27,233 --> 02:03:29,782
<i>Thirty white horses on a red hill</i>

1418
02:03:30,528 --> 02:03:33,372
<i>First they champ, then they stamp</i>

1419
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:35,078
<i>Then they stand still</i>

1420
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:48,175
Teeth?

1421
02:03:48,338 --> 02:03:52,263
Teeth! Oh, yes, my precious!

1422
02:03:52,884 --> 02:03:59,142
But we... We only have nine.

1423
02:04:01,976 --> 02:04:03,273
Our turn.

1424
02:04:04,062 --> 02:04:06,815
<i>Voiceless, it cries</i>

1425
02:04:07,315 --> 02:04:09,784
<i>Wingless flutters</i>

1426
02:04:10,443 --> 02:04:13,572
<i>Toothless bites</i>

1427
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:16,954
<i>Mouthless mutters</i>

1428
02:04:19,827 --> 02:04:22,580
Just a minute. Uh...

1429
02:04:23,581 --> 02:04:25,049
Oh. Oh!

1430
02:04:25,249 --> 02:04:26,842
We knows! We knows!

1431
02:04:27,043 --> 02:04:28,465
Shut up!

1432
02:04:34,634 --> 02:04:35,931
Wind.

1433
02:04:36,135 --> 02:04:38,638
It's wind. Of course it is.

1434
02:04:38,805 --> 02:04:41,775
Very clever, Hobbitses.

1435
02:04:41,975 --> 02:04:44,023
Very clever.

1436
02:04:44,227 --> 02:04:45,194
Ah-ah-ah.

1437
02:04:45,353 --> 02:04:50,280
<i>A box without hinges, key or lid</i>

1438
02:04:50,441 --> 02:04:53,945
<i>Yet golden treasure inside is hid</i>

1439
02:04:56,572 --> 02:04:57,824
Box.

1440
02:04:58,199 --> 02:05:00,668
Oh, um...

1441
02:05:00,785 --> 02:05:02,879
Box. The lid and a key.

1442
02:05:03,079 --> 02:05:06,424
- Well?
- It's nasty.

1443
02:05:08,459 --> 02:05:11,053
- Box. Key.
- Do you give up?

1444
02:05:11,212 --> 02:05:14,887
Give us a chance, precious!
Give us a chance!

1445
02:05:27,395 --> 02:05:28,738
Eggses!

1446
02:05:29,272 --> 02:05:30,945
Eggses!

1447
02:05:31,065 --> 02:05:34,569
Wet, crunchy little eggses. Yes.

1448
02:05:34,736 --> 02:05:39,287
Grandmother taught us
to suck them, yes!

1449
02:05:47,415 --> 02:05:50,919
We have one for you.

1450
02:05:51,461 --> 02:05:55,511
<i>All things it devours</i>

1451
02:05:55,673 --> 02:06:00,770
<i>Birds, beasts, trees, flowers</i>

1452
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:05,191
<i>Gnaws iron, bites steel</i>

1453
02:06:05,349 --> 02:06:09,104
<i>Grinds hard stones to meal</i>

1454
02:06:10,605 --> 02:06:12,232
Answer us.

1455
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:17,071
Give me a moment, please.
I gave you a good long while.

1456
02:06:17,278 --> 02:06:20,873
Birds, beasts... Beasts?
Trees, flowers.

1457
02:06:21,074 --> 02:06:22,496
I don't know this one.

1458
02:06:22,658 --> 02:06:25,878
Is it tasty?

1459
02:06:26,037 --> 02:06:30,417
Is it scrumptious?

1460
02:06:30,583 --> 02:06:32,085
Is it crunchable?

1461
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:33,757
Let me think.

1462
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:35,263
Let me think.

1463
02:06:40,051 --> 02:06:42,145
It's stuck.

1464
02:06:43,096 --> 02:06:47,647
Bagginses is stuck.

1465
02:06:51,229 --> 02:06:52,902
Time's up.

1466
02:06:56,818 --> 02:06:58,445
Time.

1467
02:06:58,611 --> 02:07:01,239
The answer is time.

1468
02:07:03,533 --> 02:07:04,955
Actually it wasn't that hard.

1469
02:07:07,411 --> 02:07:08,628
Last question.

1470
02:07:10,414 --> 02:07:12,166
Last chance.

1471
02:07:12,333 --> 02:07:14,006
Okay.

1472
02:07:16,504 --> 02:07:18,506
Ask us.

1473
02:07:19,757 --> 02:07:22,476
- Ask us!
- Yes, yes. All right.

1474
02:07:26,722 --> 02:07:31,068
What have I got in my pocket?

1475
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,948
That's no fair.

1476
02:07:36,691 --> 02:07:39,820
It's not fair! It's against the rules!

1477
02:07:41,821 --> 02:07:43,198
Now ask us another one.

1478
02:07:43,656 --> 02:07:44,953
No. No, no, no.

1479
02:07:45,116 --> 02:07:49,041
You said ask me a question.
Well, that is my question.

1480
02:07:49,245 --> 02:07:51,589
What have I got in my pocket?

1481
02:07:53,499 --> 02:07:56,548
Three guesses, precious.
It must give us three!

1482
02:07:56,836 --> 02:07:59,089
Three guesses. Very well, guess away.

1483
02:07:59,255 --> 02:08:00,472
Handses!

1484
02:08:00,673 --> 02:08:02,346
Wrong. Guess again.

1485
02:08:03,843 --> 02:08:07,939
Fishbones, Goblins' teeth,
wet shells, bats' wings...

1486
02:08:10,474 --> 02:08:12,568
Knife! Oh, shut up!

1487
02:08:12,768 --> 02:08:14,566
Wrong again. Last guess.

1488
02:08:14,729 --> 02:08:17,858
String. Or nothing.

1489
02:08:18,024 --> 02:08:21,949
Two guesses at once.
Wrong both times.

1490
02:08:24,864 --> 02:08:26,366
So...

1491
02:08:27,867 --> 02:08:31,417
Come, then. I won the game.
You promised to show me the way out.

1492
02:08:32,121 --> 02:08:35,000
Did we say so, precious?

1493
02:08:35,166 --> 02:08:38,340
Did we say so?

1494
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:45,931
What has it got in its pocketses?

1495
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:48,847
That's no concern of yours.

1496
02:08:49,472 --> 02:08:51,520
You lost.

1497
02:08:51,682 --> 02:08:53,650
Lost?

1498
02:08:55,436 --> 02:08:56,483
Lost?

1499
02:08:58,481 --> 02:08:59,903
Lost?

1500
02:09:07,031 --> 02:09:08,328
Where is it?

1501
02:09:09,242 --> 02:09:10,664
Where is it?!

1502
02:09:11,911 --> 02:09:13,003
No!

1503
02:09:15,331 --> 02:09:16,583
Where is it?!

1504
02:09:17,041 --> 02:09:19,635
No! No!

1505
02:09:21,128 --> 02:09:22,755
Lost!

1506
02:09:22,922 --> 02:09:25,220
Curse us and splash us!

1507
02:09:25,633 --> 02:09:29,638
My precious is lost!

1508
02:09:31,097 --> 02:09:35,398
- What have you lost?
- Mustn't ask us! Not its business!

1509
02:09:35,559 --> 02:09:37,482
No!

1510
02:09:37,645 --> 02:09:40,114
Gollum, gollum!

1511
02:09:52,785 --> 02:09:56,380
What has it got...

1512
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:59,254
...in its nasty...

1513
02:09:59,458 --> 02:10:02,177
little pocketses?

1514
02:10:12,179 --> 02:10:14,147
He stole it.

1515
02:10:15,516 --> 02:10:18,360
He stole it!

1516
02:10:21,856 --> 02:10:23,358
He stole it!

Charge!

1546
02:14:45,119 --> 02:14:46,587

Come on!

1556
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:36,314
- Watch your backs!
- You thought you could escape me.

1557
02:16:39,942 --> 02:16:42,411
What are you going to do now, Wizard?

1558
02:16:50,869 --> 02:16:52,667
That'll do it.

1559
02:17:27,364 --> 02:17:29,867
Well, that could have been worse.

1560
02:17:30,743 --> 02:17:32,120
Haver!

1561
02:17:32,286 --> 02:17:34,914
You've got to be joking!

1562

Gandalf!

1563
02:17:46,884 --> 02:17:49,103
There's too many. We can't fight them.

1564
02:17:49,261 --> 02:17:51,309
Only one thing will save us, daylight!

1565
02:17:51,513 --> 02:17:54,517
Come on! Here! On your feet.

1566
02:17:57,060 --> 02:17:59,279

02:18:01,231 --> 02:18:02,483
Wait!

02:18:02,649 --> 02:18:06,119
My precious. Wait!

Gollum, gollum!

1570
02:18:13,494 --> 02:18:15,588
Quick, quick!

1571
02:18:17,581 --> 02:18:18,628
This way.

1572
02:18:21,376 --> 02:18:24,471
- Come on.
- Come on, come on. Quickly.

1573
02:18:27,132 --> 02:18:28,850
Right, good!

1574
02:19:55,888 --> 02:19:57,231
Baggins!

1575
02:19:58,599 --> 02:20:00,567
Thief!

1576
02:20:01,435 --> 02:20:05,941
Curse it and crush it!
We hates it forever!

1577
02:20:18,577 --> 02:20:21,706
Five, six, seven, eight.

1578
02:20:22,205 --> 02:20:24,458
Bifur. Bofur. That's 10.

1579
02:20:24,583 --> 02:20:27,132
Fili, Kili! That's 12.

1580
02:20:27,461 --> 02:20:30,635
And Bombur. That makes 13.

1581
02:20:30,839 --> 02:20:32,887
Where's Bilbo?

1582
02:20:33,467 --> 02:20:35,595
Where is our Hobbit?

1583
02:20:36,678 --> 02:20:38,180
Where is our Hobbit?

1584
02:20:39,848 --> 02:20:42,647
Curse that Halfling! Now he's lost?

1585
02:20:42,809 --> 02:20:44,152
I thought he was with Dori!

1586
02:20:44,311 --> 02:20:47,406
- Don't blame me!
- Well, where did you last see him?

1587
02:20:47,564 --> 02:20:50,283
I think I saw him slip away
when they first collared us.

1588
02:20:50,442 --> 02:20:51,864
And what happened, exactly?

1589
02:20:51,985 --> 02:20:54,329
- Tell me!
- I'll tell you what happened.

1590
02:20:54,488 --> 02:20:57,332
Master Baggins saw his chance
and he took it.

1591
02:20:58,241 --> 02:21:01,245
He has thought of nothing
but his soft bed and his warm hearth...

1592
02:21:01,411 --> 02:21:03,789
...since first he stepped out of his door.

1593
02:21:03,956 --> 02:21:06,300
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

1594
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:08,506
He is long gone.

1595
02:21:20,931 --> 02:21:23,309
No. He isn't.

1596
02:21:27,688 --> 02:21:29,531
Bilbo Baggins.

1597
02:21:29,690 --> 02:21:32,489
I have never been so glad
to see anyone in my life.

1598
02:21:34,569 --> 02:21:36,492
Bilbo. We'd given you up.

1599
02:21:36,655 --> 02:21:38,578
How on earth
did you get past the Goblins?

1600
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:40,333
How, indeed.

1601
02:21:49,501 --> 02:21:52,471
Well, what does it matter? He's back.

1602
02:21:53,547 --> 02:21:56,391
It matters. I want to know.

1603
02:21:58,635 --> 02:22:00,308
Why did you come back?

1604
02:22:03,682 --> 02:22:06,777
Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.

1605
02:22:08,311 --> 02:22:11,281
And you're right, I often think of Bag-end.

1606
02:22:11,857 --> 02:22:13,905
I miss my books.

1607
02:22:14,651 --> 02:22:17,404
And my armchair and my garden.

1608
02:22:18,447 --> 02:22:19,790
See, that's where I belong.

1609
02:22:20,490 --> 02:22:22,413
That's home.

1610
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:26,038
And that's why I came back. Because...

1611
02:22:28,373 --> 02:22:31,252
...you don't have one. A home.

1612
02:22:31,918 --> 02:22:33,511
It was taken from you.

1613
02:22:36,590 --> 02:22:39,343
But I will help you take it back if I can.

1614
02:23:12,584 --> 02:23:14,086
Out of the frying pan.

1615
02:23:14,252 --> 02:23:16,596
And into the fire. Run.

1616
02:23:16,922 --> 02:23:18,720
Run!

1617
02:23:34,064 --> 02:23:35,486
Go!

1618
02:24:02,008 --> 02:24:03,305
Up into the trees!

1619
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:06,013
All of you! Come on, climb! Bilbo, climb!

1620
02:24:06,972 --> 02:24:08,394
Quickly!

1621
02:24:18,108 --> 02:24:19,109
They're coming!

1622
02:24:57,647 --> 02:24:59,365
- Hang on!
- Hold on, brothers!

1623
02:25:20,837 --> 02:25:22,305
Azog.

1624
02:25:48,990 --> 02:25:50,742
It cannot be.

1625
02:26:43,628 --> 02:26:45,756
It's going!

1626
02:27:35,305 --> 02:27:36,557
Fili!

1627
02:28:01,164 --> 02:28:02,256
Yeah!

1628
02:28:11,383 --> 02:28:12,930
No!

1629
02:28:19,641 --> 02:28:21,234
Oh, no.

1630
02:28:25,688 --> 02:28:27,065
Mr. Gandalf!

1631
02:28:32,946 --> 02:28:34,038
Oh, no, Dori!

1632
02:29:45,059 --> 02:29:46,527
Help!

1633
02:30:04,370 --> 02:30:07,123
No!

1634
02:30:18,259 --> 02:30:20,808
Thorin! No!

1635
02:33:19,148 --> 02:33:20,570
Look.

1636
02:34:08,197 --> 02:34:09,915
Thorin!

1637
02:35:24,816 --> 02:35:26,363
Thorin!

1638
02:35:30,154 --> 02:35:31,155
Thorin.

1639
02:35:48,714 --> 02:35:49,840
The Halfling?

1640
02:35:50,925 --> 02:35:52,973
It's all right.

1641
02:35:53,344 --> 02:35:56,598
Bilbo is here. He's quite safe.

1642
02:36:06,482 --> 02:36:07,529
You!

1643
02:36:11,487 --> 02:36:13,330
What were you doing?

1644
02:36:13,489 --> 02:36:16,038
You nearly got yourself killed!

1645
02:36:17,994 --> 02:36:20,668
Did I not say that
you would be a burden?

1646
02:36:21,455 --> 02:36:24,504
That you would not survive in the Wild?

1647
02:36:25,084 --> 02:36:27,007
That you had no place amongst us?

1648
02:36:32,592 --> 02:36:36,722
I have never been so wrong in all my life.

1649
02:36:48,691 --> 02:36:50,238
But I'm sorry I doubted you.

1650
02:36:50,401 --> 02:36:53,280
No, I would have doubted me too.

1651
02:36:53,446 --> 02:36:56,575
I'm not a hero or a warrior.

1652
02:36:58,576 --> 02:37:00,328
Not even a burglar.

1653
02:37:19,722 --> 02:37:22,271
Is that what I think it is?

1654
02:37:37,239 --> 02:37:38,286
Erebor...

1655
02:37:39,909 --> 02:37:41,786
...the Lonely Mountain...

1656
02:37:41,994 --> 02:37:46,545
...the last of the great Dwarf kingdoms
of Middle-earth.

1657
02:37:49,085 --> 02:37:51,053
Our home.

1658
02:37:55,424 --> 02:37:56,676
A raven!

1659
02:37:56,884 --> 02:38:00,104
The birds are returning to the mountain.

1660
02:38:03,349 --> 02:38:07,354
That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.

1661
02:38:08,354 --> 02:38:10,527
But we'll take it as a sign.

1662
02:38:10,690 --> 02:38:13,944
- A good omen.
- You're right.

1663
02:38:14,151 --> 02:38:17,280
