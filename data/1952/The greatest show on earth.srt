1
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:17,977
We bring you the circus.

2
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:23,346
The pied piper, whose magic tunes
lead children of all ages, from 6 to 60,

3
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:28,417
into a tinsel and spun-candy world
of reckless beauty

4
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:31,704
and mounting laughter, whirling thrills,

5
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:34,142
the rhythm, excitement and grace

6
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:36,695
of daring and blaring and dance,

7
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:40,063
of high-stepping horses
and high-flying stars.

8
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,785
But behind all this,

9
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:45,463
the circus is a massive machine

10
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:49,665
whose very life depends on
discipline, motion and speed.

11
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:52,215
A mechanized army on wheels

12
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:55,140
that rolls over any obstacle in its path,

13
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:58,299
that meets calamity again and again,

14
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,537
but always comes up smiling.

15
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:05,260
A place where disaster and tragedy
stalk the big top,

16
00:03:05,347 --> 00:03:08,817
haunt the backyard
and ride the circus train,

17
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:12,584
where death is constantly watching

18
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:16,342
for one frayed rope, one weak link,

19
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:19,456
or one trace of fear.

20
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:22,940
A fierce, primitive fighting force

21
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:26,542
that smashes relentlessly forward
against impossible odds,

22
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,263
that is the circus.

23
00:03:29,987 --> 00:03:33,343
And this is the story
of the biggest of the big tops

24
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:37,625
and of the men and women who fight
to make it the greatest show on earth.

25
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,263
- Morning, Mr Braden.
- Morning, Nick.

26
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:48,259
- When's the new hor'se arriving, Brad?
- Tomorrow, Chuck.

27
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:54,737
Dont rub them thin, Jimmy.
Tho'se bell's are 60 year's old.

28
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:56,738
Theyve rung in 'some good 'show's.

29
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,976
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr Braden.

30
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,102
How are the kid's?

31
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:04,782
Oh, ju'st fine, except they were playing
with Randy Concello a few day's ago.

32
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:05,902
That's nice.

33
00:04:05,987 --> 00:04:08,023
Ye's, but Randy came down
with the mump's thi's morning.

34
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:10,905
What? No. Any 'sign's?

35
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:13,740
No, not yet,
but baby gorilla's do get the mump's.

36
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:15,704
Ill have Higgin's give them
a 'shot of immune 'serum

37
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:18,381
and double their cod liver oil.
Give them plenty of 'spinach.

38
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,662
You 'stay healthy now, boy, you hear?

39
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:23,056
Say, i's it true were only gonna play
a 'short 'sea'son thi's year?

40
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:24,626
Dont believe all you hear.

41
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:26,101
- See?
- Go back to Mama now.

42
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:28,657
I told you there wa's nothing to it.

43
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:38,265
- How's Myrtle?
- Stomach.

44
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:41,218
Give her 'some gin and ginger.

45
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:46,337
- Any new's about a full 'sea'son?
- Youll get a full 'sea'son.

46
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:48,383
Be 'sure Myrtle get's all the gin.

47
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,661
- Same old trouble?
- Yeah. Sore throat. All of it.

48
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:00,102
Well, get a billiard cue and 'swab it out.

49
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:05,539
Better feed your bird, Lou.

50
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:08,858
Hey, Brad, Betty in the cookhou'se 'said

51
00:05:08,947 --> 00:05:11,461
were only gonna play
the big citie's thi's year.

52
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:13,822
And then clo'se up like a mi'ser's heart.

53
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:16,462
Well, if theyre giving odd's,
bet a buck for me.

54
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:18,299
Why the rehear'sal
ju'st for makeup, Brad?

55
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:21,618
Becau'se you left off your eyela'she's
la'st performance la'st 'sea'son.

56
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:24,858
Youre gonna need an extra 'shoe
walking back from Kalamazoo.

57
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:26,539
Im 'suppo'sed to be
looking for you, Brad.

58
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:27,901
Well, are you 'suppo'sed to find me?

59
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:30,581
Big bra's's hollering for you up front.

60
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:31,941
You found me.

61
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,023
Hey, Brad, thi's might help.

62
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:36,621
Too 'small.

63
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,259
Skim off the cream.

64
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,305
Let the little 'show's 'scramble
for the thin milk.

65
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:53,299
Dont forget what circu's day mean's
to a 'small town.

66
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,537
John North, youre ju'st
'soft about the circu's.

67
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:57,982
It's 'suicide to play
thi's whole tour thi's year.

68
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,739
- You gonna tell that to Brad?
- Ye's.

69
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,738
A good circu's bo's's carrie's out order's.

70
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:03,818
My vote i's 10 week's
and back to Sara'sota.

71
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:04,896
But for 80 year's...

72
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:08,662
That order about keeping the ground's
clean goe's for the top bra's's, too.

73
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:10,066
- Hi, Brad. Im 'sorry about that.
- Good morning.

74
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:12,217
Ive 'seen happier head's on cane's.

75
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:13,501
We 'sent for you, Brad, to tell you

76
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:15,339
weve got to pa's's up
the 'small citie's and town's.

77
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:17,497
- Time's have changed.
- Kid's havent.

78
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,578
- Price's have.
- Well 'stay in the black.

79
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:20,702
You hope.

80
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:23,585
Look, Brad,
here's the tour for thi's 'sea'son.

81
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,061
That's only 10 week's.

82
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:29,503
Sixty percent of our money come's
from the big citie's in the fir'st 10 week's.

83
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:31,862
The world's up'side down, Brad.
We cant take the ri'sk...

84
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:34,302
Our people ri'sk their neck's twice a day.

85
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:37,026
Well have a 'short 'sea'son,
no red ink and no trouble.

86
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:38,301
Trouble's part of the circu's.

87
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:40,742
They 'said Barnum wa's in trouble
when he lo'st Tom Thumb.

88
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:43,136
They 'said he wa's through
when Jumbo died.

89
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:46,458
Were the greate'st 'show on earth, and
you cant put 1,400 people out of work

90
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,060
becau'se the world ha's a 'stomach ache.

91
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:51,583
And you cant ri'sk $25,000 a day
on a 'sentimental journey, either.

92
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:55,023
If youll play only the big citie's, youll cut
the heart right out of thi's 'show.

93
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:58,304
In two 'sea'son's, youll de'stroy
what it took hi's family 80 year's to build.

94
00:06:58,387 --> 00:07:00,696
I might vote a few week's more
if we had a bigger headline.

95
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,982
- Holly i'snt known.
- Well, weve got one.

96
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,903
- Didnt you tell him, John?
- Not yet.

97
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:07,420
Who i's it, Johnny?

98
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:09,737
Have you brought
Gargantua back to life?

99
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:11,742
The Great Seba'stian.

100
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:12,862
- What?
- Oh, no!

101
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:14,175
Obviou'sly, youre crazy.

102
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,223
Seba'stian's wrecked every 'show
he's been with.

103
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:19,424
- But he draw's like 'sugar in fly time.
- Nobody can handle him.

104
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:22,146
- He's never worked for Brad.
- Youre buying trouble, Johnny.

105
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:24,536
Im buying the be'st trapeze act
in the air.

106
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:27,983
Well, he may be a god in the air,
but he's a devil on the ground.

107
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,295
You mean with women?

108
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:31,264
Do you know how many women
thi's 'show carrie's?

109
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:32,826
He's not that good,
no matter what youve heard.

110
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:34,863
- Thing's are bad enough a's it i's.
- No, Brad, it's too big a gamble.

111
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:37,984
You havent 'sold me.
Im 'still again'st going under canva's.

112
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,535
- Are you for Seba'stian?
- Ye's.

113
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,619
Becau'se the only way we could get him
wa's to 'sign him for the full 'sea'son.

114
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:45,186
I knew there wa's a trick in it.

115
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:47,576
You cant get good act's
for a 10-week 'sea'son!

116
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,816
Cool off, Brad.

117
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:51,057
Were going to 'stay out
a's long a's were in the black.

118
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:52,182
Agreed?

119
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:53,859
- A's long a's we make money, ye's.
- Lf you 'say 'so, John.

120
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:54,936
Well, I dont like it, John.

121
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:56,176
Thank you, gentlemen. That's it.

122
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,383
And youd better 'start
worrying about Seba'stian.

123
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:00,583
- Let me 'show you...
- You try to give...

124
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:01,736
I cant believe it.

125
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:07,015
Hey, Lucky, keep tho'se cat's covered
when you move them.

126
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:08,381
Okay, Mr Braden.

127
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:10,780
- Brad?
- Yeah?

128
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:14,305
You know Seba'stian only work's
in the centre ring.

129
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:15,661
I know it.

130
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:17,738
Id rather crawl in that cage of cat's

131
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:20,660
than have to tell Holly
'she's out of the centre ring.

132
00:08:21,187 --> 00:08:22,302
So would I.

133
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:24,343
You can blame me if you want to.

134
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:27,177
Thank's, but it's my medicine. Ill take it.

135
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:32,024
Come on, boy. Come on.

136
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:37,975
Hey, Tuffy, off your back
and on your toe's.

137
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:40,103
And give me
a little more 'slack thi's time.

138
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,257
You got ample rope now for a hanging.

139
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:44,144
One more and lm going to do
without the mechanic.

140
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:45,819
No deal. Ill put up a net.

141
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:48,057
What do you think I am, a fi'sh?

142
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:50,342
You better u'se a net for thi's one,
or youll break your neck,

143
00:08:50,427 --> 00:08:52,099
and Brad will break mine.

144
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,860
Now dont get 'sentimental, Tuffy.
Come on, let's go.

145
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:57,336
If Brad 'see's thi's,
hell chew your ear's off.

146
00:08:58,267 --> 00:08:59,905
Snap your leg's now.

147
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,820
All the way together, Lena.

148
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:04,546
Point your toe's, Janet.
A little more curve.

149
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,821
Relax, relax.

150
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:07,101
- Any new's?
- Nope.

151
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:08,825
Come on, now. Let's get over it.

152
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:12,066
Fa'ster, Loni, fa'ster.

153
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:21,105
What give's, Button's?

154
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:24,259
Holly's hatched up a new hair-rai'ser
for that centre 'spot.

155
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:26,664
Quiet around the centre ring!

156
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:28,863
Everybody, 'still a minute, plea'se!

157
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:31,536
Time...

158
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:34,906
Terrific, Holly!

159
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:36,780
Pretty good.

160
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:40,861
Hi, Brad. Do you like it?

161
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,824
You try it again and III ground you.

162
00:09:42,907 --> 00:09:44,625
It's the fini'sh on my new act.

163
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:46,538
Itll fini'sh you and your act.

164
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:48,699
Dont you want to 'see it once more?

165
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,061
No. Come on down.

166
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:53,745
Okay, youre the bo's's. Watch it, Tuffy.

169
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:03,180
That ankle drop i's out.
I want you all in one piece.

170
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:11,139
That's for making the big bra's's

171
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:13,821
You got that trapeze
wired for 'sound, pigeon?

172
00:10:14,787 --> 00:10:17,938
But youre the kind of fellow
who could talk anybody into anything.

173
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:19,745
- You did, didnt you?
- Yeah.

174
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,385
Hey, kid's, Brad fixed it.

Down, move down.

00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:33,382
Why?

179
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,617
Do I have to have an excu'se
to leave the room?

180
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:37,743
You know, I think it i's the trou'ser's.

181
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:39,385
Wherever there are trou'ser's, you go.

182
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:42,698
- Full 'sea'son, Loni.
- Oh! He filled it.

183
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,460
The full 'sea'son will buy me
a 'sable-dyed rabbit coat.

184
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:46,946
What you have on, I like.

185
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:49,666
Well, 'sugar, like it a little farther away.

186
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:53,302
- No layoff, Buzzy!
- Tell him, Dai'sy.

187
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,786
Were hitting the 'stick's.

188
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:55,902
Terrific.

189
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:05,422
Okay...

00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:09,662
Youre wonderful!

192

All right, quiet down, everybody.
Quiet down!

193
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:15,736
Now, li'sten, and get thi's, all of you.

194
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:18,863
We only 'stay out
a's long a's were in the black.

195
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:20,300
Well be in the black, right?

196
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:23,060
You mean we all got

197
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:27,539
- And Seba'stian, too!
- Seba'stian?

198
00:11:27,907 --> 00:11:30,296
- Seba'stian?
- Seba'stian?

199
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:32,981
- Oh, no, he's not.

200
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,420
Aint he in Europe?

201
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,816
- Oh, boy, wait till you 'see him.
- Who did you 'say?

202
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:39,705
Well, I dont know, but I heard
that The Great Seba'stian's coming.

203
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:41,140
I's that true, Brad?

204
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:44,216
New's 'sure travel's fa'st around here.

205
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:47,543
He's 'strictly centre ring, i'snt he?

206
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:49,061
That's right.

207
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:56,140
- Hi. Aint it great?
- Terrific.

208
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:57,262
Oh, boy!

209
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:59,659
Do you know what thi's i's?

210
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:02,819
Well, 'sure.
It's my iron-jaw mouthpiece. Why?

211
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:05,667
Put it in your gabby mouth
and keep it 'shut.

212
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:07,783
- Whered you leave the prop's?
- Right over here.

213
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:10,022
He can take care of u's now.

214
00:12:10,107 --> 00:12:12,780
All right. Get your bit's, girl's.
You, too, Philip.

215
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:15,737
Well, I gue's's I know where I 'stand.

216
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:17,146
- Holly, li'sten...
- To what?

217
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:20,060
More promi'se's about next year,
the year after that?

218
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,978
I wa's a fool to believe you.

219
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:24,342
Youd 'sell out
your own grandmother for a name act.

220
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,816
- You know there's nobody...
- Dont 'say youre 'sorry.

221
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:27,896
I couldnt take that.

222
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:29,943
Im 'sorry there's only one centre ring.

223
00:12:30,027 --> 00:12:32,587
Oh, 'sure. I know. The 'show come's fir'st.

224
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:33,656
I didnt want to do thi's.

225
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:36,500
Save your breath.
I know ju'st what youre gonna 'say.

226
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:40,023
Oh, Brad, I had the centre ring.
You told me I could have it.

227
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,143
Holly, you want the 'show
to play the road, dont you?

228
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:43,785
I worked in every act in thi's circu's.

229
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:46,461
Im in 'spec, lm in manage,
lm a ro'se on the beauty float,

230
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:48,697
I fill in with the flyer's.
I work from 'start to fini'sh.

231
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:51,301
Well, 'so do mo'st of the other's.
It wa's the only way to get a full 'sea'son.

232
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:52,422
But my own act,

233
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:55,067
the one thing that's really mine,
that lve worked on for three year's,

234
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:56,626
that you to's's right out of the centre ring.

235
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:59,619
Pigeon, look, youre the be'st trapeze act
in the 'show.

236
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:03,222
- Then why dont you leave me in centre?
- Becau'se Seba'stian's a bigger draw.

237
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:05,263
Brad, III draw them. Leave me there.

238
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:08,339
Seba'stian's 'sure. Youre a chance.

239
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:15,939
You dont take chance's
with the 'show, do you?

240
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:17,336
No.

241
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:19,701
All right.

242
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:21,866
Ill move over.

243
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:23,735
Where do I go?

244
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:27,101
Ring one.

245
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,301
Oh, Brad,

246
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:34,106
Id do my act in clown alley
or the hor'se top for you.

247
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,938
Id do anything if it wa's ju'st for you.

248
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:41,824
Pigeon, look, out under the 'sky,
you know how I feel about you.

249
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:46,017
But under the big top,
one performer's ju'st like another to me.

250
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,538
Youve got nothing
but 'sawdu'st in your vein's.

251
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,061
Ive 'scraped too many of you kinker's up
from the 'sawdu'st

252
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:52,978
to let anybody get under my 'skin.

253
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,341
Ju'st 'so the 'show roll's.

254
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:56,543
You dont care who it roll's over
or who it hurt's.

255
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,776
So it roll's over me.

256
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,903
Be careful 'someday
it doe'snt roll over you.

257
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:00,976
Dont worry.

258
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:04,662
Ill have my rigging out of centre
before The Great Seba'stian arrive's.

259
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:08,503
- Tuffy, tear down my rigging.
- Okay.

260
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:15,700
Like peanut's, Harry?

261
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:19,695
I got everything lined up,
Mr Hender'son.

262
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:21,459
Gaff wheel's, noveltie's for 'sucker bait,

263
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:23,378
and two of the be'st 'stickmen
in the racket's.

264
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,344
Ill work it ju'st like the Columbia 'show.

265
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:28,146
No, Harry, you got a tough guy here
you didnt have at Columbia.

266
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:30,263
Brad Braden? III handle him.

267
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:32,983
With your brain's,
you couldnt handle that hippo.

268
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:36,184
Li'sten, if Braden get's in my way,
III roll right over him.

269
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:39,103
Hed break you in two.

270
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:41,139
Not with you backing me,
Mr Hender'son.

271
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:43,138
He's too 'smart to tangle with your boy's.

272
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:45,457
Ill cut him in, maybe.

273
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:50,063
You cant buy men like Braden.
And dont meet him head-on.

274
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,583
Okay, III go around him.

275
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:55,502
Great.

276
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:58,541
What about the bankroll for the game's?

277
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:01,978
Have 'some more peanut's, Harry.

278
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:05,776
Peanut's?

279
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:21,461
Hi, potato. Getting ready to roll?

280
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,939
What's the potato gag?

281
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:27,136
- Here, wrap that for me, will you?
- Okay.

282
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,697
Well, there's ma'shed potatoe's
and ha'shed potatoe's, 'sweet potatoe's.

283
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:34,579
I dont feel very 'sweet,

284
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:37,185
except maybe about you.

285
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,417
Youre alway's helping everybody,
Button's.

286
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,465
- Brad a'sked me to help you.
- Wa's he 'sorry about it?

287
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,537
Maybe he wa's ju'st worried
I wouldnt have my rigging down

288
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:49,219
before The Great Seba'stian arrive's.

289
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:50,706
Could be. Could be.

290
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:54,425
He doe'snt con'sider anybody's feeling's
when it come's to running the circu's.

291
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:57,624
Youre telling me.
Im 'so mad I could 'spit.

292
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,345
Well, why dont you 'spit then?

293
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,418
You know, Brad's not a man,
he's a machine,

294
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,225
like the tractor's and the generator's.

295
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:08,339
Why, Button's,
I thought you were hi's friend.

296
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:11,859
Well, he broke hi's word to you.
You could never tru'st him again.

297
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:13,820
That i'snt true!

298
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,182
Brad's been worried 'sick
about getting u's all a full 'sea'son.

299
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,417
If he had to throw me out,
he had to throw me out and it's...

300
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:23,421
You didnt mean
any of what you ju'st 'said.

301
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,941
I made you 'see it hi's way a little,
didnt I?

302
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,661
Darn you.

303
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,223
- You make me feel like a big idiot.
- Yeah, well, 'stop acting like one then.

304
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:36,937
Well, anyway, lm 'still mad at him.
And lm mad at you, too.

305
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:40,019
Say, that's pretty neat.

306
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:43,338
Remind's me of a bandage I wore once
when I 'sprained my ankle.

307
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,579
Button's, why can Brad hurt me 'so?

308
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:54,737
Why do I alway's want to hurt him back?

309
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:00,136
They 'say each man kill's
the thing he love's.

310
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:05,462
A coward doe's it with a ki's's,
a brave man with a 'sword.

311
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:07,219
Why, that's crazy.

312
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:09,263
You wouldnt hurt anyone you loved.

313
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:11,907
Who know's what a man will do
when he's in love?

314
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:14,862
Every girl in the 'show ha's tried for you.

315
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:17,538
But I gue's's
you already have 'someone, huh?

316
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:18,662
Could be.

317
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:21,781
I's 'she in one of the town's
were gonna play?

318
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:24,665
I havent 'seen the route 'sheet.

319
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:27,545
I's that why you dont try
to romance any of the gal's?

320
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,418
No. Clown's are funny people, Holly.

321
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:32,380
They only love once.

322
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:37,985
All men arent that way
even if they act like clown's.

323
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,466
No, I 'suppo'se not.

324
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:43,944
Oh, Button's, lm all ache in'side,

325
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,661
having a man love 'sawdu'st
more than me.

326
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:50,582
Well, maybe hell have
to make a choice 'someday.

327
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:52,182
Choice?

328
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:56,658
If ever lm in hi's arm's,
hi's head will be in the machine 'shop

329
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:58,978
- or bedding down the hippopotamu's.

330
00:18:00,307 --> 00:18:02,980
Youre lucky. Everybody love's you.

331
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,261
Ten million kid's and your girl.

332
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:10,338
Youll be 'seeing her pretty 'soon.

333
00:18:10,947 --> 00:18:12,505
We roll in three day's.

334
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:14,582

335
00:18:16,987 --> 00:18:18,022
Yeah.

336
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:23,903
Into the sunshine of spring,

337
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:27,263
the circus rises
from its winter hibernation,

338
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:28,666
spick-and-span,

339
00:18:28,747 --> 00:18:31,944
and ready for eight months
of excitement and adventure.

340
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,306
The circus trains, like Noahs Ark,

341
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:38,185
will carry and shelter man and beast

342
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:41,737
through flood and mud
and heat and storm,

343
00:18:41,827 --> 00:18:43,704
through triumph and adversity.

344
00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:45,937
1,400 souls,

345
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:49,656
each sure the season will bring
his hearts desire.

346
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:52,307
- You dropped 'something!
- Hey, look out, look out.

347
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:55,656
Why dont you drive
where youre looking?

348
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,142
I wi'sh one of your dog's would bite you.

349
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:03,345
All right, boy's! Come on.

350
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,741
All right. Keep it coming.
Keeping it coming. That's right.

351
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:09,146
Keep it coming.

352
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:20,024
Get tight in front of tho'se wheel's.

353
00:19:20,107 --> 00:19:22,905
Cant locate Seba'stian.
Tried the ho'spital's, the hotel's.

354
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:25,626
Straighten that wagon out!
Come on! Get with it!

355
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:28,421
We pull out in a half an hour
whether he's aboard or not.

356
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:30,577
Check both railroad 'station's and...

357
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:38,097
- Who's that?
- Seba'stian, I gue's's.

358
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:47,222
- Hi, Seba'stian.
- Hello!

359
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,500
Get a load of that.

360
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:52,700
Where's the fire at?

361
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,495
Oh, baby!

362
00:20:14,427 --> 00:20:15,576
Thi's ought to be good.

363
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,419
Where i's the bo's's man?

364
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:23,179
I thought he wa's.

365
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:26,701
I am Seba'stian.
I am honoured to be with you.

366
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:29,460
I hope your act's
a's good a's your entrance.

367
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:32,300
Ive 'seen them all arrive,
Caldona, The Concello's,

368
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,978
none of them ever came
with a funeral e'scort.

369
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,786
The police e'scort, it wa's not my idea.

370
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:41,621
- I clocked him at 75 in a 15-mile zone.
- Running a red light.

371
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,220
I got him for cutting in and out of traffic

372
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:44,706
on the wrong 'side of the highway.

373
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:46,505
In the war, I drive a tank.

374
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,622
Sometime's I forget. I forgot.

375
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:53,063
Yeah, well, the judge will add that up
to about $100 or 60 day's.

376
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:54,182
$100?

377
00:20:58,227 --> 00:21:00,058
Then itll be 60 day's in jail.

378
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:03,585
I would hate to be ab'sent
the fir'st two month's of the 'show.

379
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:07,337
Okay, boy's. Ill buy him back.

380
00:21:09,147 --> 00:21:11,377
Take my jeep, Law'son.
Settle it in the office.

381
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:12,820
Get your baggage aboard.

382
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:15,546
You can park that heap
in the menagerie hou'se.

383
00:21:15,627 --> 00:21:16,821
I 'salute you.

384
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:19,137
We 'shall get along together 'splendidly.

385
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:28,136
Hey!

386
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:29,982
Dont crowd, mi'ster.

387
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:33,104
Cant you 'see an elephant,
or do I have to paint her red?

388
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:38,065
I wa's blinded by the memory
of an unforgettable night in Pari's.

389
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:41,737
Blow up your water wing's, girl's.
Here come's the big wave.

390
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:43,581
Come on, Ruth.

391
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,901
How come no hu'sband ever 'shot you?

392
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:48,943
I never offer a 'sitting target.

393
00:21:50,187 --> 00:21:51,540
I thought Id 'seen the la'st of you

394
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:54,141
when you got mixed up
with that wirewalker from Li'sbon.

395
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:56,104
You will never 'see the la'st of me, Angel.

396
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:57,256
Angel!

397
00:21:57,787 --> 00:22:00,142
That will be arranged
when you meet Klau's.

398
00:22:02,707 --> 00:22:03,822
Angel!

399
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:05,900
Seba'stian!

400
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:11,543
- Hello, hand'some. Remember?
- Natalia!

401
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,778
- No, honey ball, Phylli's.
- Of cour'se.

402
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,335
Lovely Phylli's
with the charming iron jaw.

403
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:20,776
Well,

404
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:21,856
All right.

405
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:24,825
It 'save's your feet.
Sure tough on your clothe's, though.

406
00:22:24,907 --> 00:22:26,306
Thank's for the ride, 'sugar.

407
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,866
You know Seba'stian, eh?

408
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:30,905
- Sure, were old friend's.
- How good friend's?

409
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:33,536
Li'sten, you can worry
about any other guy in the 'show,

410
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:34,776
but not Seba'stian.

411
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:37,825
I wouldnt want him
if he were dipped in gold du'st.

412
00:22:41,107 --> 00:22:43,575
We will make
beautiful mu'sic together, huh?

413
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:47,057
Yeah, the la'st time,
I remember a few 'sour note's.

414
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:48,375
Oh, Natalia wa's...

Oh, that's the giant and the fat boy.

421
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,066
No, no. In between.

422
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:04,459
- Oh, that's Holly.
- Holly?

423
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:06,620
She's intere'sting.

424
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:09,505
I wouldnt meet her ju'st now
if I were you.

425
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:11,782

430
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,184
- Oh, my feet are killing me.
- Well, then, keep off of mine.

431
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:33,417
Pardon.

00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:35,225

Dont worry. She's a vegetarian.

467
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:20,425
Brad! Brad!

468
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,380

If you do a double, III do a triple.

Not while lm around, you wont.

Be'st publicity gag in a long time.

00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:42,419
It's no gag, brother.

557
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:43,656
You wouldnt kid me, would you?

558
00:31:43,747 --> 00:31:45,783
Kid you? Theyre working without net's.

559
00:31:57,147 --> 00:31:58,660
Boy, look at that guy.

560
00:32:02,627 --> 00:32:03,776
Look at her!

561
00:32:10,507 --> 00:32:12,065
If they dont get killed.

562
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:15,097
It's all done with mirror's, mi'ster.

563
00:32:37,987 --> 00:32:40,945
- Well, what are they going to do now?
- Changing bar's.

564
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:24,578
Should I whi'stle them down, Brad?
Theyre changing their act.

565
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:34,746
No. Leave them alone.

566
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,139
Theyre doing all right.

567
00:33:37,387 --> 00:33:38,900
Okay. Youre the bo's's.

568
00:34:38,427 --> 00:34:41,658
Hey, Seba'stian,

569
00:34:47,107 --> 00:34:49,701
How long do you think thi's can go on
before 'something happen's?

570
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,379
That's circu's, i'snt it?

571
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:15,705
Do you believe in prayer?

572
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:17,540
And practi'se.

573
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:20,380
- What if one of them fall's?
- Nobody's going to fall.

574
00:35:20,947 --> 00:35:23,063
Thi's i's packing them in every 'show.

575
00:35:23,507 --> 00:35:27,295
- We 'stay in the black or clo'se down.
- Oh, 'stop talking 'so tough.

576
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,937
You know, that i'snt the ba's's drum
I hear thumping.

577
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,062
That's your heart.

578
00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:32,739
You know...

579
00:35:32,827 --> 00:35:33,816

00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:56,785
Well, lve had enough.

581
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:03,098
Well, that wa's a clo'se one.

582
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:37,105
Well, are you ready to call it off?

583
00:38:37,187 --> 00:38:39,655
I have not 'started yet,
but you were magnificent.

584
00:38:39,747 --> 00:38:41,863
- Sure 'stole it today, Holly.
- Thank's, Bob.

585
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:43,824
You two had quite a party up there,
didnt you?

586
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,579
Did you notice
which ring they were looking at?

587
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:48,261
If you really want to kill your'self,
wait till the 'sea'son's over.

588
00:38:48,347 --> 00:38:49,621
Well, what do you know?
He wa's worried about me.

589
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:50,742
So wa's I.

590
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:53,660
From here on, cut out the dogfight's
up there and 'stick to your act's.

591
00:38:53,747 --> 00:38:55,817
Brad, dont be a killjoy.

592
00:38:55,907 --> 00:38:58,375
You dont know what it's like up there.
It's a different world.

593
00:38:58,467 --> 00:39:00,105
Ju'st the two of u's fighting for the crowd.

594
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:02,906
You feel like you could do anything.
Were not people up there.

595
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:05,421
Were like two 'streak's of light
with wing's and...

596
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:09,385
You wouldnt under'stand.

597
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,980
- Nobody would, except another flyer.
- Like Seba'stian?

598
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:17,342
Yeah.

599
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:20,306
Like Seba'stian.

600
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:22,742
Come on, come on.
We need people for the 'spec.

601
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,421
- Did you watch the 'show?
- Yeah. It wa's terrific!

602
00:39:25,747 --> 00:39:27,703
- McClo'sky want's you, Brad.
- Okay.

603
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:31,381
- Did you follow me?
- Yeah.

604
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:33,298
- That's not the half of it!
- Plea'se go up to the co'stume...

605
00:39:33,387 --> 00:39:35,981
You and Seba'stian got an exclu'sive
little club up there in the air?

606
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:37,898
Get your'self a trapeze
if you want to join.

607
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:40,217
And dont park your chewing gum
on the moon again, plea'se.

608
00:39:40,307 --> 00:39:43,026
Why dont he look at me anymore?
Have I got too much or not enough?

609
00:39:43,107 --> 00:39:45,257
Dont worry, 'sugar.
Hell get around to you.

610
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:47,019
- Im hoping.
- Maybe he wont.

611
00:39:47,107 --> 00:39:48,460
Did your elephant 'sit on thi's zipper?

612
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:50,219
He 'say's were arti'st's up there together.

613
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,457
Hed tell that to a trained 'seal
if it paid off.

614
00:39:52,547 --> 00:39:55,141
Maybe he 'show's hi's bad 'side
to you and hi's good 'side to me.

615
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,979
Li'sten, Snow White,
youre not fighting thi's guy,

616
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:58,216
youre falling for him.

617
00:39:58,307 --> 00:40:00,741
He wa's good enough for you once.
Maybe youd like to have him back.

618
00:40:00,827 --> 00:40:02,340
I wouldnt give Seba'stian the right time

619
00:40:02,427 --> 00:40:04,577
if Brad wa's a's nut's about me
a's he i's about you.

620
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:05,736
Brad? Are you kidding?

621
00:40:05,827 --> 00:40:08,387
I come fourth. After Ringling Bro's.,
Barnum and Bailey.

622
00:40:08,467 --> 00:40:10,105
Youre eating too many potatoe's.

623
00:40:10,187 --> 00:40:11,461
When Brad doe'snt come home night's,

624
00:40:11,547 --> 00:40:13,856
youll know the blonde
he's 'sitting up with i's a giraffe.

625
00:40:15,027 --> 00:40:17,985
Hey, Holly, you trying to corner
the market or ju'st 'starting a collection?

626
00:40:18,507 --> 00:40:20,304
- My...
- Well, you only work with your teeth.

627
00:40:20,387 --> 00:40:23,220
Get with it, Mabel. Three minute's.
So let's get it all on.

628
00:40:23,307 --> 00:40:24,376
Okay.

629
00:40:25,107 --> 00:40:26,096
If it were only you, 'sugar,

630
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:28,940
Id let you ride the roller coa'ster
all the way down.

631
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,619
But lm thinking about Brad.

632
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:32,937
Why do you want to bu'st up
the 'swelle'st guy in the circu's?

633
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:34,858
Sound's like youve got it bad.

634
00:40:34,947 --> 00:40:37,825
He's the only guy that look's at me
that I dont know what he's thinking.

635
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:38,942
He's thinking circu's.

636
00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:41,587
He ha'snt thought anything but circu's
'since he fell out of the cradle.

637
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:43,942
But if you want him 'so bad,
what's 'stopping you?

638
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,858
Maybe becau'se I knew
too many guy's like Seba'stian

639
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:47,141
before I met Brad.

640
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:48,865
Been around too much, huh?

641
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,903
You havent been
gathering any mo's's, either.

642
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:53,059
Brad's a one-woman man.

643
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:55,661
Ive got a feeling
he want's a one-man woman.

644
00:40:57,947 --> 00:40:59,346
I dont rate a guy like that.

645
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:00,576
Angel?

646
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,579
Be'side's, right now
'she's got elephant trainer trouble.

647
00:41:04,027 --> 00:41:05,255
Angel!

648
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:07,303
You better hurry.
That's not Sabu calling.

649
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:09,343
That's what I like about him.
He's 'so gentle.

650
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:11,816
Who want's them gentle?
I like them wild.

651
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:14,378
Oh, come on, birdie. Get going.

652
00:41:14,627 --> 00:41:15,980
Angel, come along!

653
00:41:32,947 --> 00:41:35,142
You 'should have 'seen Brad's face
when you took that tumble.

654
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:36,580
She wa's too bu'sy watching Seba'stian.

655
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:38,737
- Put your claw's away, girl's.
- Holly.

656
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,339
Gee, if all the Ranger's

00:41:41,427 --> 00:41:42,416

658
00:41:42,507 --> 00:41:43,940
You and plenty more, huh, Holly?

659
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:46,018
Look, all I want from him
i's the centre ring.

660
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:49,383
You alway's have a 'smile
for that high-flying peacock.

661
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:51,378
Well, what you want me to do,
cry over him?

662
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,185
I feel like a turret gunner.

663
00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:56,901
Made it.

664
00:41:58,147 --> 00:41:59,944
Okay, batten down the hatche's.

665
00:42:00,027 --> 00:42:01,745
Hey, Rich, get me a hot dog, will you?

666
00:42:01,827 --> 00:42:03,704
- We aint got time.
- Well, lm hungry!

A circu's 'serenade.

00:43:40,507 --> 00:43:41,735
Look at Pluto!

674
00:43:42,027 --> 00:43:43,426
Hi, Alice!

675
00:43:47,547 --> 00:43:49,742
Oh, and there's the Mad Hatter.
The Mad Hatter.

676
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:58,342
A Gay Ninetie's album.

677
00:44:21,187 --> 00:44:23,621
A moonlight 'serenade.

a's godde's's of the moon.

Nur'sery rhyme's.

681
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:43,696
The lady who taught you
your fir'st fairy tale,

682
00:44:44,067 --> 00:44:45,420
Mother Goo'se!

683
00:44:46,187 --> 00:44:47,859
She's big, i'snt 'she?

684
00:44:58,787 --> 00:45:00,778
A barber'shop ballad.

685
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:08,545
A bouquet of American beautie's,

00:45:41,387 --> 00:45:43,059
Gee, you have a funny mouth.

689
00:45:43,147 --> 00:45:45,456
- Let me hold him.
- Go away.

690
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:59,737
Look it. I'snt it pretty?

691
00:46:07,707 --> 00:46:10,585
Theyve been around again
a'sking que'stion's.

692
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:12,500
Im 'so worried for you.

693
00:46:12,587 --> 00:46:15,499
Oh, now dont worry.
Theyll never find me behind thi's no'se.

694
00:46:15,587 --> 00:46:16,736
Be very careful, dear.

695
00:46:16,827 --> 00:46:17,942
Now how about a nice 'smile

696
00:46:18,027 --> 00:46:20,097
that I can remember till next year?

697
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:22,380
God be with you, my boy.

698
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:24,025
It's all right, Mother.

699
00:46:25,627 --> 00:46:27,538
Only a rose

700
00:46:27,627 --> 00:46:29,026
Here we go!

701
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:33,782
Only a smile to keep in memory

702
00:46:33,867 --> 00:46:37,906
Until we meet another day

703
00:46:37,987 --> 00:46:41,900
Only a rose to whisper

704
00:46:41,987 --> 00:46:46,105
Blushing as roses do

705
00:46:46,187 --> 00:46:52,820
III bring along
a smile or a song for anyone

706
00:46:54,387 --> 00:47:00,860
Only a rose for you

707
00:47:13,187 --> 00:47:15,747
A Stephen Fo'ster album.

708
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:42,296
A South American album!

709
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:52,460
Exotic firebird's
from the fore'st's of the Amazon,

710
00:47:52,547 --> 00:47:55,619
a blaze of breathtaking beauty.

711
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:34,785
A very 'special 'surpri'se

712
00:48:34,867 --> 00:48:37,779
for children of all age's,

713
00:48:37,867 --> 00:48:40,506

00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:42,737
Hopalong Ca's'sidy!

715
00:48:45,187 --> 00:48:47,417
That's him! Sure, it's Hoppy!

716
00:49:00,347 --> 00:49:02,497
A Chri'stma's album.

717
00:49:02,587 --> 00:49:05,943
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

718
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:09,662
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

719
00:49:24,427 --> 00:49:26,736
Your hair i's too red,
your leg's are too thin,

720
00:49:26,827 --> 00:49:27,816
you have lip's like a cat.

721
00:49:27,907 --> 00:49:29,943
Youre no good.
You give me too much trouble.

722
00:49:30,027 --> 00:49:31,745
Flattery roll's right off me.

723
00:49:31,827 --> 00:49:33,738
But you make a fire here.

724
00:49:33,827 --> 00:49:36,819
Well, 'simmer down, General,
before you melt your medal's.

725
00:49:41,427 --> 00:49:44,863
What could be more fitting
for the Chri'stma's album

726
00:49:44,947 --> 00:49:47,780
than Adeste Fideles?

727
00:50:19,707 --> 00:50:21,743
The performance ends,

728
00:50:21,827 --> 00:50:23,738
but the drama never stops.

729
00:50:24,907 --> 00:50:27,216
In the grey, drizzly morning,

730
00:50:27,307 --> 00:50:31,266
the first section of the circus train
pulls into the railroad yard,

731
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:33,463
long before the city is awake.

732
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:37,496
But the animals are awake
and looking for their breakfast.

733
00:50:37,587 --> 00:50:39,657
Then comes the unloading.

734
00:50:39,747 --> 00:50:44,343
Two hundred tons of living power.
Sixty carloads of equipment.

735
00:50:45,507 --> 00:50:48,305
Wheels rolling, gears grinding.

736
00:50:48,387 --> 00:50:52,505
A circus is gigantic power
and unceasing movement.

737
00:50:53,307 --> 00:50:55,218
It is a restless giant,

738
00:50:55,307 --> 00:50:59,220
unlimbering its muscles
after the long night ride

739
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,946
before moving in to capture a new city.

740
00:51:03,267 --> 00:51:06,896
Up from the railroad yards
with their faithful escort

741
00:51:06,987 --> 00:51:11,060
of early-rising young fans
whove been waiting since daybreak

742
00:51:11,147 --> 00:51:13,342
to follow these living tanks

743
00:51:13,427 --> 00:51:16,817
as they lumber and sway
to the circus grounds,

744
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,820
where the stakes are being driven
that will anchor the big top

745
00:51:20,907 --> 00:51:23,785
against the beating
of its constant adversaries,

746
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:25,664
wind and rain.

747
00:51:25,747 --> 00:51:29,296
An army is at work,
an army the audience never sees.

748
00:51:30,107 --> 00:51:34,419
An army that must be moved
from city to city, fed and housed,

749
00:51:34,507 --> 00:51:37,579
a thousand strong, hardworking men,

750
00:51:37,667 --> 00:51:41,455
moving like a finely-geared machine,
with one purpose,

751
00:51:41,547 --> 00:51:43,060
to roll the show.

752
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:46,859
The all-important baling ring
clangs into place.

753
00:51:46,947 --> 00:51:51,543
Bales of fireproof canvas,
58,000 pounds of it,

754
00:51:51,627 --> 00:51:54,187
are hauled out, unwrapped, rolled out,

755
00:51:54,267 --> 00:51:56,861
stretched, laid on the ground,

756
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:01,145
where it lies like the skin
of a mighty dismembered giant,

757
00:52:01,227 --> 00:52:03,058
waiting for some magician

758
00:52:03,147 --> 00:52:06,219
to bring it together and give it life,

759
00:52:07,187 --> 00:52:09,576
waiting until, one by one,

760
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:12,977
the giants ribs rise into place

761
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:15,581
and are firmly fastened in the earth.

762
00:52:16,747 --> 00:52:20,581
Boys line up for the punt games,
a chance for a free ticket.

763
00:52:21,427 --> 00:52:25,306
The disciplined army never loses
a moment nor wastes a motion.

764
00:52:25,387 --> 00:52:29,665
The boss canvas man makes fast
the canvas to the baling ring.

765
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:32,215
The lives of all depend on it.

766
00:52:32,307 --> 00:52:35,583
Each of the hundreds of roustabouts
has his place and his job,

767
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:40,343
a responsible job, for one mistake,
one bit of carelessness,

768
00:52:40,427 --> 00:52:41,906
could cost a life.

769
00:52:41,987 --> 00:52:43,978
The giants skin is stretched out

770
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:47,059
until it lies smooth and moulded,

771
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,466
like the bowl of a great coliseum.

772
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:52,299
But eyes watching for trouble

773
00:52:52,387 --> 00:52:55,379
have noticed a little tear
that must be patched

774
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:58,300
before the searching fingers of the wind

775
00:52:58,387 --> 00:53:00,378
can rip it into a disaster,

776
00:53:00,987 --> 00:53:03,217
before the giant can stand up
and stretch

777
00:53:03,307 --> 00:53:06,060
over his feast of colour and laughter.

778
00:53:07,107 --> 00:53:09,575
Now the giant comes to life.

779
00:53:09,667 --> 00:53:12,704
Slowly, the tons and tons
of his canvas body

780
00:53:12,787 --> 00:53:14,823
rise and swell into the air.

781
00:53:15,707 --> 00:53:18,938
He starts growing to his full,
majestic height

782
00:53:19,027 --> 00:53:21,416
as he catches his first deep breath.

783
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:25,698
The strong baling rings
slipping along the great poles,

784
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:29,496
until at last they reach to the flags
flying from the peak.

785
00:53:30,947 --> 00:53:35,304
And as the big top rises in each town,
new risks are taken.

786
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:38,376
Caution is thrown to the winds

787
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:40,856
in this battle for the centre ring.

788
00:53:41,107 --> 00:53:44,577
...55, 56, 57, 58,

789
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:48,626
59, 60, 61,

790
00:53:48,707 --> 00:53:52,620
62, 63, 64,

791
00:53:52,707 --> 00:53:56,461
65, 66, 67,

792
00:53:56,547 --> 00:53:59,107
68, 69...

793
00:53:59,947 --> 00:54:02,745
I warned her not to do Jenny's act
on that rigging.

794
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:05,819
Yeah.
I wa's there the night Jenny got killed.

795
00:54:05,907 --> 00:54:09,582
...75, 76, 77,

796
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:13,626
78, 79, 80,

797
00:54:13,707 --> 00:54:17,586
81, 82, 83,

798
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:21,660
84, 85, 86,

799
00:54:21,747 --> 00:54:25,786
87, 88, 89,

800
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:29,780
90, 91, 92,

801
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:33,780
93, 94, 95,

802
00:54:33,867 --> 00:54:37,701
96, 97, 98...

803
00:54:38,387 --> 00:54:41,777
- Paying for the hay all in 'silver?
- That's how we get paid.

804
00:54:42,587 --> 00:54:44,578
Holly's 'spinning like a weathervane
in a Kan'sa's twi'ster.

805
00:54:44,667 --> 00:54:45,782
- Swingover's?
- Yeah.

806
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:47,016
Her rope i'snt rigged for that.

807
00:54:47,107 --> 00:54:48,460
Tell the ringma'ster
to whi'stle in The Zoppe's.

808
00:54:48,547 --> 00:54:49,536
- Fa'st.
- Right.

809
00:54:49,627 --> 00:54:53,063
...107, 108, 109,

810
00:54:53,147 --> 00:54:57,379
110, 111, 112...

811
00:54:57,467 --> 00:54:58,695
Come on.

812
00:54:58,867 --> 00:55:02,701
114, 115, 116,

813
00:55:02,787 --> 00:55:04,618
117...

814
00:55:04,707 --> 00:55:07,505
- What are they doing, Grandma?
- I dont know.

815
00:55:08,067 --> 00:55:11,946
121, 122, 123,

816
00:55:12,027 --> 00:55:13,142
124...

817
00:55:16,427 --> 00:55:18,224
Like a fi'sh on a line!

818
00:55:26,307 --> 00:55:27,706
The red rope!

819
00:55:40,107 --> 00:55:41,256
Hey, you!

820
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:43,497
You! Are you crazy?

821
00:55:43,587 --> 00:55:45,259
Hauling me down in front of everybody!

822
00:55:45,347 --> 00:55:48,464
Everybody laughing at me!
I wa's going for a record!

823
00:55:48,547 --> 00:55:49,582
What's the matter, are you jealou's?

824
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:51,976
Cant you 'stand to 'see me
work in the air anymore?

825
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:53,659
You cant do that trick on a pull-up rope.

826
00:55:53,747 --> 00:55:56,056
- I wa's doing it, wa'snt I?
- Get out of the way.

827
00:55:56,147 --> 00:55:59,378
A hurricane of hazardou's hor'seman'ship

828
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:02,061
di'splayed by the riding Zoppe's!

829
00:56:02,147 --> 00:56:04,297
Why didnt you put her over your knee
and 'spank her?

830
00:56:04,387 --> 00:56:06,582
That would get 'some laugh's, too.

831
00:56:07,027 --> 00:56:09,985
Havent you got enough clown's,
you got to make a comic out of her?

832
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:13,901
- She wa's trying to break a record.
- Shed have broken more than a record.

833
00:56:15,147 --> 00:56:17,183
You 'sure 'saved her a bu'ster.

834
00:56:17,787 --> 00:56:20,062
You better tell her, Brad,
or 'shell never forgive you.

835
00:56:35,147 --> 00:56:39,379
Alberto Zoppe and Cucciola,

836
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:42,618
world's 'smalle'st bareback rider!

837
00:58:33,627 --> 00:58:36,300
I would buy you 'spring violet's
from the little old lady

838
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:39,379
in the Place de IOpera
and crépe's 'suzette's.

839
00:58:39,947 --> 00:58:41,665
You never eaten them?

840
00:58:43,227 --> 00:58:46,617
Pari's i's a honeymoon city, chérie,
full of enchantment.

841
00:58:47,787 --> 00:58:51,177
On a night like thi's,
the Seine i's deep and my'steriou's,

842
00:58:51,267 --> 00:58:52,780
like a woman's eye's.

843
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:55,142
The light's in it are like jewel's.

844
00:58:55,707 --> 00:58:59,700
Did you know, chérie, in your eye's
there are light's like 'stardu'st?

845
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:03,346
No, but keep going.

846
00:59:03,427 --> 00:59:06,305
You are beautiful and exciting,
like wine.

847
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:08,779
You know women are like wine?

848
00:59:08,867 --> 00:59:14,305
Some are like 'sweet Sauterne's,
'some are warm like Burgundy, 'some...

849
00:59:14,387 --> 00:59:16,696
Which one wa's Angel?

850
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:19,985
- Angel?
- Angel.

851
00:59:20,907 --> 00:59:23,546
Angel wa's like cognac,

852
00:59:23,627 --> 00:59:25,697
all fire in a gla's's.

853
00:59:25,787 --> 00:59:27,186
But you...

854
00:59:27,987 --> 00:59:32,139
You are like champagne.
Sparkling, tantalizing.

855
00:59:32,707 --> 00:59:34,743
You make a man's head 'spin.

856
00:59:37,147 --> 00:59:41,504
- Youve got a terrific line.
- A line? What i's that?

857
00:59:41,587 --> 00:59:45,102
Well, I mean, youve 'said all thi's before
to too many girl's.

858
00:59:45,187 --> 00:59:47,257
Well, never to one like you.

859
00:59:48,107 --> 00:59:49,984
Oh, I have wandered a little.

860
00:59:50,827 --> 00:59:54,137
But how el'se could I appreciate
what I have found now?

861
00:59:55,107 --> 00:59:56,586
Id better go.

862
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:01,502
When we are up in the air,
I fall more and more in love.

863
01:00:01,587 --> 01:00:03,817
- You, too, no?
- No.

864
01:00:03,907 --> 01:00:07,217
A girl may 'say no,
but the woman in her mean's ye's.

865
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:11,266
- Do not be afraid of me.
- Im ju'st 'scared of my'self.

866
01:00:11,347 --> 01:00:14,180
It i's not of your'self.
It i's love that frighten's you.

867
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:16,827
Feel. My heart beat's fa'st like your's.

868
01:00:16,907 --> 01:00:20,786
- That's the magic of it. You love me.
- No. I mean, I dont know.

869
01:00:25,067 --> 01:00:27,058
Let me go! Seba'stian!

870
01:00:27,147 --> 01:00:29,456
Never try to take anything
from an elephant.

871
01:00:29,547 --> 01:00:31,344
Seba'stian, do 'something!

872
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:33,657
A lion, III fight for you. A tiger.

873
01:00:33,747 --> 01:00:36,580
But a redheaded wildcat
with an elephant, no.

874
01:00:39,267 --> 01:00:42,020
You make thi's two-tailed jacka's's
put me down!

875
01:00:42,107 --> 01:00:44,223
Did he tell you about Pari's
in the 'spring?

876
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,775
It's none of your bu'sine's's what he told...

877
01:00:46,867 --> 01:00:49,825
Did he 'say you were like cognac,
all fire in the gla's's?

878
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:53,024
No. He 'said I wa's like champagne.
I made hi's head 'spin.

879
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,575
Yeah, only youll be the one
that wake's up with a hangover.

880
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:57,976
You take care of your love life,
and III take care of mine.

881
01:00:58,067 --> 01:01:00,706
No, lve got four working here.
That's all.

882
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:03,142
Well, if youve got an elephant mi's'sing,
go find her.

883
01:01:03,227 --> 01:01:04,546
Joe, 'send into town.

884
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:07,095
They had a Republican convention
there tonight.

885
01:01:07,707 --> 01:01:10,540
Hold it. Here's your mi's'sing Jumbo.
It's okay.

886
01:01:10,987 --> 01:01:14,059
Come on, move it up, Ruth.
Come on. Move it up.

887
01:01:14,147 --> 01:01:15,182
You...

888
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:17,299
All right. Put her down.

889
01:01:17,387 --> 01:01:18,536
What's thi's, a new act?

890
01:01:18,627 --> 01:01:20,583
You nearly lo'st
your 'stray lamb to a wolf.

891
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:22,737
You know, youve got a no'se a's long
a's that elephant's trunk.

892
01:01:22,827 --> 01:01:24,260
Keep them both out of my bu'sine's's.

893
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,417
Theyre looking for thi's bull
down at the railroad yard.

894
01:01:26,507 --> 01:01:30,022
- Ruth ju'st couldnt re'si'st the hay pile.
- Id hate to have your nerve in a tooth.

895
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:33,019
Come on, 'sugar. Let's go. Come on.

896
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:35,496
I think your coffee's kind of cold.

897
01:01:39,107 --> 01:01:42,144
- Why did you do that, Holly?
- I dont know.

898
01:01:43,107 --> 01:01:45,177
There's ju'st 'something
about Seba'stian that I...

899
01:01:45,267 --> 01:01:48,179
Yeah, he's 'some glamour boy.

900
01:01:48,867 --> 01:01:51,256
He 'said I had 'stardu'st in my eye's.

901
01:01:53,187 --> 01:01:56,099
- I bet you never even noticed.
- Sure, I have.

902
01:01:56,187 --> 01:01:58,781
But you werent rigged
for that one-armed 'swing.

903
01:01:58,867 --> 01:02:01,222
I know, ju'st 'so the 'show keep's rolling.

904
01:02:01,307 --> 01:02:04,105
Come over here.
I want to 'show you 'something.

905
01:02:14,027 --> 01:02:16,222
Ju'st a few more 'spin's up there.

906
01:02:21,307 --> 01:02:24,265
- You wouldve lo'st a good act.
- One of the be'st.

907
01:02:25,347 --> 01:02:28,896
Now, look, Holly, I want you
to 'soft-pedal thi's 'stuff with Seba'stian.

908
01:02:28,987 --> 01:02:32,184
- You do, Brad? Why?
- It's gone too far.

909
01:02:32,907 --> 01:02:36,695
I gue's's youre right.
I have been playing with fire.

910
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:39,255
But it's all your fault.
If you werent 'such a big lug...

911
01:02:39,347 --> 01:02:42,498
Im talking about your act,
thi's duel or whatever you call it.

912
01:02:42,587 --> 01:02:45,181
I want you to 'stop it before you get hurt.

913
01:02:45,267 --> 01:02:48,020

914
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,697
- You.
- Brad, do you really mean that?

915
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:56,742
Why couldnt you 'say 'so?
Sure, III cut it out.

916
01:02:56,827 --> 01:02:59,261
But lve got pride.
Hell look better than me.

917
01:02:59,347 --> 01:03:02,498
- With a net under him?
- A net? Why a net?

918
01:03:02,587 --> 01:03:04,498
To 'save hi's expen'sive neck.

919
01:03:04,587 --> 01:03:08,375
- Well, I dont want a net.
- All right, then 'stick to the old act.

920
01:03:08,467 --> 01:03:11,743
Sure, Brad. Whatever you 'say.

921
01:03:11,827 --> 01:03:15,103
And when Seba'stian tone's down,
hi's net come's out, too.

922
01:03:16,027 --> 01:03:18,143
Now, you going to 'stop
fooling around up there?

923
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:19,546
Sure, Brad.

924
01:03:20,387 --> 01:03:22,503
- What about on the ground?
- On the ground?

925
01:03:22,587 --> 01:03:25,340
Oh, that remind's me,
Jeannie pulled her 'shoulder tonight.

926
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:26,985
Shell be on the ground for a while.

927
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:28,386
Will you fill in with the flyer's again?

928

Of cour'se, Brad,
but you were ju'st gonna 'say that...

929
01:03:30,387 --> 01:03:32,423
Line up that pole wagon! Swing it over!

930
01:03:32,507 --> 01:03:34,304
Brad, on the ground...

931
01:03:34,987 --> 01:03:39,105
- Do you want me to 'stop 'seeing him?
- On the ground? I...

933
01:03:49,267 --> 01:03:52,816
You left a little of your fragrance behind
with your 'scarf.

934
01:03:52,907 --> 01:03:55,057
May I e'scort you to the train?

01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:04,702
No?

938
01:04:05,827 --> 01:04:08,864
I think you have 'stardu'st
mixed up with 'sawdu'st.

939
01:04:08,947 --> 01:04:10,619
Good night, bo's's man.

01:04:11,907 --> 01:04:13,625
And on the ground,

941
01:04:15,387 --> 01:04:18,459
I wouldnt want to meddle

942
01:04:28,867 --> 01:04:31,620
To the right and left of the doorway.

943
01:04:35,387 --> 01:04:37,742
Pompom hat's, folk's. Step right up.

944
01:04:37,947 --> 01:04:39,983
Put your name on them,

your wife's name,
even your mother-in-law's name.

946
01:04:42,067 --> 01:04:45,616
Step right up, folk's. Get your
pompom hat's before you leave.

947
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:50,304
- For you, Liebchen, a pre'sent.
- Thank you, 'sugar.

948
01:04:51,987 --> 01:04:54,581
Straight from Pari's and twice a's cla's'sy.

949
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:57,701
- How doe's it look?
- It look's good.

950
01:04:57,787 --> 01:04:59,584
Read it, what it 'say's.

951
01:05:01,907 --> 01:05:04,944
Angel, du bist mein. What's it mean?

952
01:05:07,107 --> 01:05:08,426
You are mine.

953
01:05:09,267 --> 01:05:10,780
Li'sten, 'sugar, lm not your's.

954
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:13,176
And lm not wearing any hat
that 'say's 'so.

955
01:05:13,267 --> 01:05:14,541
The 'sooner you take no for an an'swer,

956
01:05:14,627 --> 01:05:18,302
the ea'sier it's gonna be for both of u's.
Becau'se it i's no.

957
01:05:18,387 --> 01:05:21,504
The only thing I like about you
are your elephant's.

958
01:05:22,067 --> 01:05:23,216
But, Angel...

959
01:05:23,307 --> 01:05:26,026
Want to win a baby doll?
Wi'se up. I know doll's.

960

Theyre my bu'sine's's.
Take's dough to get a dame like her.

961
01:05:28,787 --> 01:05:30,618
Her heart i's ice.

962
01:05:30,707 --> 01:05:33,346
She wouldnt 'say no
to a hunk of ice like thi's.

963
01:05:36,427 --> 01:05:37,746
But I could not buy 'such a thing.

964
01:05:37,827 --> 01:05:39,579
Go ahead, take it.
Your credit's okay with me.

965
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:41,339
- What's the matter, pal?
- My wallet's gone.

966
01:05:41,427 --> 01:05:42,496
Are you 'sure?

967
01:05:42,587 --> 01:05:44,418
I had the wallet in my pocket
when I wa's right here.

968
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:47,579
- And I had $10 in it.

969
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:50,465
- You mu'st be mi'staken, friend.
- Oh, no. I...

970
01:05:52,227 --> 01:05:54,183
Well, maybe I wa's.

971
01:05:56,707 --> 01:05:59,221
Harry, you make trouble.

Everybody play's, everybody win's.

Keep your eye on the arrow, folk's.

975
01:06:05,107 --> 01:06:08,099
Round and round it goe's
and where it 'stop's, nobody know's.

976
01:06:08,187 --> 01:06:10,747
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
Everybody play's.

977
01:06:50,147 --> 01:06:52,058
How did he get in there?

978
01:07:05,027 --> 01:07:07,495
Water's coming out of it.

979
01:07:07,587 --> 01:07:10,226
Look at that 'silly umbrella.

980
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:36,946
Sit down, Son.

You crazy devil,

989
01:09:14,907 --> 01:09:16,226

Look, youre holding up the act.

01:09:27,427 --> 01:09:29,895
I could 'swing with you forever like thi's.

993
01:09:29,987 --> 01:09:31,466
Why will you not 'see me anymore?

994
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:34,903
- Theyre waiting. Plea'se put me back.
- Not until you ki's's me.

995
01:09:34,987 --> 01:09:38,297
When I ki's's you, I need both feet

Seba'stian wont give up, Brad.

999
01:09:58,587 --> 01:10:00,657
You better marry me quick
or lm a gone pigeon.

1000
01:10:00,747 --> 01:10:03,705
You get back up there and fini'sh the act
or youll be a dead pigeon.

1001
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:04,981
Ye's, 'sir.

1002
01:10:17,987 --> 01:10:19,500
We got trouble on the midway.

1003
01:10:19,587 --> 01:10:21,896
- Harry?
- Yeah, hi's doll conce's'sion.

1004
01:10:23,067 --> 01:10:26,264
Get your'self a little 'spending money.
Here we go for another 'spin.

1005
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,099
The more you play, the more you win.

1006
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:31,259
- Let's go, Sam. You cant win at thi's.
- I got no more money anyhow.

1007
01:10:31,347 --> 01:10:35,340
Come on, mi'ster, you cant quit now.
Youre bound to hit it thi's time.

1008
01:10:35,427 --> 01:10:37,065
What do you think youre doing?
Let go of me.

1009
01:10:37,147 --> 01:10:40,344
- How much did you lo'se, lady?
- Thi's month's egg money, nearly $50.

1010
01:10:40,427 --> 01:10:41,826
Take thi's. Go on in and enjoy the 'show.

1011
01:10:41,907 --> 01:10:43,545
Get rid of the cu'stomer's, Joe.

1012
01:10:45,827 --> 01:10:47,783
Dont mix it, Brad. Youll get hurt.

1013
01:10:47,867 --> 01:10:51,098
- You know I run a clean 'show.
- Youre not running me!

1014
01:10:53,187 --> 01:10:55,576
Hey, did you 'see that?
Right in the ki's'ser!

1015
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:57,385
Hey, look out, Brad!

1016
01:11:01,107 --> 01:11:03,337
The bo's's finally caught you, huh?

1017
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:04,746
Nice going.

1018
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:11,336
Do you know who's backing me?

1019
01:11:11,427 --> 01:11:13,338
Yeah, and he's backing
your whole dirty 'setup.

1020
01:11:13,427 --> 01:11:14,860
Now get going.

1021
01:11:20,627 --> 01:11:24,506
The lu'sciou's Phylli's dance's and 'sing's

1022
01:11:24,587 --> 01:11:27,897
to the 'sultry 'south 'sea 'strain's

1023
01:11:27,987 --> 01:11:30,706
of Lovely Luawana Lady!

1024
01:12:07,587 --> 01:12:11,262
Lovely Luawana lady

1025
01:12:11,387 --> 01:12:15,539
When your hopes
and dreams grow fadey

1026
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:21,304
Dont you ever be afraid
He wont come back to you

1027
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:26,865
Lovely Luawana lady

1028
01:12:26,947 --> 01:12:30,064
Where those yukes
and jukes are played

1029
01:12:30,147 --> 01:12:33,662
He dreams of all the dreams he made

1030
01:12:33,747 --> 01:12:37,217
And longs that theyll come true

1031
01:12:37,307 --> 01:12:39,104
Ever since hes back

1032
01:12:39,187 --> 01:12:42,304
Theres been no lack of gals

1033
01:12:42,387 --> 01:12:44,264
But, gee, theyre slow

1034
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:48,703
They dont have that wicky wack

1035
01:12:48,787 --> 01:12:52,496
You taught him there
when the moon was low

1036
01:12:52,587 --> 01:12:57,297
Now every Susie, Sal, and Sadie

1037
01:12:57,387 --> 01:13:01,016
Just becomes a memory shady

1038
01:13:01,107 --> 01:13:04,497
Lovely Luawana lady

1039
01:13:04,587 --> 01:13:09,707
When he dreams of you

1040
01:14:42,027 --> 01:14:44,143
You made a mi'stake, Mr Braden,
a bad mi'stake,

1041
01:14:44,227 --> 01:14:45,455
throwing my game's off the lot.

1042
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:48,857
Theyre off, Mr Hender'son,
and they 'stay off.

1043
01:14:48,947 --> 01:14:51,256
It might 'save you a lot of trouble
if you let Harry come back.

1044
01:14:51,347 --> 01:14:54,180
Wherever you operate,
the midway's crawling with pickpocket's

1045
01:14:54,267 --> 01:14:55,825
and crooked gambling.

1046
01:14:55,907 --> 01:14:58,944
One rotten apple like you
can ruin a whole circu's.

1047
01:14:59,867 --> 01:15:01,505
You know, youre not 'so tough.

1048
01:15:01,587 --> 01:15:03,100
You wont 'stand a chance
fighting my outfit.

1049
01:15:03,187 --> 01:15:07,021
- Ive never run away from a fight yet.
- And lve never lo'st one.

1050
01:15:07,747 --> 01:15:10,466
There's no 'smoking allowed in here,
Mr Hender'son.

1051
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:13,937
Dont throw it away.
Ill 'show you the way out.

1052
01:16:18,947 --> 01:16:22,622
Lovely Luawana lady

1053
01:16:22,707 --> 01:16:26,177
When your hopes and dreams
grow fadey

1054
01:16:26,267 --> 01:16:29,225
Dont you ever be afraid

1055
01:16:29,307 --> 01:16:32,697
He wont come back to you

1056
01:16:32,787 --> 01:16:37,224
Now every Susie, Sal, and Sadie

1057
01:16:37,307 --> 01:16:40,538
Just becomes a memory shady

1058
01:16:40,627 --> 01:16:44,381
Lovely Luawana lady

1059
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:49,336
When he dreams of you

1060
01:17:01,307 --> 01:17:03,423
Are you afraid to 'speak to me?

1061
01:17:05,267 --> 01:17:08,976
The applau'se, the centre ring,
you do not try to 'steal them anymore.

1062
01:17:09,067 --> 01:17:12,104
I dont have to.
The only net I u'se i's in my hair.

1063
01:17:18,907 --> 01:17:23,219
- That net, it wa's the bo's's man's order's.
- Safety fir'st.

1064
01:17:23,307 --> 01:17:26,663
- Who can be 'safe near you?
- You can.

1065
01:17:27,707 --> 01:17:29,060
Ringma'ster?

1066
01:17:29,147 --> 01:17:32,457
I have a 'surpri'se for you.
I fly from the big rigging tonight.

1067
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:34,583
Oh, Mr Thomp'son, when I 'signal,
will you announce

1068
01:17:34,667 --> 01:17:39,024
that I will do a double forward
over the bar through a paper hoop.

1069
01:17:39,107 --> 01:17:40,984
- A double?
- Through a hoop?

1070
01:17:41,067 --> 01:17:42,625
Through a hoop.

1071
01:17:42,707 --> 01:17:44,698
That's not 'so much with a net
under you.

1072
01:17:44,787 --> 01:17:47,017
Stop it, you two. Youre on.

1073
01:17:50,827 --> 01:17:52,055
Chérie...

1074
01:17:54,547 --> 01:17:56,424
The net, it bother's you?

1075
01:18:00,587 --> 01:18:03,147
- You crazy fool!
- No net.

1076
01:18:03,227 --> 01:18:04,945
Thank you, my friend.

1077
01:18:05,707 --> 01:18:08,938
Ladie's and gentlemen,

1078
01:18:09,027 --> 01:18:11,939
the 'sen'sation of the age's!

1079
01:18:15,587 --> 01:18:16,906
In ring one,

1080
01:18:16,987 --> 01:18:21,265
the beautiful and 'spectacular
queen of the flying trapeze,

1081
01:18:21,347 --> 01:18:23,736
the incredible Holly!

1082
01:18:23,827 --> 01:18:26,057
And in the centre ring,

1083
01:18:26,147 --> 01:18:30,186
the out'standing aerial daredevil
of all time,

1084
01:18:30,267 --> 01:18:34,818
the debonair king of the air,
The Great Seba'stian!

1085
01:18:38,707 --> 01:18:39,856
No net.

1086
01:20:18,907 --> 01:20:21,375
And now, for the fir'st time

1087
01:20:21,467 --> 01:20:23,822
in thi's or any other circu's,

1088
01:20:24,427 --> 01:20:28,898
The Great Seba'stian will attempt
a double 'somer'sault

1089
01:20:28,987 --> 01:20:31,945
over the bar, through a hoop,

1090
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:36,100
'scorning a net
or any other 'safety device.

1091
01:20:37,587 --> 01:20:39,179
Hope he make's it.

1092
01:20:45,227 --> 01:20:48,583
Seba'stian, no!
Dont try it without the net!

1093
01:20:53,787 --> 01:20:54,822
Who took that net down?

1094
01:20:54,907 --> 01:20:57,626
- He did. You want it up again?
- It's too late now. He's ready to go.

1095
01:21:15,587 --> 01:21:16,906
Go on, now.

1096
01:21:18,067 --> 01:21:19,420
Keep the 'show rolling.

1097
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:21,498
Roll up thi's net. Clown's!

1098
01:21:21,587 --> 01:21:23,942
Holly, keep it going. Go into your 'swing.

1099
01:21:24,627 --> 01:21:25,662
No.

1100
01:21:30,627 --> 01:21:31,946
Walk me off.

1101
01:21:34,307 --> 01:21:36,537
Do not rob me of my exit.

1102
01:21:37,507 --> 01:21:38,656
All right.

1103
01:21:38,747 --> 01:21:42,023
Your arm, bo's's man. Your 'strong arm.

1104
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:43,301
Ea'sy now.

1105
01:21:56,667 --> 01:21:58,658
Keep your 'seat's, plea'se!

1106
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:02,501
The Great Seba'stian i's 'shaken
but not badly hurt.

1107
01:22:02,587 --> 01:22:05,784
The performance i's now continuing!

1108
01:22:05,867 --> 01:22:08,620
Re'sume your 'seat's! Plea'se!

1109
01:22:33,307 --> 01:22:36,105
- Birdie, i's he dead?
- No, I dont think 'so.

1110
01:22:38,227 --> 01:22:39,660
Draw it back.

1111
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,305
- Carefully now.
- All right.

1112
01:22:42,387 --> 01:22:45,060
Back to wardrobe, girl's.
Back to wardrobe.

1113
01:22:46,867 --> 01:22:49,142
- Will he be all right, Doc?
- He's lucky to be alive.

1114
01:22:49,227 --> 01:22:50,546
- Thank's for the help, Button's.
- Okay.

1115
01:22:50,627 --> 01:22:52,902
Where did you ever learn
to do a Velpeau bandage?

1116
01:22:53,507 --> 01:22:55,702
Well, you learn a lot
when youre a pharmaci'st's mate.

1117
01:22:55,787 --> 01:22:58,301
You mu'stve been the be'st in the Navy.

1118
01:23:03,867 --> 01:23:05,539
Gee, he's hurt bad.

1119
01:23:08,347 --> 01:23:09,382
The other way. Turn him around.

1120
01:23:09,467 --> 01:23:11,423
Dont tran'sfer him.
Ju'st leave him on thi's 'stretcher.

1121
01:23:11,507 --> 01:23:12,781
Seba'stian!

1122
01:23:14,067 --> 01:23:17,343
Of all the crazy thing's.
Why did you do it?

1123
01:23:18,347 --> 01:23:21,339
I didnt mean for it to happen like thi's.

1124
01:23:21,427 --> 01:23:23,657
Only he would try
'such a wonderful trick.

1125
01:23:23,747 --> 01:23:27,376
- And you almo'st did it.
- I will do it. The next time.

1126
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:28,820
Sure, you will.

1127
01:23:28,907 --> 01:23:31,421
And when you come back,
youll 'stand them on their ear's.

1128
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:34,704
When I come back, chérie, you will fall.
For me.

1129
01:23:34,787 --> 01:23:38,462
All right, get him in there.
Let's get 'started. Get a move on.

1130
01:23:46,427 --> 01:23:47,621
Oh, Brad.

1131
01:23:51,307 --> 01:23:54,538
Flyer's have fallen before.
They will again.

1132
01:23:55,867 --> 01:23:57,585
He wont die, pigeon.

1133
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,776
Your rig goe's in centre ring tomorrow.

1134
01:24:01,867 --> 01:24:04,586
But I didnt want it like thi's,

1135
01:24:04,907 --> 01:24:06,818
not over hi's broken body.

1136
01:24:13,547 --> 01:24:18,382
Under the big top, only two days count,
today and tomorrow.

1137
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:23,544
The circus rolls on
whether flyers rise or flyers fall.

1138
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:25,861
And week after week,

1139
01:24:25,947 --> 01:24:29,383
new audiences laugh
at the antics of the clowns

1140
01:24:29,467 --> 01:24:33,506
and thrill to incredible feats
of skill and daring.

1141
01:25:12,547 --> 01:25:15,983
Hot roa'sted peanut's. Peanut's.
Get them while theyre hot.

1142
01:25:31,947 --> 01:25:33,858
Hot roa'sted peanut's.

1143
01:25:33,947 --> 01:25:35,460
I cant watch it.

1144
01:27:28,747 --> 01:27:30,180
Higher, higher!

1145
01:27:30,867 --> 01:27:34,496
- Take another crack at it, Holly.
- Higher thi's time. Sky's the limit.

1146
01:27:34,907 --> 01:27:36,545
Play it, Emmett. Give me 'some rhythm.

1147
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:38,504
Yeah, maybe thatll help.

1148
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:39,940
Well, whi'stle or 'something.

1149
01:27:40,027 --> 01:27:42,860
- Anybody got a lemon?
- You think thatll work?

1150
01:27:44,827 --> 01:27:46,738
- Start your jug band.
- Noodle it up.

1151
01:27:46,827 --> 01:27:49,500
- Give it plenty of bounce!
- Yeah, pick it up, Ed.

1152
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:53,580
Hit it, Holly!

1153
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:57,537
When things go wrong
and lifes no song

1154
01:27:57,627 --> 01:28:00,016
And youre flat on your back

1155
01:28:01,027 --> 01:28:04,144
That doesnt mean you have to lie there

1156
01:28:04,227 --> 01:28:06,297
Be a jumpinjack

1157
01:28:07,307 --> 01:28:10,344
Keep on the hop and if you flop

1158
01:28:10,427 --> 01:28:13,578
In every single plan

1159
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:16,898
Stand on your head and holler,
Hi, there

1160
01:28:16,987 --> 01:28:19,137
Be a jumpinjack

1161
01:28:19,947 --> 01:28:23,064
When things go up
They must come down

1162
01:28:23,147 --> 01:28:26,219
And also vice-a verse

1163
01:28:26,307 --> 01:28:29,344
If things look bad, dont fret and frown

1164
01:28:29,427 --> 01:28:31,463
They could be ten times worse

1165
01:28:31,547 --> 01:28:32,582
Get Emmett!

1166
01:28:32,667 --> 01:28:34,180
Your train of luck

1167
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:35,666
It may get stuck

1168
01:28:35,747 --> 01:28:38,898
If somethings on the track

1169
01:28:38,987 --> 01:28:40,056
Take a good jump

1170
01:28:40,147 --> 01:28:41,978
And youll get by there

1171
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:44,900
Be a jumpinjack

1172
01:28:57,707 --> 01:28:59,937

Ill bet they took plenty in you.

1176

Vita, dont eat too much.
Youll break your 'si'ster's pretty neck.

1182
01:29:30,507 --> 01:29:33,226
Well, if it i'snt Superman!

1183
01:29:33,307 --> 01:29:36,265
- Something will get burned.
- It 'sure will.

1184
01:29:39,747 --> 01:29:43,183
If you play with fire, you get burned.
I 'still have my 'scar.

1185
01:29:43,867 --> 01:29:47,257
Brad! Oh, Brad! Seba'stian's back!

Cucciola!

1188
01:29:57,387 --> 01:29:59,139
Say, it look's like the ho'spital
agreed with you.

1189
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,376
So did the nur'se's.

1190
01:30:00,467 --> 01:30:02,458
- Hi, Seba'stian.

1191
01:30:02,547 --> 01:30:03,821

Hey, good to 'see you.

Maybe III borrow five more.

1195
01:30:11,227 --> 01:30:13,422
Seba'stian, it 'sure wa'snt the 'same
without you, fella.

1196
01:30:13,507 --> 01:30:16,101
Hello. I practi'sed 'somer'sault's
in my bed every day.

1197
01:30:16,187 --> 01:30:18,337
But did you do any bed'spring's?

Why i's it whenever he's around
lm all wet?

1199
01:30:21,627 --> 01:30:23,379
In more way's than one.

1200
01:30:25,387 --> 01:30:28,265
If you should slip and lose your grip

1201
01:30:28,347 --> 01:30:31,623
Get up and bounce right back

1202
01:30:31,707 --> 01:30:34,016
Act just like a rubber ball...

1203
01:30:34,107 --> 01:30:35,938
Look, Holly! Seba'stian!

It wa's a wonderful ho'spital.
And 'such nur'se's, too.

1217
01:31:07,867 --> 01:31:10,540
And we were worried about thi's big lug.

1218
01:31:10,627 --> 01:31:11,980
Thi's call's for a celebration.

1219
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:14,979
He came back when he heard
how good you were in the centre ring.

1220
01:31:15,067 --> 01:31:16,420
I wa's ju'st keeping it warm for you.

1221
01:31:16,507 --> 01:31:19,021
- I do not want it.
- Why not?

1222
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:21,746
- You dont want the centre ring back?
- Why not?

1223
01:31:21,827 --> 01:31:24,022
Becau'se I ju'st came back
to collect my thing's.

1224
01:31:24,827 --> 01:31:26,021
What for?

1225
01:31:26,827 --> 01:31:28,704

- No, thank you.

1226
01:31:29,187 --> 01:31:31,098
Collect your...

1227
01:31:31,187 --> 01:31:32,905
Now I know he's kidding.

1228
01:31:34,387 --> 01:31:36,821
No, no.
I dropped over at the Columbia 'show.

1229
01:31:36,907 --> 01:31:38,386
Columbia?

1230
01:31:38,467 --> 01:31:41,061
Weve been fighting them in every town
'since you left.

1231
01:31:42,587 --> 01:31:45,260
I ran into 'somebody over there
I had not 'seen 'since Pari's,

1232
01:31:45,347 --> 01:31:47,338
and very charming.

1233
01:31:48,987 --> 01:31:51,057
You know how it i's.
The'se thing's happen.

1234
01:31:51,947 --> 01:31:53,938
No. What happen's?

1235
01:31:54,027 --> 01:31:57,576
You know.
A pearl lo'se's it's lu'ster in time.

1236
01:31:58,507 --> 01:32:00,702
Champagne goe's flat, doe'snt it?

1237
01:32:00,787 --> 01:32:04,143
Even the blond bubbling kind
goe's flat very quickly.

1238
01:32:05,947 --> 01:32:07,938
Well, I will get my gear and rigging.

1239
01:32:08,027 --> 01:32:09,665
You dont plan to work for Columbia,
do you?

1240
01:32:09,747 --> 01:32:12,386
Let him go, Brad.
He's found 'some more 'stardu'st.

1241
01:32:12,467 --> 01:32:13,661
No, he ha'snt.

1242
01:32:13,747 --> 01:32:16,944
Chérie, I return you to 'sawdu'st.
Sawdu'st to 'sawdu'st.

1243
01:32:17,027 --> 01:32:19,700
You wouldnt work for Columbia.
Youre The Great Seba'stian.

1244
01:32:19,787 --> 01:32:22,506
You wouldnt give up the centre ring
for anything or anybody,

1245
01:32:22,587 --> 01:32:24,100
unle's's you couldnt hold it.

1246
01:32:24,187 --> 01:32:26,337
Youve been lying
ever 'since you came in here.

1247
01:32:26,427 --> 01:32:29,225
- Now let's 'see the truth.
- Keep your hand's off...

1248
01:32:31,227 --> 01:32:35,061
- You 'should not have done that.
- That's why you wouldnt 'shake hand's.

1249
01:32:44,107 --> 01:32:46,223
You werent going to Columbia.

1250
01:32:47,267 --> 01:32:49,542
There wa'snt any girl from Pari's.

1251
01:32:50,467 --> 01:32:52,185
You ju'st didnt want me to know...

1252
01:32:53,387 --> 01:32:55,457
To know what Id done.

1253
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:02,305
No, no, no, chérie.
You have done nothing.

1254
01:33:03,547 --> 01:33:04,866
It i's life.

1255
01:33:06,667 --> 01:33:08,339
No one i's to blame.

1256
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:14,302
- Cant 'something be done?
- No. They have tried.

1257
01:33:18,347 --> 01:33:20,065
May I have my coat, plea'se?

1258
01:33:20,147 --> 01:33:23,617
There's a job for you in thi's 'show
a's long a's you want it.

1259
01:33:24,267 --> 01:33:27,065
One more cripple hanging on
to the circu's?

1260
01:33:27,147 --> 01:33:31,379
Watching other's flying through the air
while I am crawling on the ground?

1261
01:33:32,467 --> 01:33:34,503
You are meaning to be kind, bo's's man,

1262
01:33:34,587 --> 01:33:37,385
but you and I both know
it i's better that I go.

1263
01:33:39,547 --> 01:33:40,582
Dont let him go, Brad!

1264
01:33:40,667 --> 01:33:44,182
Holly, he's grounded for good.
Hell go crazy if he 'stay's.

1265
01:33:48,307 --> 01:33:51,219
- I did that to him.
- No, he took the chance.

1266
01:33:52,067 --> 01:33:55,503
I did it to him,
a's 'surely a's if Id 'shot him.

1267
01:33:55,587 --> 01:33:58,977
- You had nothing to do with it.
- Oh, ye's, I did, Brad.

1268
01:33:59,067 --> 01:34:00,864
I made him take that net down.

1269
01:34:00,947 --> 01:34:05,225
I laughed at him. I razzed him into it.
That's what made him take it down!

1270
01:34:05,627 --> 01:34:08,187
You two crazy fool's.

1271
01:34:10,467 --> 01:34:12,264
He wa's top's in the air.

1272
01:34:13,907 --> 01:34:18,059
Now he's tied to a dead arm
for the re'st of hi's life,

1273
01:34:19,147 --> 01:34:20,466
a claw hand.

1274
01:34:21,707 --> 01:34:25,336
- It wouldve been kinder if Id killed him.
- Holly, thi's i's circu's.

1275
01:34:25,427 --> 01:34:29,056
Brad, you cant reali'se
what it mean's not to go up there again.

1276
01:34:29,147 --> 01:34:30,819
Maybe I can.

1277
01:34:30,907 --> 01:34:32,625
That's why it's better to let him go.

1278
01:34:32,707 --> 01:34:35,141
- Lf he goe's, lm going with him.
- Holly, dont be a fool!

1279
01:34:35,227 --> 01:34:38,981
You 'saw the way he hid hi's arm,
'said thing's to make me hate him.

1280
01:34:40,347 --> 01:34:43,305
He 'said them
becau'se he didnt want me to know...

1281
01:34:43,387 --> 01:34:45,582
To know that Id 'sma'shed him,

1282
01:34:46,107 --> 01:34:47,938
'sma'shed hi's whole life.

1283
01:34:49,547 --> 01:34:53,620
He didnt want me to know
becau'se he love's me.

1284
01:34:53,707 --> 01:34:55,459
And lve got to make it up to him
for what lve done.

1285
01:34:55,547 --> 01:34:56,616
All right, you 'sma'shed him.

1286
01:34:56,707 --> 01:34:59,505
Do you think 'sma'shing all three of u's
will help him?

1287
01:34:59,587 --> 01:35:01,384
You dont need me, Brad.

1288
01:35:01,467 --> 01:35:03,025
Youve got what you love.

1289
01:35:03,107 --> 01:35:05,382
Youve got the circu's.
But what's he got?

1290
01:35:05,467 --> 01:35:08,584
He's got gut's. That guy's tough.
He doe'snt need 'sympathy.

1291
01:35:08,667 --> 01:35:11,420
He can take thi's if you leave him alone.
He doe'snt need pity.

1292
01:35:11,507 --> 01:35:13,702
Im not going to give him pity.

1293
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:17,704
Im going to try and give him love.

1294
01:35:25,827 --> 01:35:26,862
Yeah?

1295
01:35:29,547 --> 01:35:30,821
All right.

1296
01:36:00,427 --> 01:36:03,305
- What do you want?
- To help you.

1297
01:36:03,387 --> 01:36:05,378
I dont want any help.
I dont need any help.

1298
01:36:05,467 --> 01:36:08,300
You come here to cry over me,
go 'somewhere el'se. I am packing.

1299
01:36:08,387 --> 01:36:10,582
You dont even know
where youre going.

1300
01:36:10,667 --> 01:36:13,545
Be'side's, wherever it i's,
what could you do

1301
01:36:13,627 --> 01:36:15,299
that you couldnt do here
with me to help you?

1302
01:36:15,387 --> 01:36:17,059
What do think you could do for me?

1303
01:36:17,147 --> 01:36:19,707
Well, I could fold thi's cape
a little better.

1304
01:36:19,787 --> 01:36:22,017
Oh, I 'see. Now lm a cripple.

1305
01:36:22,107 --> 01:36:23,904
You would dre's's me, undre's's me,

1306
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:26,660
wait on me like a little child.
No, thank you.

1307
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:28,977
If you want to be kind, plea'se go.

1308
01:36:29,067 --> 01:36:30,819
I want to be with you, wherever you are.

1309
01:36:30,907 --> 01:36:33,660
You are lying. You are 'sorry for me.

1310
01:36:33,747 --> 01:36:36,386
You want to pay me becau'se
you tea'sed me to cut down the net!

1311
01:36:36,467 --> 01:36:37,616
That i'snt true.

1312
01:36:37,707 --> 01:36:42,019
You fell in love with me when I wa's
The Great Seba'stian, king in the air,

1313
01:36:42,107 --> 01:36:45,065
a fla'sh of lightning in the centre ring.

1314
01:36:45,147 --> 01:36:48,298
On the ground,
it i's 'someone el'se you love.

1315
01:36:48,387 --> 01:36:49,900
That's all over.

1316
01:36:52,827 --> 01:36:54,624
Go back to the bo's's man.

1317
01:36:54,707 --> 01:36:56,663
Dont think I am fini'shed
becau'se of thi's.

1318
01:36:56,747 --> 01:36:58,499
If I want 'someone, III a'sk her my'self.

1319
01:36:58,587 --> 01:37:01,659
Women are no problem for me.
I find them anywhere.

1320
01:37:02,747 --> 01:37:04,783
You came back becau'se you love me.

1321
01:37:08,347 --> 01:37:10,497
You would like to believe that,
wouldnt you?

1322
01:37:10,587 --> 01:37:11,781
It wa's for thi's I came back.

1323
01:37:11,867 --> 01:37:13,539
- You did not.
- My rig.

1324
01:37:15,187 --> 01:37:17,223
Well, I can 'sell it anyway.

1325
01:37:18,627 --> 01:37:22,142
You 'should be dre's'sing for the 'show.
The applau'se, it i's all your's now.

1326
01:37:22,227 --> 01:37:23,262
Youve got the centre ring.

1327
01:37:23,507 --> 01:37:27,341
I cant take it away from you.
I cant even applaud you properly.

1328
01:37:27,627 --> 01:37:29,663
Say anything you like.

1329
01:37:29,747 --> 01:37:31,385
Hit me if you want.

1330
01:37:32,107 --> 01:37:36,419
- It wont change the way I feel.
- Maybe I would like to hit you for lying.

1331
01:37:41,547 --> 01:37:43,777
No one i's to blame but me. I...

1332
01:37:44,547 --> 01:37:47,937
- Plea'se, I mu'st hurry.
- Youre not going.

1333
01:37:48,027 --> 01:37:52,020
Youre tied to the circu's, and whether
you like it or not, youre tied to me.

1334
01:37:52,427 --> 01:37:54,657
You think I would tie you to thi's?

1335
01:37:56,747 --> 01:37:59,022
It wa'snt your arm I fell in love with.

1336
01:38:00,467 --> 01:38:01,866
Or your hand.

1337
01:38:02,587 --> 01:38:04,418
I fell in love with you.

1338
01:38:05,107 --> 01:38:07,621
Id give my other arm
if I could believe you.

1339
01:38:08,307 --> 01:38:10,980
What doe's a girl have to 'say
to make a blind man 'see?

1340
01:38:11,067 --> 01:38:14,298
Say that youll 'stay,
that youll never leave me, ever.

1341
01:38:14,867 --> 01:38:18,177
Thi's i's not
becau'se you are 'sorry for me?

1342
01:38:19,667 --> 01:38:21,783
You bet your life lm 'sorry for you.

1343
01:38:22,667 --> 01:38:24,623
Youre 'stuck with a blonde,

1344
01:38:24,747 --> 01:38:26,658
and youll never get away.

1345
01:38:27,347 --> 01:38:31,056
Chérie, how I would love you.

1346
01:38:34,387 --> 01:38:36,105
Hey, wait for me, Anita!

1347
01:38:49,227 --> 01:38:50,660
Step it up kid's, were on.

1348
01:38:50,747 --> 01:38:52,863
- I's my hat okay?
- Nobody's gonna 'see you.

1349
01:38:52,947 --> 01:38:54,938
Keep your coop to your'self today.

1350
01:38:58,987 --> 01:39:00,625
Picnic in the park.

1351
01:39:14,827 --> 01:39:19,378
A regal cavalcade
with Queen Marie Antoinette

1352
01:39:19,467 --> 01:39:23,506
and her gay court
at the royal hor'se 'show.

1353
01:39:29,387 --> 01:39:31,662
Remember,
youre 'suppo'sed to be a queen.

1354
01:40:42,907 --> 01:40:45,296
Youre for the bird's, that's for 'sure.

1355
01:40:45,387 --> 01:40:48,345
Giving up your life to Seba'stian
becau'se he's wa'shed up.

1356
01:40:48,427 --> 01:40:50,463
Who do you think you are?
Joan of Arc or 'somebody?

1357
01:40:50,547 --> 01:40:52,185
What doe's it matter to you what I do?

1358
01:40:52,267 --> 01:40:56,021
Go ahead. Play noble. That halo
i's gonna 'slip, 'sugar. It's phoney.

1359
01:40:56,107 --> 01:40:57,426
Itll be around your neck.

1360
01:40:57,507 --> 01:40:59,463
Where would you wear your's?

1361
01:41:02,587 --> 01:41:05,101
Say, why are you 'so 'steamed up
about me and Seba'stian?

1362
01:41:05,187 --> 01:41:06,461
Seba'stian?

1363
01:41:06,707 --> 01:41:09,016
I dont care
if you break him up for firewood.

1364
01:41:09,107 --> 01:41:11,177
He a'sked for it, playing around with you.

1365
01:41:11,267 --> 01:41:14,065
But Brad's on the level.
He didnt have thi's coming to him.

1366
01:41:14,147 --> 01:41:15,819
Brad ha'snt got time for love.

1367
01:41:15,907 --> 01:41:18,467
- Okay, III take Brad the way he i's.
- That i's, if youre hi's type.

1368
01:41:18,547 --> 01:41:20,458
Who are you calling a type?

1369
01:41:21,187 --> 01:41:24,099
Maybe I have been over the cour'se
a few too many time's.

1370
01:41:24,187 --> 01:41:27,020
But lve got a heart under thi's co'stume
with room in it for one guy.

1371
01:41:27,107 --> 01:41:29,905
You bu'sted him apart,
and lm gonna pick up the piece's.

1372
01:41:29,987 --> 01:41:31,978
Hell never mi's's you, 'sugar.

1373
01:41:32,147 --> 01:41:34,866
Im going to give him
more than you ever could.

1374
01:41:34,947 --> 01:41:37,586
Maybe 'so.
Youve had plenty of experience.

1375
01:42:53,827 --> 01:42:54,976
Youll never make it.

1376
01:42:55,067 --> 01:42:56,466
- Did you 'see him?
- No. Where?

1377
01:42:56,547 --> 01:42:58,060
Here's your toothpick!

1378
01:43:48,267 --> 01:43:52,658
When the lights go out on this
glittering realm of sawdust and popcorn,

1379
01:43:52,747 --> 01:43:56,865
the circus puts off its spangles
and climbs into battle dress

1380
01:43:56,947 --> 01:43:59,620
for the nightly combat
with time and distance.

1381
01:44:00,747 --> 01:44:04,899
The tear-down is a wild tangle
of man, machine and beast,

1382
01:44:05,147 --> 01:44:07,707
an orderly disorder of ropes

1383
01:44:07,787 --> 01:44:10,859
and metal poles and steel cable

1384
01:44:11,107 --> 01:44:12,984
and tons of heavy canvas.

1385
01:44:13,747 --> 01:44:15,897
Yet out of this apparent chaos,

1386
01:44:16,467 --> 01:44:18,776
these people bring tomorrows show,

1387
01:44:19,187 --> 01:44:21,542
fresh and new and gay and hot,

1388
01:44:22,387 --> 01:44:27,097
no matter how tangled
the skein of their own lives may be.

1389
01:44:27,347 --> 01:44:30,657
Ruth! Dont eat them new'spaper's!

1390
01:44:31,227 --> 01:44:33,104
I told you to leave them lay.

1391
01:44:33,507 --> 01:44:35,065
No, no, Ruth, Ruth.

1392
01:44:35,147 --> 01:44:36,944
Youll get a tummy ache.

1393
01:44:37,347 --> 01:44:39,542
She like's the candy that i's 'stuck to it.

1394
01:44:55,787 --> 01:44:57,903
He killed the thing he loved.

1395
01:44:59,907 --> 01:45:01,340
Button's, look.

1396
01:45:01,867 --> 01:45:05,064
- You 'said that.
- Did I?

1397
01:45:06,227 --> 01:45:08,866
Well, dont believe everything you hear.

1398
01:45:09,427 --> 01:45:11,258
And only half of what you 'see.

1399
01:45:24,187 --> 01:45:25,586
I can believe that.

1400
01:45:25,747 --> 01:45:28,784
So you 'see, chérie?
All men are alike except...

1401
01:45:28,867 --> 01:45:30,220
I know. Except you.

1402
01:45:30,307 --> 01:45:32,298
Come on, let's go down to the car.

1403
01:45:39,267 --> 01:45:40,382
Hello?

1404
01:45:41,107 --> 01:45:42,222

1405
01:45:42,547 --> 01:45:44,026

Yeah, he's 'staying with the 'show.

1409
01:45:53,787 --> 01:45:55,140
No, he cant.

1410
01:45:55,707 --> 01:45:58,824
Not hi's old act, but he's in the 'show.

1411
01:45:59,307 --> 01:46:00,456
Me?

1412
01:46:01,387 --> 01:46:03,105
Why do you a'sk that?

1413
01:46:03,227 --> 01:46:05,343
There's nothing wrong with me.

1414
01:46:05,747 --> 01:46:07,624
Bu'sine's's i's holding up fine.

1415

The advance 'sale i's fine.

1416

Everything's fine.

1417
01:46:11,747 --> 01:46:14,307
And were a cinch to keep
going the full 'sea'son.

1418
01:46:14,387 --> 01:46:15,422
Yeah.

1419
01:46:15,867 --> 01:46:17,380
So long, Johnny.

1420
01:46:17,627 --> 01:46:19,936
- The full 'sea'son? That's great.
- Yeah.

1421
01:46:21,267 --> 01:46:23,144
Arent you in the wrong wagon?

1422
01:46:23,227 --> 01:46:24,979
Not the way thi's one look's.

1423
01:46:25,347 --> 01:46:28,942
- Dont touch that.
- A bra's's hat.

1424
01:46:29,467 --> 01:46:31,139
What's all thi's hou'sekeeping?

1425
01:46:31,227 --> 01:46:32,819
Ju'st hou'sekeeping.

1426

Well, go do it 'someplace el'se.
The boy's take care of all thi's.

1432
01:46:55,067 --> 01:46:57,786
- Dont bother.
- Sweet?

1433
01:47:00,347 --> 01:47:01,985
Oh. Medium.

1434
01:47:08,827 --> 01:47:12,342
- What do you think youre doing?
- Packing your pipe.

1435
01:47:15,347 --> 01:47:16,939
Well, dont look 'so worried.

1436
01:47:17,027 --> 01:47:19,461
You never know what youre gonna
like until you try it.

1437
01:47:19,547 --> 01:47:20,582
I...

1438
01:47:30,427 --> 01:47:31,496
Well,

1439
01:47:33,147 --> 01:47:34,705

1440
01:47:34,907 --> 01:47:36,943
I u'sed to fill my dad's pipe.

1441
01:47:38,627 --> 01:47:40,936
I dont remember 'seeing you before.

1442
01:47:41,707 --> 01:47:44,062
You didnt. You only looked at me.

1443
01:47:44,147 --> 01:47:45,865
Now, what wa's that name again?

1444
01:47:45,947 --> 01:47:49,019
Minnie Mou'se.
Even elephant's are afraid of me.

1445
01:47:49,387 --> 01:47:52,299
Theyre 'smart animal's.
Women are poi'son.

1446
01:47:52,427 --> 01:47:54,099
But it's a wonderful death.

1447
01:47:59,227 --> 01:48:01,138
Im not dangerou's. Hone'st.

1448
01:48:01,907 --> 01:48:04,546
I ju'st think a guy in trouble
feel's better if...

1449
01:48:04,747 --> 01:48:06,658
Well, if there's a woman around.

1450
01:48:07,267 --> 01:48:09,223

1451
01:48:14,707 --> 01:48:18,666
- Well, dont you want 'some coffee?
- Sure, 'sugar.

1452
01:48:20,187 --> 01:48:22,018
That's what I came for.

1453
01:48:26,507 --> 01:48:29,704
You know,
I never knew a woman could fill a pipe.

1454
01:48:33,227 --> 01:48:36,264
Head's up! Big wagon coming through!

1455
01:48:55,107 --> 01:48:58,224
Hello, 'sucker.
How long you gonna take it?

01:48:58,547 --> 01:49:01,300
- Pretty picture, aint it?
- Shut up.

1457
01:49:01,387 --> 01:49:02,945

Why?
Becau'se he can give her pre'sent's.

01:49:05,027 --> 01:49:07,336
He's got the dough, 'so he get's the girl.

Not without dough. But we can get it.

1462

Get with it.
Youve got four and a half minute's.

01:51:38,427 --> 01:51:41,703
Minyak, 'see how
our angel's eye's 'shine today.

1487
01:51:41,787 --> 01:51:43,345
She ha's found a new love.

01:51:43,427 --> 01:51:45,622
Quit clowning, 'sugar.
For thi's I dont get paid by the hour.

1489
01:51:45,707 --> 01:51:49,620
- Let's get on with the number, huh?
- Oh, you want to hurry back to the bo's's.

1490
01:51:49,947 --> 01:51:51,699
Maybe he ha's a pre'sent.

1491
01:51:52,027 --> 01:51:54,257
He like's that funny face, huh?

1492
01:51:54,427 --> 01:51:58,420
Tell me, would he 'still like it
if Minyak lean's a little bit?

1493
01:51:58,507 --> 01:52:00,179
Klau's, are you nut's? Let me up.

1494
01:52:00,267 --> 01:52:01,825

01:52:01,907 --> 01:52:04,944
Be careful. You make Minyak nervou's.

lying little heart.

Steady, Minyak.
I's your foot getting tired?

01:52:18,667 --> 01:52:20,703
You want to put it down?

1501
01:52:21,427 --> 01:52:22,826
No, my 'sweet.

1502
01:52:22,987 --> 01:52:25,057
You will never go to any other man.

1503
01:52:25,707 --> 01:52:27,857

01:52:38,067 --> 01:52:39,182
Angel.

1509
01:52:39,387 --> 01:52:40,740

- You fire me becau'se...

1511
01:52:47,827 --> 01:52:51,103
Now get out of here before
I have you up for attempted murder.

1512
01:54:32,947 --> 01:54:34,744
Buy a circu's 'souvenir.

01:54:35,347 --> 01:54:37,019
Take home a balloon for the...

1514
01:54:37,107 --> 01:54:39,496
Would you like a balloon? Good.

1515
01:55:02,667 --> 01:55:04,180
Life ha's made me a clown.

1516
01:55:04,267 --> 01:55:06,576
Itll have to make you
a better bu'sine's'sman.

1517
01:55:06,667 --> 01:55:08,066
Thank you.

1518
01:55:09,187 --> 01:55:11,462
Hey, little one. You are tickling me.

1519
01:55:11,787 --> 01:55:13,186
You can feel that?

1520
01:55:13,267 --> 01:55:15,417
He's trying to be friendly,
to cheer me up.

1521
01:55:15,507 --> 01:55:17,737
Come on, Seba'stian.
Dont block the entrance.

1522
01:55:17,827 --> 01:55:19,499
Get with it, Button's.

1523
01:55:27,627 --> 01:55:29,697
All right, boy's, let them roll.
One buck get's you fifty.

1524
01:55:29,787 --> 01:55:33,336
- My dice. Ill bet $3.00.
- Okay, $3.00. Let the dice roll.

1525
01:55:33,427 --> 01:55:34,985
Six. Your point.

1526
01:55:35,067 --> 01:55:38,298
Harry. What we 'said, III do it.

1527
01:55:38,947 --> 01:55:42,303
So you finally got wi'se, huh?
I got it all figured. It's a cinch.

1528
01:55:42,387 --> 01:55:44,264
- Tonight.
- Sure. Havent you heard?

1529
01:55:44,347 --> 01:55:47,145
Were giving a party
in the red pay wagon.

1530
01:55:47,227 --> 01:55:50,060
Seven. A lo'ser. Sorry, friend's.
No winner's. That's all.

1531
01:55:50,147 --> 01:55:53,139
- Hey, wait a minute.
- I 'said that's all.

1532
01:55:53,227 --> 01:55:54,262
A fine game you got here.

1533
01:55:54,347 --> 01:55:56,144
You dont even get a chance
to get your dough back.

1534
01:56:06,347 --> 01:56:08,941
- Everything all right in there, Curly?
- Okay.

1535
01:56:09,227 --> 01:56:11,422
But next year,
let's carry the ca'sh in the gorilla cage.

1536
01:56:11,507 --> 01:56:13,225
It's air-conditioned.

1537
01:56:15,267 --> 01:56:17,223
Well, dont let it 'sit here and get ru'sty.

1538
01:56:17,307 --> 01:56:18,945
- Take it away.
- Right.

1539
01:56:25,747 --> 01:56:27,419
Mr Braden?

1540
01:56:27,507 --> 01:56:28,622
That's right.

1541
01:56:28,707 --> 01:56:30,937
Trea'sury. Special inve'stigation's.

1542
01:56:31,107 --> 01:56:32,335
What can I do for you?

1543
01:56:32,427 --> 01:56:34,702
You carry a doctor with thi's 'show?

1544
01:56:34,787 --> 01:56:37,381
Ye's.
You u'sually find him in the privilege car.

1545
01:56:37,467 --> 01:56:39,697
Doe's he look anything like thi's?

1546
01:56:44,587 --> 01:56:45,656
No.

1547
01:56:45,747 --> 01:56:46,782
You 'sure?

1548
01:56:46,867 --> 01:56:48,778
Ten year's can make quite a difference.

1549
01:56:48,867 --> 01:56:50,505
What's he wanted for?

1550
01:56:50,587 --> 01:56:52,543
Murder. It's an odd ca'se.

1551
01:56:52,627 --> 01:56:54,663
A young doctor killed hi's wife.

1552
01:56:54,947 --> 01:56:56,539
She wa's dying anyway.

1553
01:56:56,627 --> 01:56:58,345
What will he get?

1554
01:56:58,787 --> 01:57:00,823
Lm a policeman, not a judge.

1555
01:57:01,707 --> 01:57:03,902
- Why pick on u's?
- Ju'st a hunch.

1556
01:57:05,547 --> 01:57:08,107
He wa's alway's cha'sing circu'se's
a's a kid.

1557
01:57:08,387 --> 01:57:10,059
You wont 'see that face around here.

1558
01:57:10,147 --> 01:57:11,421
Probably not.

1559
01:57:11,507 --> 01:57:14,340
Anyway, lve arranged to fingerprint
'some of your people in Cedar City.

1560
01:57:14,427 --> 01:57:15,860
Do you mind if I ride along with you?

1561
01:57:15,947 --> 01:57:18,825
No. The head porter will fix you up
with a berth.

1562
01:57:19,147 --> 01:57:20,546
Thank you.

1563
01:58:00,907 --> 01:58:03,296
About here. Thatll 'stop the red wagon
back at the road.

1564
01:58:15,507 --> 01:58:16,622
Come on. Snap it up.

1565
01:58:16,707 --> 01:58:19,426
Fir'st 'section will be along pretty 'soon.

1566
01:58:21,507 --> 01:58:23,065
Come on. Come on.

1567
01:59:08,387 --> 01:59:10,218
- Say, Button's...
- Here you are, Brad.

1568
01:59:10,307 --> 01:59:11,422
- I got the next one.
- Thank's.

1569
01:59:13,187 --> 01:59:14,540
Youre alway's around
when there's trouble.

1570
01:59:14,627 --> 01:59:16,458
Youre pretty hard to find
when the new's i's good.

1571
01:59:16,547 --> 01:59:19,425
I got tied up
with a cop who's riding with u's.

1572
01:59:19,627 --> 01:59:20,821
He's looking for 'someone.

1573
01:59:20,907 --> 01:59:22,465
Anything 'seriou's?

1574
01:59:22,547 --> 01:59:23,696
Murder.

1575
01:59:24,787 --> 01:59:26,584
He u'sed to be a doctor.

1576
01:59:27,107 --> 01:59:29,701
You find the darnede'st people
around a circu's, dont you?

1577
01:59:29,787 --> 01:59:30,902
Yeah.

1578
01:59:31,747 --> 01:59:34,625
What wa's thi's good new's?
I could u'se 'some.

1579
01:59:35,347 --> 01:59:36,860
Good new's?

1580
01:59:37,987 --> 01:59:39,739
Seba'stian, there.

1581
01:59:40,107 --> 01:59:41,984
He's got feeling in that hand.

1582
01:59:42,987 --> 01:59:47,105
Ye's, and if there's 'still feeling,
complete recovery i's very po's'sible.

1583
01:59:47,987 --> 01:59:50,137
I's that a profe's'sional opinion?

1584
01:59:51,387 --> 01:59:53,378
That's a clown's opinion.

1585
01:59:53,587 --> 01:59:55,418
Why dont you rile him up a little?

1586
01:59:55,507 --> 01:59:56,906
Might get your flyer back.

1587
01:59:56,987 --> 01:59:58,625
Yeah, III do that.

1588
01:59:59,547 --> 02:00:02,459
By the way, theyre going to take
'some fingerprint's when we get in.

1589
02:00:02,547 --> 02:00:03,900
Okay.

1590
02:00:17,347 --> 02:00:19,065
Ill get revenge tomorrow night.

1591
02:00:19,147 --> 02:00:21,024
Alway's lm lucky at card's.

1592
02:00:21,627 --> 02:00:23,345
You 'sure it's luck?

1593
02:00:24,027 --> 02:00:25,824
You think I cheat maybe?

1594
02:00:25,907 --> 02:00:28,216
Why not? Youve done it before.

1595
02:00:29,027 --> 02:00:31,097
- I do not like thi's joke.
- It's no joke.

1596
02:00:31,187 --> 02:00:32,381
- Steady.
- Wait a minute.

1597
02:00:32,467 --> 02:00:34,344
Well, he u'sed hi's bum arm
to get Holly, didnt he?

1598
02:00:34,427 --> 02:00:35,701
You know you lie.

1599
02:00:35,787 --> 02:00:38,460
Youve got it all figured to get your'self
a meal ticket for life, havent you?

1600
02:00:38,547 --> 02:00:39,980
Latching onto her.

1601
02:00:40,947 --> 02:00:41,982
You moved it.

1602
02:00:42,067 --> 02:00:43,898
- He 'sure did.
- You bet he did.

1603
02:00:45,907 --> 02:00:46,976
That's why you 'say the'se thing's.

1604
02:00:47,067 --> 02:00:48,580
How about it, Doc?
Will he be able to u'se it?

1605
02:00:48,667 --> 02:00:50,976
- It certainly did move.
- Of cour'se he did, Doc.

1606
02:00:51,067 --> 02:00:52,944
You know, that 'should get well.

1607
02:00:53,787 --> 02:00:55,903
I believe that with p'sycho'somatic
treatment, that thi's might be...

1608
02:00:55,987 --> 02:00:57,386
You did thi's for me?

1609
02:00:57,467 --> 02:00:59,697
For you?
I wouldnt give you 'storage 'space.

1610
02:00:59,787 --> 02:01:02,301
But youre a good flyer.
The 'show need's you.

1611
02:01:02,387 --> 02:01:04,105
Now, keep working on it.

1612
02:01:04,187 --> 02:01:06,337
You crazy, wonderful fool.

1613
02:01:07,667 --> 02:01:10,818
You know that with my wing's clipped,
I would never marry Holly.

1614
02:01:10,907 --> 02:01:12,465
Yet you rai'se me into the air again.

1615
02:01:13,827 --> 02:01:15,624
Becau'se you are circu's.

1616
02:01:17,107 --> 02:01:18,984
I mu'st tell Holly.

1617
02:01:19,867 --> 02:01:22,506
Maybe we name
our fir'st baby Bo's'sman.

1618
02:01:25,027 --> 02:01:26,585
Good work, Brad.

1619
02:01:27,067 --> 02:01:28,136

Wait till the engine's pa's'sed.

1622
02:02:24,307 --> 02:02:27,060
Unlock the door and dont try anything.

1623
02:02:47,587 --> 02:02:49,066
Pa's's it down.

1624
02:02:51,947 --> 02:02:53,016
Can you 'see the trouble?

1625
02:02:53,107 --> 02:02:54,984
Cant 'see nothing ahead.

1626
02:02:59,947 --> 02:03:02,177
Get going. We gotta burn rubber.

1627
02:03:09,907 --> 02:03:12,102
- What's that?
- Second 'section.

1628
02:03:14,027 --> 02:03:15,096
Look.

02:03:15,187 --> 02:03:16,700
Get out of here. Thi's i's the girl's car.

1630
02:03:16,787 --> 02:03:18,220
Men are not allowed in here.

1631
02:03:18,307 --> 02:03:19,376
Whod you come to 'see?

1632
02:03:19,467 --> 02:03:21,697
What did you do, boy 'scout,
lo'se your compa's's?

1633
02:03:21,787 --> 02:03:23,106
Well, what are you doing
in no man's land?

1634
02:03:23,187 --> 02:03:24,905
Angel, you are going
to be a bride'smaid.

1635
02:03:24,987 --> 02:03:27,023
- Who's getting married?
- You are, my darling.

1636
02:03:27,107 --> 02:03:29,098
Angel. She's on that train.

1637
02:03:29,347 --> 02:03:31,303
So what? We got the dough.
Let's get out of here.

1638
02:03:31,387 --> 02:03:34,106

I mu'st turn the light's back on the track.

1639
02:03:34,187 --> 02:03:35,700
You crazy lunkhead.
Give me that wheel.

1640
02:03:35,787 --> 02:03:38,460
Were going to turn the light's

Every time hi's heart beat's,

Well, maybe you killed 'someone
becau'se you loved her 'so much.

Oh, Button's. Ive alway's loved him.

If that detective 'see's you doing thi's,

02:12:42,667 --> 02:12:44,897
- What doe's that mean?
- Well, it's hard to find.

1829
02:12:44,987 --> 02:12:46,739
There mu'st be a blood bank
in Cedar City.

1830
02:12:46,827 --> 02:12:47,942
We dont have any time for that.

1831
02:12:48,027 --> 02:12:49,426
Now, look, 'some of you go out and 'see

1832

- Seba'stian.
- Not him.

1836
02:12:59,987 --> 02:13:01,784
Youre not gonna put
that guy's blood in me.

1837
02:13:01,867 --> 02:13:03,823
You dont have enough blood in you now
to quibble about it.

1838
02:13:03,907 --> 02:13:06,501
Sit down here. Roll up your left 'sleeve.

1839
02:13:06,587 --> 02:13:08,657
- All right.

1840
02:13:08,747 --> 02:13:10,817
Button's, find 'somebody el'se.

1841
02:13:10,907 --> 02:13:13,341
Youll be dead in 20 minute's
without him.

1842
02:13:13,427 --> 02:13:14,780
Here, 'soak thi's in alcohol.

1843
02:13:14,867 --> 02:13:18,496
All right, but ju'st take enough
till you can get 'some other guy.

1844
02:13:18,587 --> 02:13:22,421
It hurt's me a's much a's it doe's you,
but noble's'se oblige.

1845
02:13:22,507 --> 02:13:23,860
You ought to be grateful.

1846
02:13:23,947 --> 02:13:26,063
Grateful? To him?

1847
02:13:26,147 --> 02:13:28,786
Lve had nothing but trouble
ever 'since you joined the 'show.

1848
02:13:28,867 --> 02:13:32,621
They warned me about you,
but I had to find out the hard way.

1849
02:13:32,707 --> 02:13:34,504
Big 'stuff in the air.

1850
02:13:34,587 --> 02:13:37,897
Up'setting the whole circu's,
chopping down your net.

1851
02:13:37,987 --> 02:13:41,024
Now you want to be a hero, 'save my life.

1852
02:13:41,107 --> 02:13:42,825
I dont want any part of you.

1853
02:13:42,907 --> 02:13:45,057
I do not want to give you my good blood,

1854
02:13:45,147 --> 02:13:47,786
but what it will do for you...

1855
02:13:48,267 --> 02:13:49,825
Ha'snt done much for you.

1856
02:13:49,907 --> 02:13:54,423
If he 'should make love well after thi's,
pay no attention. It will be me.

1857
02:13:54,987 --> 02:13:58,297
- I cant 'see. Give me the light over here.
- Ill take it.

1858
02:14:00,107 --> 02:14:01,620
Go ahead, Doctor.

1859
02:14:08,067 --> 02:14:10,137
Ye's. Take all you want.

02:14:10,227 --> 02:14:12,661
It will make of him a better man.

1861
02:14:12,747 --> 02:14:16,217
He will have more fire,
more of what women love.

1862
02:14:16,307 --> 02:14:18,821
They may even want to marry you.

1863
02:14:19,707 --> 02:14:23,177
And each time you look at
one of your children, bo's's man,

1864
02:14:23,267 --> 02:14:24,905
you will 'see me.

1865
02:14:24,987 --> 02:14:26,420

02:14:26,507 --> 02:14:27,656

02:14:27,747 --> 02:14:30,022
It's the end of the line. Were licked.

1868
02:14:30,107 --> 02:14:32,575
We aint got no big top,

The bareback riders

1951
02:18:35,227 --> 02:18:37,866
And the fearless tightrope walkers

1952
02:18:37,947 --> 02:18:41,223
The cuddly bears do their routine

1953
02:18:41,307 --> 02:18:43,377
The greatest extravaganza

Shouting,
Peanuts, popcorn and lemonade

The human cannonball will zoom

As trumpets blare
and bass drums boom

1961
02:19:10,947 --> 02:19:14,223
To entertain your mom and pop

1962
02:19:14,707 --> 02:19:17,699
