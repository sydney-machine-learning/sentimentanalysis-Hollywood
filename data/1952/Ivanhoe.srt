1
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:24,324
<i>In the 12th century, at the close of
the Third Crusade to free the Holy Land...</i>

2
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:27,277
<i>... a Saxon knight,
called Wilfred of Ivanhoe...</i>

3
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,123
<i>... undertook a private crusade of his own.</i>

4
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:33,038
<i>England's warrior king,
Richard the Lion-Hearted...</i>

5
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,258
<i>... had disappeared during his
homeward march, vanishing without trace.</i>

6
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:40,871
<i>His disappearance dealt a cruel blow
to his unhappy country...</i>

7
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,164
<i>... already in turmoil from the bitter conflict
between Saxon and Norman.</i>

8
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:49,638
<i>And in time, most of his subjects
came to mourn him as dead.</i>

9
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:52,655
<i>But Ivanhoe's faith
that his king still lived...</i>

10
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:55,664
<i>... took him on an endless quest
from castle to castle...</i>

11
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,929
<i>... until, at last, he came to Austria.</i>

12
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,815
Who are you?
What do you want of me?

13
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,143
Tell me what is written here.
I read no Austrian.

14
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,521
Happily, I read English.

15
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:55,343
Read it to me happily, then.

16
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:59,441
"To the people of England...

17
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:03,434
...I am here held captive
by Leopold of Austria.

18
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:06,451
My brother, Prince John,
has knowledge of it...

19
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:12,809
...yet he has denied me ransom,
150,000 marks of silver.

20
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,290
I fear he does conspire
with certain Norman knights...

21
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,183
...to seize my throne.

22
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:23,790
People of England, speed my deliverance.

23
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:26,161
Your kingdom is at stake".

24
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:29,906
- It is signed...
- I know the hand that signed it.

25
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,418
But the eyes that saw it shall forget
that name and all they read.

26
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:37,004
Or this knife will pluck them out
and cast them to the crows.

27
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,668
Do you remember what you saw?

28
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:42,414
I have forgotten every syllable.

29
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,185
"Prince John...

30
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:51,218
...and certain Norman knights".

31
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:34,640
"Certain Norman knights".

32
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:40,973
These glades go on forever.

33
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:44,209
I hope we find shelter before nightfall,
Bois-Guilbert.

34
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:46,644
What do you fear, De Bracy,
Saxon hobgoblins?

35
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:49,458
No, a Saxon arrow
in the small of my back.

36
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:52,208
I wager there's a cutthroat
behind every tree trunk.

37
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,612
Aye. And soon,
they'll be hanging from them.

38
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,433
Unless we are.

39
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,041
God save you, knight.

40
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:08,655
And God save you. We ride
to Ashby. Which crossroad do we take?

41
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:10,514
The right will take you to Ashby.

42
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:13,526
- Shall we get there by nightfall?
- By nightfall tomorrow.

43
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:16,917
Tomorrow? Can you show us the way
to a roof for the night?

44
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,146
I know of a roof nearby,
but perhaps you would scorn it.

45
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,933
Why? Is it humble?

46
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:23,921
No, sire. It is Saxon.

47
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:25,844
I'd sooner bivouac by the road.

48
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:28,561
- 'Tis a fine night.
- To be butchered in one's sleep.

49
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:32,502
- Would you sooner walk into a Saxon trap?
- What is this house you speak of?

50
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:35,639
Rotherwood, the keep of Cedric the Saxon.

51
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,932
I believe I know this Cedric the Saxon.

52
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:41,071
Has he a ward, a woman of great beauty?

53
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,018
The Saxon princess, Lady Rowena,
is his ward.

54
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,382
Aye, Rowena. 'Tis the same Cedric.

55
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:49,454
He loves us not, but we would
sleep safe beneath his roof.

56
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,599
- You know the way?
- Well enough to lead.

57
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:55,183
Then lead us, but one false step
and you'll sing a different song.

58
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:57,174
I have a song to fit every occasion.

59
00:06:57,336 --> 00:07:01,330
- He means he'll lop your head off, minstrel.
- Yes, sire, I knew what he meant.

60
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:21,235
- Now, Locksley, while they're in range.
- Peace, hothead. Would you slay Ivanhoe?

61
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:24,336
- Ivanhoe died in the Holy Land.
- The troubadour is Ivanhoe.

62
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:26,480
He takes those Normans to his father's.

63
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:30,228
Ivanhoe defied his father when he went
to the war. Cedric cast him off.

64
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:33,907
He would never go back,
unless he's turned traitor to the Saxons.

65
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:35,251
Put down your bows.

66
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:39,279
I'll know why he takes those Normans
to his father before I'll believe ill...

67
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,280
...of Sir Ivanhoe or Cedric.
And so shall you, you rattle-pate.

68
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:21,267
By your leave, milord, two knights
do request food and lodging.

69
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,435
They are Normans,
lately returned from the Holy Land.

70
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:28,690
If they break no laws of courtesy as guests,
I'll break none as host.

71
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:31,925
Bid them enter and depart in peace,
or else depart in pieces.

72
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:35,768
Elgitha, tell the lady Rowena I do not
desire her presence here tonight.

73
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,233
But she is pining for news
from the Holy Land.

74
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:41,592
When she hears they are Normans,
she'll want none of their news.

75
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,071
Tell her to keep to her chambers
till we're quit of them tomorrow.

76
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:58,006
Sir Brian De Bois-Guilbert
and Sir Hugh De Bracy, milord.

77
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,405
We come in peace, Sir Cedric.

78
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:01,816
In peace, I greet you.

79
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,598
We come, also, as friends.

80
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:10,070
I greet no one in friendship, save those
who share the royal Saxon blood.

81
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:12,789
Homely fare is before you.
Eat your fill of it.

82
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:35,993
Take me to the Lady Rowena.

83
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,294
Who is there?

84
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,014
A sort of fool, milady.

85
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:52,148
Come in, Wamba.
Make me laugh a little.

86
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:55,228
Tonight, milady, I do not play the fool.

87
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:56,851
I play the wizard.

88
00:09:57,021 --> 00:10:00,153
Close your eyes, and I will perform...

89
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:02,260
...a wonder.

90
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,015
How long must I keep my eyes closed?

91
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:06,359
Till you have wished.

92
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:08,533
What shall I wish for?

93
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:11,004
Whom do you hold most dear?

94
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,021
You know who that is.

95
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:15,865
Say his name, and he shall come to you.

96
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,963
Ivanhoe.

97
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:21,589
- Oh, I knew, I knew.
- Knew what, Rowena?

98
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:26,100
I knew that you were safe and that
you were alive and that you loved me still.

99
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:33,854
I used to reach out my hands at night
when I couldn't sleep...

100
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:36,764
...and there was only darkness
all around me.

101
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:39,130
And I'd feel your fingertips touch mine...

102
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:42,426
...and I knew you were still alive,
and I was comforted.

103
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:46,453
There was never a day nor an hour
when your hand was not in mine.

104
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:51,000
Why are you crying?

105
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:53,049
I'm... I'm too happy to laugh.

106
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:57,339
- I've never known such happiness.
- Nor have I, ever.

107
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:01,333
It's as if you'd never been away,
as if I'd never suffered any loneliness...

108
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,016
...except in a dream that I awoke from
when you kissed me.

109
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:11,125
This was not a dream, though.

110
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,331
The scars are almost gone.

111
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:17,274
Do you remember how afraid you were?

112
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:20,254
Not when you cut my wrist,
only when you cut your own.

113
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:22,204
And I know I didn't show it.

114
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:26,623
You were trembling as you knelt beside me
when we made our vow to God.

115
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,887
While my blood mingled with yours.

116
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,598
Does my father hate me still?

117
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,662
No one is allowed to speak your name.

118
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:43,933
Then I must make my peace with him
as swiftly as I can.

119
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:46,333
- Ivanhoe, what trouble are you in?
- None yet.

120
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:49,431
But Richard is not dead.
He's held for ransom in Austria...

121
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:53,048
...and John would keep him there.
I've snared two Norman hawks below.

122
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:55,485
I cannot hood them single-handed.
I need aid.

123
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,950
- What help can I be?
- Come and draw them out.

124
00:11:58,112 --> 00:12:00,796
These are John's friends.
If my father will help me...

125
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:03,710
...I can trick them into telling
what they know.

126
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:06,328
And if he will not help you?

127
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:09,692
Then, indeed, I have no father.

128
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:26,336
Where's Wamba? Where's my fool?
I want to be amused.

129
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:29,247
And you'll find it hard enough to do.

130
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:33,078
- I've been unavoidably delayed, milord.
- Delayed? How so?

131
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,486
When I heard Normans
were approaching...

132
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:37,405
...I ran to lock up my wife.

133
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,958
But she'd also heard
they were approaching...

134
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,334
...and locked me up instead.

135
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:49,307
A fool's wife is safe, milord.

136
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:53,499
We are bound for combat against your
Saxon knights at Ashby, three days hence.

137
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,732
- Not for any Saxon lady's chamber.
- And how will you spend...

138
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:58,589
...your last three days on earth?

139
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,185
It will not be my friend and I who will die.
Will you be there to see the Saxons fall?

140
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:09,244
Milord, there is a stranger at your gate
who begs shelter.

141
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,160
He is a Jew who calls himself Isaac of York.

142
00:13:13,346 --> 00:13:15,288
I share no roof with an infidel.

143
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:19,545
Why not, sir knight? For every Jew
you show me who's not a Christian...

144
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,658
...I'll show you a Christian
who's not a Christian.

145
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:25,470
Why should my guests be subject
to your prejudices...

146
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:29,596
...when they have not been subject to
my own? Bid this traveler enter in peace.

147
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:41,978
I come in peace, milord.

148
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:44,122
May God reward your mercy.

149
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:46,467
In peace, I greet you.

150
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:50,043
Make a place for him at the table,
and give him food and drink.

151
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:09,950
If hearsay does not lie, you have a ward
of surpassing beauty, milord.

152
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:14,045
Why is the hall dimmed by the absence
of the brightest flame in Saxon England?

153
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:18,915
Because, sir knight, we Saxons have learned
to hide our light under a bushel.

154
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:21,247
Are we condemned never to pay homage
to her?

155
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:26,011
No Saxon princess seeks homage from
the men who took her lands by conquest...

156
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:29,726
...threw down her ancient laws
and put her subjects to the sword.

157
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,977
Those well-chewed scraps of bile
were better thrown to the dogs...

158
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:35,326
...than to Normans.

159
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:37,828
While such as you were sulking
here at home...

160
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:40,477
...we held the infidel at bay
in England's name...

161
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:42,434
...and fell before his fury.

162
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:45,085
If our blood is red enough
to bleed for England...

163
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:47,904
...it's red enough to pay homage
to any woman:

164
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,596
Saxon, Norman, Dane or Celt.

165
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,773
Then pay me your homage, sir...

166
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:54,210
...and let me be the judge of its gallantry.

167
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:15,296
We pay you homage, milady.

168
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:18,310
But it must be silent homage,
for words would fail it...

169
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,918
...just as they have failed my friend,
and all but failed me.

170
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:23,711
I thank you, sir knight.

171
00:15:23,878 --> 00:15:26,180
There are questions
that I would ask of you...

172
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,415
...as soon as your tongue is loose again.

173
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,299
At your command, milady.

174
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:34,181
What is the news from the Holy Land?

175
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:37,638
Alas, milady, I can add little
to what you must already know.

176
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:40,384
The war has ended
in a truceless truce once more...

177
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:44,609
...and Richard vanished upon the wind
that once made up the better part of him.

178
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,553
Richard should've stayed at home
and kept England...

179
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:50,817
...and left Jerusalem to be lost
by knights like you...

180
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,089
...who lost it anyway.

181
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:57,247
Are you for Richard, milord, or for John?

182
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,804
<i>Richard and John had the same mother</i>

183
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:02,626
<i>One was a Norman
So, what was the other?</i>

184
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,417
Both were Norman, true.

185
00:16:04,743 --> 00:16:07,525
But Richard, with all his faults,
was for England.

186
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:09,378
And John?

187
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:12,126
John is for John.

188
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,525
Then you're against John?

189
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:19,068
That's another Norman question.
Shall I answer it for you, milord?

190
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:22,174
No, I would have my questions
answered first. Sir knight...

191
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:25,922
...I believe there were tournaments
between Saxon and Norman knights...

192
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:29,569
...to prove which was more valiant.
- Aye, milady, in the Holy Land.

193
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:32,639
The Saxons were at last taught
to bow to their betters.

194
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:35,296
And yet, I hear the Saxons
won the tournaments.

195
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,302
How does a Saxon lady come to know
so much of such distant matters?

196
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:42,430
Only from the tales I hear, sir knight.

197
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,251
And I was told that
in the tournament at Acre...

198
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,831
...Richard of England led five
of his Saxon knights into combat...

199
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,302
...and vanquished all
who challenged them.

200
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:53,887
The one who fell was named De Bracy.

201
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,999
And another, Bois-Guilbert.

202
00:16:57,513 --> 00:17:00,448
True, milady. I blush, but I admit it.

203
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:05,254
I can still feel the dust in my mouth.
Is it out of your teeth yet, Guilbert?

204
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:09,956
A broken saddle girth caused my fall,
not the bumpkin of a knight I tilted.

205
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:12,576
And who was this bumpkin of a knight?

206
00:17:13,673 --> 00:17:15,877
He named himself Wilfred of Ivanhoe.

207
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:18,918
- Ivanhoe?
- Aye, milady.

208
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:22,398
A friend of Richard's
who vanished as suddenly as his king.

209
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,642
What manner of knight
was he to look upon?

210
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:26,719
I never saw his face.

211
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:28,831
Few men did.

212
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:31,424
But he wore a dragon charge
upon his shield.

213
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,277
I shall know him by that,
if we ever meet again.

214
00:17:34,602 --> 00:17:37,352
- And why did he vanish, sire?
- Because he was a coward.

215
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,691
Coward?

216
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:42,154
Aye, a coward who fled when there
was no Richard to hide behind...

217
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:44,616
...before I could challenge him
to meet me.

218
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:51,234
Then I give you the challenge that Ivanhoe
would give to you were he here, sir knight.

219
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:54,718
And I bid you drink to his honor
as a fellow knight.

220
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,874
And you, milord.

221
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:02,693
Will you drink to his honor too?

222
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:27,528
To Ivanhoe.

223
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,876
- To Ivanhoe.
- To Ivanhoe.

224
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:37,540
Why this Saxon passion
for a stranger, milady?

225
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:42,178
Lvanhoe was not always a stranger
to these halls.

226
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:44,257
He's a stranger now.

227
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:45,769
He was my son.

228
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,368
Was?

229
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:50,401
Have I been cheated?
You mean he's dead?

230
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,578
He is to me.

231
00:19:12,204 --> 00:19:14,277
I have come at my foster child's request.

232
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,314
Nothing else would've brought me.
What do you want of me?

233
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:20,202
- Your hand first, sire.
- I do not give it.

234
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:21,827
Milord, he is still your son.

235
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:24,844
What do you want of me?
Be brief, for I want none of you.

236
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,221
I will be brief, then.
I have found the king.

237
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:33,005
- The king is dead.
- He is alive...

238
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:35,170
...held by Leopold of Austria.

239
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,708
It's all here in his hand.
Read it yourself.

240
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:40,619
John has left him in chains
so he can steal his throne.

241
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:45,189
As those two Norman knights in your castle
could testify, if you put them to the sword.

242
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:46,918
Is it Richard's hand?

243
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,125
Perhaps. Written before they killed him.

244
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:51,715
I heard his voice, I tell you.
The king is alive.

245
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,860
What is the ransom?

246
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,457
150,000 marks of silver.

247
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,706
- There's not that sum in England.
- You could pay your share of it.

248
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:03,464
For what, to buy back Richard's corpse?

249
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:07,656
I'll use what money I have left to slay
the living Normans, not dig up the dead.

250
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:12,044
- You'll leave your king to rot, then?
- I'll leave him to mad, wild fools like you...

251
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:14,029
...who can do neither harm nor good.

252
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,288
Then you force me to choose
between my father and my king.

253
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:20,549
Choose? Choose between whom?

254
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:22,758
You have no king, and I have no son.

255
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:26,504
I bid you take no part in this
nor look upon his face again.

256
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,907
Begone from here within the hour.

257
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,534
What will you do now?

258
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:38,695
Follow Bois-Guilbert to Ashby
and meet him in the lists.

259
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,586
Be cautious, Ivanhoe.

260
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:42,409
Don't be afraid, Rowena.

261
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,853
Richard will be king again, and we shall be
there to see the crown set upon his head.

262
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:49,707
Look for me at the tournament
and pray for me.

263
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:57,256
- Farewell.
- Farewell, and God protect you.

264
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:09,608
Sir Ivanhoe, I heard an old bear
and a young bear growling.

265
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:11,499
Which one would leave the den?

266
00:21:11,664 --> 00:21:12,940
The young bear, Wamba.

267
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:14,794
- Alone?
- Alone.

268
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,294
No, sire. I will go with you.

269
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:19,244
My servant's collar and all.

270
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:21,580
Is your heart not here
with the Lady Rowena?

271
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:26,054
No, sire. My heart is in there, with yours.

272
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:29,007
Then henceforth,
you shall be my squire, Wamba.

273
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:32,965
Squire? Squire Wamba?

274
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:37,708
Wamba the squire. Oh, if it weren't for this,
I'd be a gentleman.

275
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:40,906
We'll have that collar off as soon as
we're away from here.

276
00:22:18,322 --> 00:22:19,566
What...?

277
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,465
Help! Help!

278
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:38,447
Bind them together, Wamba.

279
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,828
How badly are you hurt?

280
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,619
Only a little.

281
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:47,656
My home, Sheffield town...

282
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:51,755
...I want to go back there at once.
- Alone at night? You'd perish.

283
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:53,810
Even so, I must go back to Sheffield.

284
00:22:56,563 --> 00:22:57,970
Then I shall take you there.

285
00:22:58,706 --> 00:23:00,746
I've trussed them up,
like capons.

286
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:03,217
Bring our horses and meet me
in the courtyard.

287
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:06,575
- But, Sir Ivanhoe, I have no horse.
- Then steal one.

288
00:23:06,738 --> 00:23:11,211
A gentleman at last and my first task
is to steal a horse.

289
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:47,379
Take quarters at the sign of the longbow.
I'll join you.

290
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:50,320
- Master. Master.
- Enough, enough.

291
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:53,419
All's well with me. Let us in.

292
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:18,766
- Are you recovered?
- Yes, yes.

293
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:22,032
And much beholden to you
for your kindness, sire.

294
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:24,845
Yet there is one question I would ask.

295
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:28,690
- What is it?
- I heard the jester call you "Ivanhoe".

296
00:24:28,853 --> 00:24:32,202
But Ivanhoe is Cedric's son,
and Cedric called him dead.

297
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:33,715
Who are you, then?

298
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:35,633
I am King Richard's envoy.

299
00:24:35,797 --> 00:24:38,132
Does that make us friends or foes?

300
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:40,464
It does not make you my foe, sire...

301
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,451
...but then, I am allowed no king.

302
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:46,574
- Why not?
- Because I am allowed no country.

303
00:24:47,605 --> 00:24:49,678
I am deeply in your debt, sire.

304
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:52,334
Tell me how I can repay you.

305
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:55,087
I seek 150,000 marks of silver...

306
00:24:55,254 --> 00:24:58,549
...the price of Richard's ransom
from Leopold of Austria.

307
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:02,386
Glance around you, sire.
What you see is all we've saved...

308
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,459
...from every home we tried to make.

309
00:25:04,822 --> 00:25:07,691
A toy or two from every land
that cast us out.

310
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:09,804
I am not a rich man, Sir Ivanhoe.

311
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:13,323
No, but you are the patriarch
of your tribe.

312
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:16,942
Tell your people Richard must be ransomed.
They will find the wealth.

313
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,533
I see you love Richard, sire...

314
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:21,775
...but he was no friend to my people.

315
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:25,238
Our synagogues were looted
to send him on his crusades.

316
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:28,272
Do you prefer the persecution
of his brother, John?

317
00:25:29,143 --> 00:25:34,707
There is little to choose between Black John
and Richard, yea and nay, if you are a Jew.

318
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,184
Then I pledge you this, Isaac.
You're a race without a home or a country.

319
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:43,213
Deliver Richard, and he will deliver
your people from persecution.

320
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:46,903
My friend, you ask for more
than we can give.

321
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:50,358
- And you offer more than Richard can give.
- Do you doubt my word?

322
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:54,414
Write down whatever terms you want.
I shall sign them in King Richard's name.

323
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:59,539
We shall need no pledge on paper,
you and I.

324
00:25:59,703 --> 00:26:03,086
Let Richard promise this instead.

325
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:06,070
Let him promise justice to each man...

326
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,745
...whether he be Saxon
or Norman or Jew...

327
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:12,278
...for justice belongs to all men...

328
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,228
...or it belongs to none.

329
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:16,530
But that is a Christian teaching.

330
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:20,337
Strange as it may be, sire,
we are taught it too.

331
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,311
What you ask shall be done.

332
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,924
So be it, then. Whatever money
you cannot find among your own people...

333
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,193
...I shall try to find it for you.

334
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:32,532
Does that fulfill our pact?

335
00:26:32,696 --> 00:26:34,256
Not quite.

336
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:36,912
This combat at arms at Ashby
is a weather vane...

337
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:39,317
...to test the strength of John.

338
00:26:41,592 --> 00:26:45,455
If his knights were to sweep the field,
how would it go with Richard's cause?

339
00:26:46,457 --> 00:26:50,286
Badly, sire. Money takes fright
when might conquers right.

340
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:55,955
My worldly goods are what I stand in.
I have no armor and no warhorse.

341
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:59,569
But I must ride against John's knights
at Ashby, or they will win.

342
00:26:59,737 --> 00:27:03,185
A horse and gear would borrow
from the ransom.

343
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:05,455
Then I'll seek them elsewhere.

344
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:08,211
You'll find me at the sign
of the longbow.

345
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,541
Here is my hand,
in token of my pledge to you.

346
00:27:14,554 --> 00:27:16,626
Why do you look at me thus, Isaac?

347
00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:22,610
This is the first time I touch a Saxon hand
in friendship, Sir Ivanhoe.

348
00:27:22,778 --> 00:27:25,331
It is Richard's hand you touch.

349
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:52,017
Now for thy collar, good squire.
Kneel down.

350
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:54,969
<i>A cow jumped the moon
But a fool, he jumps higher</i>

351
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:59,321
<i>From Wamba the serf
To Wamba the squire</i>

352
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:05,240
Oh, strike, Sir Ivanhoe,
while I still have me courage.

353
00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:07,351
Then off come your shackles.

354
00:28:07,515 --> 00:28:10,996
Oh, no. Make sure it's the shackles,
not my head.

355
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,032
There.

356
00:28:18,523 --> 00:28:21,622
May your next collar be no heavier
than a pretty woman's arms.

357
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:24,821
Oh, that, sire, is a collar
that I shall change every day.

358
00:28:26,043 --> 00:28:29,392
When they first put this on me, sire,
I was 11 years old.

359
00:28:29,563 --> 00:28:32,946
My father died with his
still around his neck.

360
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:36,214
I feel very strange.

361
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:39,129
Strange? To be free?

362
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:43,667
Yes, and I could wish that the whole
of England could feel as strange as I do.

363
00:28:43,836 --> 00:28:46,651
And so they shall,
as soon as Richard's king again.

364
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:48,852
Now, good squire, get you to sleep.

365
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,514
Squire.

366
00:28:55,996 --> 00:28:58,069
Stand and declare yourself.

367
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,215
Now, milady, what is your purpose here?

368
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,617
I was told to deliver this to your lodgings.

369
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:14,130
At this hour? By the window?
Who sent you?

370
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:17,270
This is no time to lose your tongue.
Who sent you?

371
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:21,461
I come from the household
of Isaac of York.

372
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:25,431
Open the box.

373
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:35,187
- What are these for?
- For you.

374
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:40,243
If these are Isaac's, he would have given
them to me before I left.

375
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:44,342
They are not his to give. They were handed
down to my mistress by her mother.

376
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:47,031
Who is your mistress?

377
00:29:47,773 --> 00:29:49,529
Rebecca, the daughter of Isaac.

378
00:29:49,693 --> 00:29:53,271
She bade me tell you that these
are for your armor and your horse...

379
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:55,193
...so that you may ride at Ashby.

380
00:30:09,438 --> 00:30:11,991
Is this with
your mother's knowledge, Rebecca?

381
00:30:15,903 --> 00:30:19,132
My mother was killed in Spain
two years ago.

382
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:21,466
That is why my father
brought me to England.

383
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:29,079
If I should fall at Ashby, horse and armor are
forfeit to the victor. These would all be lost.

384
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:30,457
You will not fall.

385
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:32,411
But if I should?

386
00:30:32,575 --> 00:30:34,233
Then England would fall too.

387
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,589
Do you love England so much?

388
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:42,430
Does a prisoner love his prison?

389
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:46,809
- Then why do you give me your jewels?
- In return for my father's life.

390
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:50,205
- Your father has rewarded me already.
- Then I reward you again.

391
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:54,077
If you change your mind, in fear, to ride
at Ashby, give these back to me.

392
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:56,214
Otherwise, use them to win the day.

393
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:58,489
I shall use them.

394
00:30:59,808 --> 00:31:02,012
That is all I came to hear.

395
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:03,605
May I have your leave to go?

396
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:05,150
Not alone.

397
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:10,270
Squire? Wamba!

398
00:31:10,432 --> 00:31:14,524
Squire Wamba? That's me. Coming, sire.

399
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,022
- My squire will attend you.
- Thank you.

400
00:31:17,184 --> 00:31:19,421
Give this lady escort
to the house of Isaac.

401
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:21,078
Right willingly, sire.

402
00:31:21,568 --> 00:31:24,884
I wish you well, sir knight. Farewell.

403
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:26,463
Farewell?

404
00:31:26,624 --> 00:31:30,683
Will you not be there at Ashby,
when it is you who have put me in the lists?

405
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:34,456
Do not look for me at Ashby, sire.

406
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,283
Why not?

407
00:31:36,449 --> 00:31:38,554
Because it is not wise for me to go...

408
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:41,623
...and still less wise if you were seen
to greet me there.

409
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:43,386
But why?

410
00:31:45,185 --> 00:31:48,087
Because I am my father's daughter,
sir knight.

411
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,882
Why else?

412
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:11,773
Nobly ridden, my lords.

413
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:13,695
I never yet saw better sport.

414
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:18,137
- The day is already ours, Your Highness.
- Aye, the Saxons are poor losers, Fitzurse.

415
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:20,130
Look at their faces now.

416
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:24,956
Richard destroyed the flower of the land.

417
00:33:25,124 --> 00:33:28,288
And now his brother destroys
the seedlings that are left.

418
00:33:28,452 --> 00:33:30,819
If only I were a man for one short hour.

419
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,322
We'd still need a hundred like you
to bring back Saxon glory to this field.

420
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:46,530
I was wrong to let you coax me here,
Rebecca. Only grief can come of it.

421
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,872
What's this, another challenger?

422
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:58,175
I thought we'd picked them clean.

423
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,667
Your name, sir knight, or your degree?

424
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:25,506
My name, I withhold. My allegiance
is to Richard, King of England.

425
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:29,629
Are you Norman or Saxon?

426
00:34:30,214 --> 00:34:31,424
I am Saxon.

427
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:34,948
Choose your adversary...

428
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,979
...by stroke of lance upon his shield.

429
00:34:46,054 --> 00:34:48,923
Black from hoof to plume,
the ill-omened knave.

430
00:34:49,094 --> 00:34:51,582
He'll soon be bright with blood,
Your Highness.

431
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,125
The madman. He defies all five!

432
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:39,998
Bash him quickly, Malvoisin.

433
00:36:04,615 --> 00:36:09,318
By all that's wonderful, I almost see myself
grown young again, Rowena.

434
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:15,013
He reminds me much
of a certain pupil of mine.

435
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:21,094
I'll bring Malvoisin to his knees for this,
the empty-headed jay.

436
00:36:42,345 --> 00:36:45,957
By holy St. Dunstan,
our champion pays homage to the Jews.

437
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,299
No, milord...

438
00:36:47,465 --> 00:36:50,629
...his homage was to beauty,
not to faith, I fear.

439
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:54,531
I think I know that knight, Rebecca.

440
00:36:54,697 --> 00:36:56,355
But how do you?

441
00:36:57,577 --> 00:37:00,098
But did you not bring him to our house?

442
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,649
How did he get his armor and his horse?

443
00:37:06,921 --> 00:37:09,310
My mother's jewels were mine to give.

444
00:37:09,866 --> 00:37:11,622
Did I do wrong?

445
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,275
Nay.

446
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,067
I approve.

447
00:37:16,522 --> 00:37:18,856
But only of the gift.

448
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,399
Aye.

449
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,785
Hide that face from every man, save me.

450
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,918
His taste in women is a glove
in every Saxon face.

451
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:42,247
Now let Sir Ralph throw him,
and his shame's complete.

452
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:10,723
Front De Boeuf, the field is all yours.

453
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:12,298
I shall follow you to glory.

454
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:13,888
Follow with a basket, then.

455
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,889
I'm going to strew the field
with Saxon guts and bones.

456
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:23,881
If you could tear your eyes
from your light of love, Guilbert...

457
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:27,819
...this black knight's tricks bear watching.
- I have been watching.

458
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:32,070
He swings his shield low, levels at the head,
but drops point before shock.

459
00:38:32,236 --> 00:38:35,552
I swear I've met these methods
once before, but where?

460
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:04,170
Oh, rich. Oh, richly done.

461
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:08,611
Let him do it twice more, and I'll not say
a word if his love was a Barbary ape.

462
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:10,374
I would she were.

463
00:39:11,085 --> 00:39:12,579
This knight is no stranger.

464
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:15,596
- Only one Saxon could ever fight like that.
- Sir Ivanhoe?

465
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:20,361
- And you would've had me shoot him down.
- Why, it was I who stopped you.

466
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:26,979
May he choke on his beard!

467
00:39:27,149 --> 00:39:30,378
He went at his foe like a stupid bull
to the slaughter.

468
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:33,252
Now it's De Bracy.

469
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:51,496
He's hurt.

470
00:39:51,662 --> 00:39:54,084
Oh, I pray to God he rides no more.

471
00:39:54,254 --> 00:39:57,735
To whose god shall a Jew pray
for a gentile?

472
00:39:57,902 --> 00:40:00,323
To the same God who made them both.

473
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,726
Fitzurse, have this upstart
brought before me.

474
00:40:10,894 --> 00:40:12,967
I intend to mark him well.

475
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:14,695
Marshal!

476
00:40:15,438 --> 00:40:16,780
Ride again.

477
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:20,292
It takes more than a lisping Norman
to unhorse my son.

478
00:40:20,463 --> 00:40:22,023
You have no son.

479
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:23,882
I've heard you say it.

480
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:31,211
Your foe has bloodied you, sir knight.
Will you concede defeat?

481
00:40:33,903 --> 00:40:36,805
You fight too well to die so mean a death.

482
00:40:36,975 --> 00:40:39,463
Will you not throw in your lot
with me instead?

483
00:40:39,824 --> 00:40:42,311
That would be an even meaner death,
Your Grace.

484
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,120
Lower your lance.

485
00:40:56,272 --> 00:40:59,119
By laws of chivalry,
you've earned the right to choose...

486
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,997
...who shall be queen of love and beauty
at our sport.

487
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:04,459
It is our pleasure you shall appoint her...

488
00:41:04,624 --> 00:41:09,610
...so that one, at least, shall mourn you
when you lie cold beneath your shield.

489
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:47,469
A Saxon queen.

490
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:50,252
Confound the dog!
Is there no end to his insults?

491
00:41:50,418 --> 00:41:53,135
- Why does he plague me so?
- Forget him, Your Highness.

492
00:41:53,298 --> 00:41:56,200
His strutting cannot harm you.
You're too well-loved.

493
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:00,974
Wake up. The crown is not so firmly on my
head that I can let a rebel tilt at it in public.

494
00:42:01,137 --> 00:42:03,144
You speak of the dead, Your Highness.

495
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:08,681
- He now faces Bois-Guilbert.
- I hope he cleaves him so he splits in two.

496
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,660
We know you, sir knight.

497
00:42:11,826 --> 00:42:15,470
From this moment on, at any time,
at any price, we are your men.

498
00:43:34,484 --> 00:43:35,913
My son.

499
00:43:36,308 --> 00:43:38,512
Milord, your place is at his side.

500
00:43:38,676 --> 00:43:40,400
Go to him and forgive him.

501
00:43:40,565 --> 00:43:44,907
Go instead, to see that his wounds are cared
for. Then come to tell me how he fares.

502
00:43:45,076 --> 00:43:47,247
But never let him know I sent you.

503
00:43:55,061 --> 00:44:00,146
He will not let me touch him, milady, but
he'll die from loss of blood if we leave him.

504
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:03,058
He shall not be left here,
and I shall not let him die.

505
00:44:03,221 --> 00:44:05,043
Sir squire, fetch a litter.

506
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:17,487
Ivanhoe.

507
00:44:17,973 --> 00:44:19,151
Ivanhoe.

508
00:44:25,942 --> 00:44:27,884
I failed you, Rowena...

509
00:44:28,054 --> 00:44:29,909
...as I failed my king.

510
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,688
You have won the king's first victory.

511
00:44:32,854 --> 00:44:34,032
No.

512
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:36,907
Not until I have defeated Bois-Guilbert.

513
00:44:39,062 --> 00:44:42,291
Wamba, go find a physician
and bring him here at once!

514
00:44:42,454 --> 00:44:43,731
No physician, milady.

515
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:45,650
He's bled enough.

516
00:44:46,742 --> 00:44:48,652
Who are you to say what shall be done?

517
00:44:49,718 --> 00:44:52,500
I was taught medicine
by Miriam of Manassas...

518
00:44:52,662 --> 00:44:54,004
...and I can heal him.

519
00:44:54,454 --> 00:44:58,382
Miriam of Manassas? But she was a witch.
They burned her at the stake.

520
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:03,276
Yes, milady, as they well may burn me too.
But the point of De Bracy's lance...

521
00:45:03,446 --> 00:45:06,829
...is still deep within that wound.
If it is probed for here...

522
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:09,617
...not even you could answer for his life.

523
00:45:10,647 --> 00:45:13,494
How can I be sure what you're telling me
is the truth?

524
00:45:13,975 --> 00:45:16,277
Shall I argue with you while he dies?

525
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:17,999
I can heal him, milady.

526
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:21,745
If you can say the same, take him.
If you cannot, stand aside.

527
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:23,569
Stand aside, for you?

528
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:27,501
No, milady.

529
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:29,812
For Ivanhoe.

530
00:45:32,184 --> 00:45:34,126
How did you come to know him?

531
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:37,839
My father knows him, milady, not I.

532
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:42,739
- Where will you take him?
- To my father's house in Sheffield.

533
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,317
I leave him in your care.

534
00:45:47,255 --> 00:45:48,816
I shall not fail him.

535
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:51,925
May I send his squire for the litter?

536
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:55,122
- Do as the lady bids, Wamba.
- Yes, milady.

537
00:45:58,072 --> 00:46:00,461
Swear to me his wound will mend.

538
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,450
His wound will mend.

539
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:10,419
You love him.

540
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:15,086
Why, I told you,
I hardly know him, milady.

541
00:46:20,537 --> 00:46:22,424
How shall I know how he fares?

542
00:46:22,776 --> 00:46:25,493
I will send word to you
by his squire, milady.

543
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:28,374
I will await it.

544
00:46:40,729 --> 00:46:42,518
- Well?
- He is in good hands, milord.

545
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:45,496
- His wounds, are they slight or heavy?
- Heavy, milord.

546
00:46:45,657 --> 00:46:48,472
They'll carry him to Sheffield.
He will be tended there.

547
00:46:48,634 --> 00:46:52,343
We'll go to Sheffield till he's out of danger.
See he never hears of it...

548
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:55,986
...or he'll think I've softened into dotage.
Hundebert! The horses!

549
00:46:56,154 --> 00:46:58,041
Roast your liver.

550
00:47:35,034 --> 00:47:38,995
To the confusion and confounding
of that cursed death's-head knight.

551
00:47:39,162 --> 00:47:42,904
- Why couldn't you fools kill him on the field?
- Because he was no fool.

552
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:45,401
How can a Norman hold the throne
of England...

553
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:47,570
...when his knights go down like chaff...

554
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,714
...beneath an unknown
Saxon mountebank?

555
00:47:49,883 --> 00:47:51,792
Neither a mountebank nor yet unknown.

556
00:47:51,963 --> 00:47:54,451
I rode against that knight at Acre,
in the war.

557
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:55,830
Then tell us who he is.

558
00:47:56,379 --> 00:48:00,471
The favored henchman of your brother
Richard, my liege. Wilfred of Ivanhoe.

559
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,762
Ivanhoe? Here in England?
You told me he was dead!

560
00:48:03,931 --> 00:48:07,346
He should be, and he shall be
when he and I meet again.

561
00:48:07,515 --> 00:48:10,832
I carry his death warrant here
against my breast.

562
00:48:11,003 --> 00:48:12,214
Then why is he here?

563
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:16,052
Where else but among Saxons
would he seek the ransom for his Richard?

564
00:48:16,636 --> 00:48:17,814
Do you know this?

565
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:21,624
Nay. I do but trust my nose,
sniffing like a badger in a wood.

566
00:48:21,788 --> 00:48:24,505
To whom did Ivanhoe tip his lance
in gallantry today?

567
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:28,214
To a Jewess named Rebecca, daughter
of Isaac, the banker of his tribe.

568
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,380
What could he want of the Jews
except money for the ransom?

569
00:48:31,548 --> 00:48:34,964
- Where is he now?
- Not far from the money, if I know Ivanhoe.

570
00:48:35,132 --> 00:48:38,875
I empower you to find and seize him
and every man who's tried to help him.

571
00:48:39,037 --> 00:48:42,485
- Their women too?
- Their women, their servants, their dogs.

572
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:43,994
I want every creature...

573
00:48:44,156 --> 00:48:47,539
...Saxon, Jew or Norman,
who's had a hand in aiding Richard.

574
00:48:47,709 --> 00:48:49,847
But most urgently, I want Ivanhoe...

575
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:53,274
...no matter what it costs.
- You shall have him, my liege.

576
00:48:53,437 --> 00:48:56,568
Set about it. De Bracy, go with him.
Front De Boeuf, you too.

577
00:48:56,732 --> 00:48:58,293
Aye, my liege.

578
00:48:58,525 --> 00:49:01,111
So the plum drops ripe
into your outstretched hand.

579
00:49:01,277 --> 00:49:03,316
Into mine or no one's.

580
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:42,358
I love you.

581
00:50:43,647 --> 00:50:45,535
And I must not feel it.

582
00:50:46,912 --> 00:50:49,181
And yet I love you, Ivanhoe...

583
00:50:50,016 --> 00:50:53,114
...with all the longing in the lonely world.

584
00:51:04,097 --> 00:51:06,486
- How is he?
- All is well with him, Father.

585
00:51:07,104 --> 00:51:08,795
And with you?

586
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:14,201
I've not been blind to the loneliness
of your life, my child.

587
00:51:14,368 --> 00:51:18,263
The happiness you long for is real,
and all men long for it...

588
00:51:18,433 --> 00:51:21,084
...but you will not find it here.

589
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,764
This knight's faith forbids him
to look upon you as a woman...

590
00:51:24,928 --> 00:51:28,224
...even as yours forbids you to look
upon him as a man.

591
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,418
Then why does it not also forbid me
to feel joy or sorrow?

592
00:51:31,585 --> 00:51:33,724
It tries to teach you that as well.

593
00:51:33,889 --> 00:51:35,416
Then it has failed.

594
00:51:35,585 --> 00:51:38,749
If our teachings are false,
they will pass away...

595
00:51:38,914 --> 00:51:42,656
...but until that time,
we must abide by them.

596
00:51:43,554 --> 00:51:45,593
Perish by them, you mean.

597
00:51:49,922 --> 00:51:52,060
My heart is breaking, Father.

598
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:54,746
My heart broke long ago...

599
00:51:54,914 --> 00:51:57,729
...but it serves me still.

600
00:52:15,138 --> 00:52:19,394
My daughter brought you back here
and tended your wound, Sir Ivanhoe.

601
00:52:20,866 --> 00:52:23,354
Again, you come to my aid.

602
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:25,336
And you, Isaac.

603
00:52:26,082 --> 00:52:28,188
Rest peacefully, sir knight.

604
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:31,071
The ransom is growing
even while we speak...

605
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:34,333
...some here in Sheffield,
but most in York.

606
00:52:34,498 --> 00:52:37,466
When you can,
we will journey there to gather it.

607
00:52:37,634 --> 00:52:38,911
We?

608
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,618
You've risked enough.

609
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:44,510
Stay here in safety, Rebecca.

610
00:52:44,931 --> 00:52:47,746
What place in England is safe
until the ransom is paid?

611
00:52:47,907 --> 00:52:50,143
And you said you loved not England.

612
00:52:53,123 --> 00:52:55,873
- Locksley seeks word with you, sire.
- Sir Ivanhoe...

613
00:52:56,035 --> 00:52:59,996
...Prince John's jackals are upon you.
They know it's you and that Isaac aided.

614
00:53:00,164 --> 00:53:02,466
And John's sent Bois-Guilbert
to seize you.

615
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:04,226
Will you be safe in York?

616
00:53:04,388 --> 00:53:06,297
- Yes, Sir Ivanhoe.
- Then get you there.

617
00:53:06,468 --> 00:53:10,243
- They'll break down every door in Sheffield.
- Not every door. Not Cedric's.

618
00:53:10,404 --> 00:53:13,633
- Or he'll bring the roof about their ears.
- Cedric in Sheffield?

619
00:53:13,796 --> 00:53:16,382
Yes, sire, to hear news of you.

620
00:53:16,548 --> 00:53:21,185
Take this lady and her father to him.
Beg him for protection as far as Rotherwood.

621
00:53:21,348 --> 00:53:25,952
I'll join you in York as soon as I can ride
again. Guard your charges with your life...

622
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:28,123
...until they're safe in York.
- I will.

623
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,983
Go, then, at once.

624
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:35,643
We'll hide you in the forest
till your wounds are healed.

625
00:53:52,581 --> 00:53:54,304
- No one here.
- What did you expect?

626
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:57,764
They had wind of us and flew the trap,
your ladybird with them.

627
00:53:57,925 --> 00:53:59,899
They'll not have flown far.

628
00:54:00,485 --> 00:54:03,519
- I've traced Isaac and his daughter.
- Where are they?

629
00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:06,368
On the way to Rotherwood
under Cedric's protection.

630
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:09,632
- And Ivanhoe?
- Fled to the forest with Locksley's rebels.

631
00:54:09,797 --> 00:54:11,324
Then we take the father first.

632
00:54:11,493 --> 00:54:15,716
- Take Cedric and rouse all Saxon England?
- John gave me full powers. I'll use them.

633
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,114
Once we hold Cedric,
we'll smoke out Ivanhoe.

634
00:54:18,278 --> 00:54:20,318
- Assemble the men. We ride at once.
- Aye.

635
00:54:20,486 --> 00:54:21,696
Guilbert.

636
00:54:21,862 --> 00:54:24,862
- Have you weighed this well?
- Yes.

637
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,037
I'll risk all on one throw and win.

638
00:54:27,206 --> 00:54:30,435
Win what? A Jewess or a hornet's nest?

639
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:42,365
Squire Wamba.

640
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:44,059
Squire Wamba!

641
00:54:44,227 --> 00:54:46,715
I'll squire you, you renegade.

642
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:50,496
- I'll collar that neck again or wring it.
- Touched, milord.

643
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,311
Is that the tone for one gentleman
to use to another?

644
00:54:53,476 --> 00:54:58,298
Out of my sight before my wrath boils over
and I squash you like a plum!

645
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:02,371
I left Ivanhoe in your care to nurse
until his wound was healed.

646
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:06,329
And now you ride beside me as calmly
as I would ride to church.

647
00:55:07,076 --> 00:55:09,313
Do you infidels never show your feelings?

648
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:11,843
We are taught not to have them, milady.

649
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:14,268
Will you see Ivanhoe in York?

650
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,614
I do not know, milady.

651
00:55:15,781 --> 00:55:17,057
But you hope to.

652
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,075
Yes, I hope to.

653
00:55:19,492 --> 00:55:21,664
Does he know we quarreled
over him at Ashby?

654
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:23,039
No, milady.

655
00:55:24,101 --> 00:55:26,305
Does a Jew feel jealousy?

656
00:55:27,045 --> 00:55:28,354
Yes, milady.

657
00:55:28,709 --> 00:55:32,058
Then they're not so different
from the Saxon, after all.

658
00:55:49,701 --> 00:55:51,392
Death to the Norman dogs!

659
00:55:51,558 --> 00:55:53,532
God save England!

660
00:55:54,149 --> 00:55:56,189
God save Wamba.

661
00:56:32,454 --> 00:56:35,269
I bid you right welcome to my keep,
Sir Cedric.

662
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:39,937
Your keep. Torquilstone was cursed forever
when you put your Norman foot across it.

663
00:56:40,103 --> 00:56:43,518
Talk sweeter, Saxon, or I'll put my
Norman foot across your neck!

664
00:57:17,736 --> 00:57:19,940
A horseman approaching from the south!

665
00:57:40,137 --> 00:57:42,079
Milord, it's Ivanhoe.

666
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,190
- Ivanhoe.
- Yes, milord.

667
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,564
Coming like a lamb to the butcher.

668
00:57:46,728 --> 00:57:49,183
So we see his face at last.

669
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:17,539
Bois-Guilbert, you hold my father
and his train.

670
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:20,005
This issue concerns only the two of us.

671
00:58:20,169 --> 00:58:23,235
I charge you to release them
and make your case with me.

672
00:58:23,401 --> 00:58:25,823
What is your bargain,
if I let the rest go free?

673
00:58:26,218 --> 00:58:31,553
I'll surrender for fair trial before Prince John
if they are no longer prisoners in an hour.

674
00:58:31,882 --> 00:58:34,304
Clap the dog in irons
and have done with him.

675
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,639
Come forward and surrender,
and the rest shall go free.

676
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:01,567
By the authority conferred upon me
by Prince John, you're my prisoner, Ivanhoe.

677
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:07,113
You do not fool us, Ivanhoe.

678
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:11,431
No man gives himself up to his enemies
like a drunken apple woman. What's afoot?

679
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:15,394
Are you afraid of what
one unarmed man might do?

680
00:59:15,563 --> 00:59:18,530
I ask time alone with my father
to make my peace with him.

681
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:22,561
- Let him go and take me before Prince John.
- You shall see your father alone.

682
00:59:22,731 --> 00:59:26,822
Take this knight to his father,
but guard him well. Go with him, De Bracy.

683
00:59:26,987 --> 00:59:31,330
- I am in your debt, Bois-Guilbert.
- You shall repay it, Ivanhoe.

684
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,562
Here's the old bull's pen.

685
00:59:43,724 --> 00:59:46,026
He's roared himself silent, it would seem.

686
00:59:47,948 --> 00:59:50,948
Show your head,
and I'll knock it off your neck!

687
00:59:51,115 --> 00:59:53,352
A reunion should be touching.

688
00:59:58,188 --> 01:00:01,287
Are you such a ninny
that you let them catch you too?

689
01:00:01,452 --> 01:00:03,208
I'm the only one they want.

690
01:00:03,372 --> 01:00:07,049
- Bois-Guilbert pledged that you can go free.
- And leave you here to hang?

691
01:00:08,364 --> 01:00:11,845
Be still and hear me. Locksley
and his bowmen are all around us...

692
01:00:12,012 --> 01:00:15,362
...but you're the only leader skilled
in siege to take this keep.

693
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:17,442
He's waiting for you. Go to him.

694
01:00:17,612 --> 01:00:19,652
Aye, right willingly.

695
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:23,912
You went with Richard in defiance
of my will, but all's forgotten, boy.

696
01:00:24,077 --> 01:00:25,964
Perhaps you'll listen next time.

697
01:00:33,581 --> 01:00:35,304
My father is ready to leave.

698
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:39,081
So he shall, when you've told us where
Richard's ransom money is hidden.

699
01:00:39,245 --> 01:00:43,337
- Take them to the dungeons and bind them.
- This is the way you pledge your word!

700
01:00:43,502 --> 01:00:47,080
You cursed Norman!
Bois-Guilbert, you shall hang for this!

701
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:52,771
Lvanhoe! Lvanhoe!

702
01:00:56,174 --> 01:00:57,832
I heard Ivanhoe's voice.

703
01:00:57,998 --> 01:00:59,820
You did indeed, milady.

704
01:00:59,982 --> 01:01:01,706
And I hope you heard it clearly.

705
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,717
It'll be many a long year
before you hear it again.

706
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:07,656
If Prince John harms Sir Ivanhoe...

707
01:01:07,822 --> 01:01:12,012
...may the curse of every Saxon bring ruin
and disaster upon the heads of you all.

708
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:16,109
May death blight you as you stand
and walk and ride and sleep.

709
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:20,460
Curse Prince John all you wish, but he'll
still put England's crown upon his head.

710
01:01:20,622 --> 01:01:22,989
And I shall sit at his feet
when he's king.

711
01:01:23,502 --> 01:01:25,804
So will you. We are neither of us fools.

712
01:01:25,966 --> 01:01:27,592
- We?
- Yes, we.

713
01:01:28,015 --> 01:01:30,666
You are the last in line
of the old Saxon royalty.

714
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:33,765
Now that Cedric can't find a Saxon king
for you to marry...

715
01:01:33,935 --> 01:01:36,935
...I am, by far, the most eligible
of the new order.

716
01:01:37,103 --> 01:01:40,234
- Are you mad?
- No, dear lady, only ambitious.

717
01:01:40,399 --> 01:01:42,821
I have a taste for beauty
and a love for money...

718
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:44,397
...and you have both.

719
01:01:48,431 --> 01:01:51,628
I see I shall have to mend
your Saxon manners for you.

720
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,613
Even that will be a pleasure.

721
01:02:02,672 --> 01:02:05,006
Come in. Come in, Sir Ivanhoe.

722
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:08,039
We were about to tickle
the old Jew into speech...

723
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:12,844
...but you'll take precedence, being a Saxon
knight. String him up beside the other.

724
01:02:17,551 --> 01:02:20,268
- Delay the questioning till I return.
- Return fast...

725
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:24,523
...or 150,000 marks of silver may go.
- I shall be swift.

726
01:02:36,976 --> 01:02:39,278
What have you done with my father?

727
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,237
Front De Boeuf plays host to him,
as I play host to you.

728
01:02:44,977 --> 01:02:47,049
May God have mercy on him, then.

729
01:02:47,216 --> 01:02:49,322
We are merciful men, Rebecca...

730
01:02:49,488 --> 01:02:51,277
...when our mercy is appealed to.

731
01:02:52,497 --> 01:02:57,134
If you hold us for a price, name it. Our
people will raise it if my father is unharmed.

732
01:02:57,521 --> 01:02:59,463
Your people cannot pay it.

733
01:02:59,633 --> 01:03:01,673
You are the price, Rebecca...

734
01:03:01,841 --> 01:03:04,525
...and I am the collector of the debt.

735
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:08,489
Then you are a false coward
who believes in nothing...

736
01:03:08,657 --> 01:03:10,894
...least of all your vows of chivalry.

737
01:03:11,057 --> 01:03:14,919
On the contrary, my vows of chivalry
bid me slay the infidel...

738
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:17,741
...but my heart is stronger than my sword.

739
01:03:18,226 --> 01:03:20,877
I shall possess you, Rebecca,
if I die for it.

740
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:31,719
Try to possess me,
and we shall both die for it.

741
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,410
I now, and you when Richard
returns to England.

742
01:03:34,706 --> 01:03:37,072
You deny me because of Ivanhoe,
do you not?

743
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:41,511
What would you say if he were within these
walls, held captive with the rest of you?

744
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:44,753
I would despise you for a liar.

745
01:03:44,914 --> 01:03:46,702
Nevertheless, he is here.

746
01:03:47,762 --> 01:03:49,256
You don't believe me, do you?

747
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:53,616
How, then, if I say he came delivering
himself as a hostage for his father...

748
01:03:53,778 --> 01:03:57,226
...and we took him without violence?
Still not enough?

749
01:03:58,131 --> 01:04:02,703
How, then, if the bandage on the shoulder
of his shield arm were of fine linen...

750
01:04:02,867 --> 01:04:06,063
...and if the linen were fastened
with a golden pin?

751
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:12,680
I believe you.

752
01:04:13,235 --> 01:04:15,952
Then believe this also.
He cannot save you.

753
01:04:16,115 --> 01:04:17,676
But you can save him...

754
01:04:17,843 --> 01:04:19,436
...not by dying, but by living.

755
01:04:20,211 --> 01:04:22,546
If you die, so does he and all the rest.

756
01:04:33,075 --> 01:04:35,661
There are many ways of dying...

757
01:04:35,828 --> 01:04:37,770
...and this is the basest.

758
01:04:41,299 --> 01:04:45,074
You mistake the nature of our bargain,
Rebecca. I want you alive, not dead.

759
01:04:45,236 --> 01:04:48,335
When next I come to you,
meet me with desire in your breast...

760
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,769
...or no man's life is saved.

761
01:04:55,189 --> 01:04:56,977
The fire's at white heat, milord.

762
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:02,224
Tell us where the ransom's hidden,
and I'll make your dying fast instead of slow.

763
01:05:02,388 --> 01:05:04,723
If you harm him, you Norman dog...

764
01:05:04,885 --> 01:05:07,536
...every Saxon in England
will avenge his blood.

765
01:05:10,293 --> 01:05:12,333
Ever seen half a beef turning on a spit?

766
01:05:12,501 --> 01:05:16,243
I've seen whole traitors.
Well-basted, they drip a rich, red gravy.

767
01:05:24,597 --> 01:05:28,078
I command you, deliver up the captives
that you hold...

768
01:05:28,245 --> 01:05:30,481
...or suffer siege and attack!

769
01:05:30,645 --> 01:05:33,231
This demand, we make but once!

770
01:05:33,621 --> 01:05:36,305
Shall we hire him for a jester
or hang him for a lout?

771
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:39,885
Get you gone from here before we flay you
for your empty boasting!

772
01:05:40,054 --> 01:05:42,988
I'll show you how emptily I boast.

773
01:06:02,102 --> 01:06:04,174
Where's your laughter, Norman?

774
01:06:04,342 --> 01:06:06,764
Does my jest fall flat?

775
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:22,614
Another blast on that horn
and even the trees will come alive.

776
01:06:22,774 --> 01:06:25,774
- Have you men enough to hold the keep?
- Against that rabble?

777
01:06:25,942 --> 01:06:28,430
- Twice as many as I need.
- I doubt it.

778
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:30,933
That rabble's drunk with hate of us.

779
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:33,493
Then let us feed their hate.

780
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:35,597
Bring Ivanhoe to the battlement.

781
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:53,014
Cut him down.

782
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:07,407
Ready arrows!

783
01:07:15,576 --> 01:07:17,681
I'll have your answer, Normans!

784
01:07:19,256 --> 01:07:21,809
You have it, Saxon! Look, you.

785
01:07:34,328 --> 01:07:37,744
One false move, and your knight shall hang
before your eyes.

786
01:07:37,912 --> 01:07:39,735
Now, take your men and get you gone.

787
01:07:39,993 --> 01:07:44,084
Hold fast, Locksley! In the name of Richard,
attack and wipe them out!

788
01:07:44,249 --> 01:07:46,224
Why waste good rope?

789
01:07:46,393 --> 01:07:48,978
This is how we deliver up
the captives that we hold.

790
01:07:49,145 --> 01:07:50,967
Here comes the first!

791
01:07:51,705 --> 01:07:54,126
Cut me loose or I take your master
to his death!

792
01:07:54,297 --> 01:07:57,843
Cut nothing or I'll cut your throats!
If he has me, I also have him.

793
01:07:58,489 --> 01:08:00,562
De Boeuf's a brave enough fool.

794
01:08:00,729 --> 01:08:02,485
Too brave to lose.

795
01:08:02,649 --> 01:08:03,925
Cut him loose!

796
01:08:04,089 --> 01:08:05,715
I order it!

797
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:24,560
Away arrows!

798
01:08:27,386 --> 01:08:28,880
After him!

799
01:08:33,594 --> 01:08:35,666
- Blast! I lost him!
- We'll catch him soon.

800
01:08:35,834 --> 01:08:38,584
- Look to your men. We're under siege.
- Sound the alarm!

801
01:08:38,746 --> 01:08:42,707
Up drawbridge! Down portcullis!
Trumpets, sound every man to post!

802
01:08:42,874 --> 01:08:45,624
Armor and swords!
To the drawbridge!

803
01:09:29,596 --> 01:09:31,254
How goes it with us?

804
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:33,143
Locksley's attacking.

805
01:09:34,204 --> 01:09:35,895
Show me a Norman throat.

806
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,522
Can Saxons fight?

807
01:09:37,691 --> 01:09:40,888
- All day and through the night!
- All day and through the night!

808
01:10:14,684 --> 01:10:17,848
It works for us! Feed it! Keep it going!

809
01:10:26,845 --> 01:10:28,187
Hold!

810
01:10:29,757 --> 01:10:31,317
Forward!

811
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:39,543
They're going to charge us
from the drawbridge gate.

812
01:10:39,709 --> 01:10:41,564
Stand ready with your bows!

813
01:11:15,903 --> 01:11:19,797
- Corked in like cider in a jug, eh?
- And now to burst the jug.

814
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,938
To the walls!

815
01:11:37,343 --> 01:11:38,968
The keep's afire.

816
01:11:39,135 --> 01:11:41,590
This time, men must go
where arrows went before.

817
01:11:41,759 --> 01:11:45,785
- Can you take the barbican?
- What, that dog kennel? Single-handed.

818
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:49,366
Take it, then.
They can't fight fire and Saxons.

819
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,833
De Boeuf!

820
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:02,744
- Take 12 men and stamp that fire out.
- Hold!

821
01:12:07,232 --> 01:12:11,509
- The fire must wait. We need your men.
- Then I'll do it myself, with two to help.

822
01:13:27,298 --> 01:13:29,883
- What next, milord?
- Our women next. Where's Rowena?

823
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:32,636
- Close to the cell they locked me in.
- And Rebecca?

824
01:13:32,802 --> 01:13:36,763
- We must look for her.
- No! Look for me, and look your last!

825
01:14:00,675 --> 01:14:02,431
Make ready the boulders!

826
01:14:08,003 --> 01:14:09,498
Away!

827
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:06,752
Rowena.

828
01:16:30,215 --> 01:16:32,549
Come on! Hurry!

829
01:16:33,223 --> 01:16:35,612
Faster! Faster! Ram!

830
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:40,934
Faster! Ram!

831
01:16:41,095 --> 01:16:43,681
Ram! Ram!

832
01:17:05,736 --> 01:17:09,184
The barbican's fallen. We've lost
the castle. It's the end of us all.

833
01:17:09,352 --> 01:17:12,003
There's one chance left.
Not noble, but our last.

834
01:17:12,168 --> 01:17:13,990
We could force through on horseback.

835
01:17:14,152 --> 01:17:18,343
- Run before them, we two?
- We four. We use the women as our shields.

836
01:17:39,401 --> 01:17:41,889
Come with me quickly!
The castle's in flames!

837
01:17:46,665 --> 01:17:50,080
- Follow me. You're in danger.
- I'll die before I'll follow you.

838
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:52,551
No time for lovers' quarrels.
You will roast.

839
01:17:53,065 --> 01:17:56,131
- Why make me use...
- Turn and defend yourself, De Bracy!

840
01:18:15,753 --> 01:18:17,761
Enough. I cry quarter.

841
01:18:17,929 --> 01:18:19,456
Where have you hidden Rebecca?

842
01:18:19,626 --> 01:18:21,252
I fear you'll be too late.

843
01:18:21,418 --> 01:18:23,807
Bois-Guilbert has fled with her.

844
01:18:29,354 --> 01:18:31,143
Down drawbridge!

845
01:18:41,066 --> 01:18:43,303
Hold your arrows! The maid's with him!

846
01:19:07,692 --> 01:19:11,816
So Torquilstone is lost,
and you are our only prisoner, infidel.

847
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,768
Your pardon, my liege. My prisoner.

848
01:19:13,931 --> 01:19:15,492
- Our prisoner.
- But, my liege...

849
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:19,718
Return to your keep until my plans are made
and I send for you again.

850
01:19:19,883 --> 01:19:22,785
- What of my prisoner?
- She will remain within these walls.

851
01:19:22,955 --> 01:19:25,290
- My liege...
- You have our leave to go hence.

852
01:19:36,876 --> 01:19:41,000
Your defeat at Torquilstone can still be
twisted to advantage, Your Highness.

853
01:19:41,164 --> 01:19:43,498
With the castle burned,
the good Boeuf dead...

854
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:47,076
...and Ivanhoe running loose,
gathering that infernal ransom...

855
01:19:47,244 --> 01:19:50,660
...with both hands?
- And the maid Rebecca in your hands.

856
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:55,585
A sorceress, taught by a witch
who was burnt at the stake.

857
01:19:55,756 --> 01:19:59,685
- And you believe that nonsense?
- No, but your people shall.

858
01:19:59,852 --> 01:20:05,220
I think you have the spade with which
to bury Richard at last.

859
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:25,128
Who needs more wealth
for Richard's ransom?

860
01:20:25,294 --> 01:20:26,668
We're the new rich, milord.

861
01:20:26,829 --> 01:20:29,218
We bank for the Normans
and lend to the Saxons.

862
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:31,845
From a Norman who has
no further use for it.

863
01:20:32,014 --> 01:20:33,802
He plays a harp instead.

864
01:20:34,286 --> 01:20:37,635
And this from his lady,
who gave everything she had to the poor.

865
01:20:37,806 --> 01:20:39,780
Bless her generous nature.

866
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:43,179
Disclose no more former owners,
you villain...

867
01:20:43,342 --> 01:20:45,579
...lest my name be among them.

868
01:20:45,742 --> 01:20:48,742
- Is this enough yet?
- Not yet.

869
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:57,995
From the people of Israel,
100,000 marks of silver.

870
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:02,217
So do we fulfill our part of the pledge
to ransom Richard.

871
01:21:02,383 --> 01:21:06,474
One hundred thousand marks of silver
in that scrap of nothing?

872
01:21:06,638 --> 01:21:09,321
We need help for Richard
that a man can see and touch.

873
01:21:09,486 --> 01:21:12,835
That scrap of nothing
is not nothing, milord.

874
01:21:13,006 --> 01:21:16,716
There are merchants in Vienna
who owe sums to our people in York.

875
01:21:16,879 --> 01:21:21,865
These writings call on our debtors
to pay what they owe in Austrian gold.

876
01:21:22,031 --> 01:21:26,821
Can you also convert this weighty trash
to writings?

877
01:21:26,991 --> 01:21:28,747
It shall be done.

878
01:21:29,231 --> 01:21:30,692
My son.

879
01:21:31,855 --> 01:21:34,506
- Have you news of Rebecca?
- Aye, at last.

880
01:21:34,831 --> 01:21:37,002
Isaac, prepare your heart
for evil tidings.

881
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:40,942
Prince John holds your daughter captive
in the royal castle at Wallingford.

882
01:21:41,103 --> 01:21:42,761
What is the charge against her?

883
01:21:43,087 --> 01:21:46,535
I do not know. But you have 40 days
in which to find the ransom.

884
01:21:46,704 --> 01:21:50,282
One hundred thousand marks of silver,
the very sum you give to Richard.

885
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:52,389
Can you raise as much again?

886
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,805
John knew that when he named the sum.

887
01:21:57,968 --> 01:22:02,092
Then use what you have to free Rebecca.
We'll search again to find the ransom.

888
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:06,250
We lose a king,
or you lose your child.

889
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:09,006
Your will is ours, Isaac.

890
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:14,412
My will is God's.

891
01:22:15,216 --> 01:22:16,678
Free the king.

892
01:22:17,777 --> 01:22:20,843
Richard would not accept his throne
at such a price.

893
01:22:21,009 --> 01:22:25,286
My daughter does not die
to save Richard's throne, Sir Ivanhoe.

894
01:22:25,457 --> 01:22:28,043
She dies to save her people.

895
01:22:28,912 --> 01:22:32,742
Then I pledge my word to put all else aside
until she's free again.

896
01:22:32,913 --> 01:22:35,149
But the ransom.
Who will take it to Austria?

897
01:22:35,312 --> 01:22:38,574
- You will, sire.
- Aye, that I will.

898
01:22:49,073 --> 01:22:50,480
Why are you so pale?

899
01:22:50,641 --> 01:22:52,496
Are you afraid for me?

900
01:22:53,746 --> 01:22:56,233
I shall only know that
when Rebecca is free.

901
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:58,376
That will be soon.

902
01:22:58,769 --> 01:23:01,322
But will Ivanhoe still be Ivanhoe?

903
01:23:01,489 --> 01:23:03,856
A man torn is two men.

904
01:23:04,017 --> 01:23:05,872
I will still be Ivanhoe.

905
01:23:06,578 --> 01:23:08,650
Perhaps, and perhaps not.

906
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:12,113
The choice is yours, Ivanhoe,
not mine and not Rebecca's.

907
01:23:12,274 --> 01:23:15,089
Do you think I go to her aid
because I love her?

908
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:20,106
I shall know that when I know
where pity ends and love begins.

909
01:23:21,266 --> 01:23:23,176
I am afraid, Ivanhoe...

910
01:23:23,346 --> 01:23:24,972
...and I am jealous.

911
01:23:25,842 --> 01:23:27,303
Go and free her.

912
01:23:27,922 --> 01:23:29,100
Farewell.

913
01:24:24,051 --> 01:24:28,078
Rise, infidel, so that the court
may gaze upon your face.

914
01:24:35,444 --> 01:24:38,761
The infidel, Rebecca of York,
stands accused of the foul crimes...

915
01:24:38,932 --> 01:24:40,874
...of sorcery and black magic.

916
01:24:41,044 --> 01:24:42,670
Let her trial begin.

917
01:24:43,604 --> 01:24:47,182
The witness, Roger of Bermondsley,
a soldier at arms.

918
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,759
Tell the court what you know
of this woman.

919
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:54,608
At the castle of Torquilstone...

920
01:24:54,772 --> 01:24:59,758
...with my own eyes I saw this accused
perched on the highest parapet of the tower.

921
01:24:59,924 --> 01:25:04,267
With my own ears I heard her call
upon the powers of darkness.

922
01:25:04,853 --> 01:25:07,341
Forthwith, she was changed
into a black swan...

923
01:25:07,509 --> 01:25:12,364
...which three times circled the castle
and returned to the tower...

924
01:25:12,533 --> 01:25:15,501
...and was again this accused!

925
01:25:15,669 --> 01:25:17,938
- My lord!
- The tribunal will address you...

926
01:25:18,101 --> 01:25:22,095
...when fitting, knight. Until then,
be you silent or quit this court!

927
01:25:28,085 --> 01:25:32,461
I draw my wage, milords, as servant
to Isaac of York in Sheffield town.

928
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:35,117
Some nights past,
I heard the sound of chanting...

929
01:25:35,286 --> 01:25:37,009
...and I looked through a keyhole.

930
01:25:37,173 --> 01:25:40,370
Through this I saw the body of a knight
lying dead on a pallet.

931
01:25:40,534 --> 01:25:43,698
Above him crouched this evil spirit...

932
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:46,514
...speaking in a soft tongue...

933
01:25:46,678 --> 01:25:50,126
...and lo, the knight stirred
and came back to life again.

934
01:25:50,294 --> 01:25:51,636
Can you name this knight?

935
01:25:52,054 --> 01:25:54,421
The name Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe
was spoken...

936
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:58,030
...and he rose and replied as alive as me.

937
01:25:58,198 --> 01:25:59,573
You may go.

938
01:26:01,622 --> 01:26:04,721
Forgive me, milady! They made me say it!

939
01:26:10,935 --> 01:26:15,157
The words of Sir Brian De Bois-Guilbert
to the accused were these:

940
01:26:15,318 --> 01:26:18,002
"I confess to living under a spell.

941
01:26:18,167 --> 01:26:20,917
Who could cast it so well as you?

942
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:25,519
Who could bind me so fast
except a sorceress?"

943
01:26:25,687 --> 01:26:26,996
Did the witch reply?

944
01:26:27,159 --> 01:26:29,232
Only by the use of her evil powers...

945
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:31,766
...which cast a palsy
into the knight's hand...

946
01:26:31,928 --> 01:26:33,837
...and drove him from her presence.

947
01:26:34,808 --> 01:26:37,972
My lord, he lies. This woman
is no more a witch than you or I.

948
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:42,866
What further proof do you need than that
of the knight's bewitchment?

949
01:26:44,823 --> 01:26:47,987
I lent my sanction to this inquiry
with a heavy heart...

950
01:26:48,152 --> 01:26:50,673
...but a duty seen must be discharged.

951
01:26:51,543 --> 01:26:54,194
Like a plague passing from hand to hand...

952
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,328
...so the scourge of witchcraft
spreads across this land...

953
01:26:57,496 --> 01:26:59,187
...even to men in other lands.

954
01:26:59,352 --> 01:27:01,425
Aye, even to my brother Richard.

955
01:27:01,592 --> 01:27:03,698
- No!
- No!

956
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:08,757
Aye, Richard, long sought by me
and long thought dead, has been found.

957
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,473
But better by far that he had died...

958
01:27:11,641 --> 01:27:14,957
...for he has fallen into the hands
of sorcerers and idolaters.

959
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:16,405
Consider this:

960
01:27:16,568 --> 01:27:21,751
If one of their tribe can so deprave a man
like the Saxon Ivanhoe...

961
01:27:21,912 --> 01:27:24,563
...and a man like the Norman
Bois-Guilbert...

962
01:27:24,729 --> 01:27:28,439
...what has the whole tribe done to Richard,
who is also a man?

963
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:31,959
They found him,
and with their accursed gold...

964
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:35,121
...they bought his freedom and his soul.

965
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:39,992
Now he will try to return to these shores,
but he is no longer the Richard who left.

966
01:27:40,153 --> 01:27:44,725
He is a man seduced and bewitched,
in league with the infidel against England.

967
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:47,508
Never was a king more cheaply bought.

968
01:27:47,674 --> 01:27:49,616
- No!
- No!

969
01:27:49,786 --> 01:27:54,325
I say save England without spilling
one drop of English blood.

970
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:58,134
For as the servant of the Jews,
who would call Richard English?

971
01:27:58,297 --> 01:28:00,436
I say burn this infidel!

972
01:28:00,602 --> 01:28:04,912
And with the same torch, drive her people
into the sea and Richard with them.

973
01:28:05,082 --> 01:28:06,773
- No!
- No!

974
01:28:18,234 --> 01:28:20,569
Justice of this court
allows the prisoner...

975
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:22,770
...to speak in her own defense.

976
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:28,374
I was taught healing
by Miriam of Manassas.

977
01:28:28,539 --> 01:28:29,815
That is true.

978
01:28:29,978 --> 01:28:32,215
But I have always sought
to use that skill...

979
01:28:32,379 --> 01:28:35,226
...in the service of man, to relieve his pain.

980
01:28:35,386 --> 01:28:39,063
If this convicts me of witchcraft,
and with me, my people...

981
01:28:39,451 --> 01:28:41,109
...then may God pity every man...

982
01:28:41,275 --> 01:28:43,828
...who seeks mercy and justice
from his fellow men.

983
01:28:43,995 --> 01:28:46,897
For the only merciful power
in this world is death...

984
01:28:47,067 --> 01:28:51,126
...and the only justice is beyond the grave.
I am innocent.

985
01:28:53,243 --> 01:28:56,691
Milords, before the prisoner
convicts herself out of her own mouth...

986
01:28:56,859 --> 01:28:59,641
...I demand the right to address her
before the court.

987
01:28:59,803 --> 01:29:01,975
- Shall I refuse?
- No. Let him speak.

988
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,234
Your request is granted by the court,
sir knight.

989
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:12,565
This court long ago closed its eyes
and ears to your fate, Rebecca.

990
01:29:12,731 --> 01:29:14,455
You will be found guilty...

991
01:29:14,812 --> 01:29:17,016
...and you will be burnt at the stake...

992
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:20,496
...and the ashes of your body
will be scattered to the four winds.

993
01:29:23,868 --> 01:29:27,164
I pray my people will not be ashamed
of the way I die.

994
01:29:27,868 --> 01:29:30,389
The trial cannot be halted,
but the sentence can.

995
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:32,409
When charged, confess.

996
01:29:32,572 --> 01:29:34,677
To what? Crimes I have not committed?

997
01:29:34,844 --> 01:29:36,884
No matter, confess and ask for pardon.

998
01:29:37,052 --> 01:29:38,962
They must grant it on one condition:

999
01:29:39,133 --> 01:29:41,304
That you renounce the faith of Israel.

1000
01:29:44,348 --> 01:29:46,715
I would not live in the world you offer.

1001
01:29:47,453 --> 01:29:51,195
It has neither sun nor moon,
nor air to breathe.

1002
01:29:51,613 --> 01:29:55,541
It has no faith, no love, no honor.

1003
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:59,319
When you leave it,
I think it will have no life.

1004
01:30:02,429 --> 01:30:05,331
Enough. You waste the time of the court.
Proceed.

1005
01:30:05,629 --> 01:30:07,800
It is the solemn judgment of this court...

1006
01:30:07,965 --> 01:30:10,616
...that Rebecca of York be pronounced
a witch...

1007
01:30:10,781 --> 01:30:15,603
...infected with satanic powers
and guilty of demoniacal arts.

1008
01:30:15,773 --> 01:30:19,570
For this, we abandon her
to her punishment:

1009
01:30:19,933 --> 01:30:21,689
Death by fire.

1010
01:30:21,853 --> 01:30:23,479
Hold, milords!

1011
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:37,143
I, Wilfred of Ivanhoe,
do challenge the judgment of this tribunal.

1012
01:30:37,342 --> 01:30:39,514
I demand that her guilt or innocence...

1013
01:30:39,678 --> 01:30:42,492
...be determined in the eyes of God
by wager of battle.

1014
01:30:42,846 --> 01:30:46,621
Instruct me if this wager of battle
is mandatory upon the court.

1015
01:30:46,782 --> 01:30:48,986
It is, sire. An appeal
to God's judgment...

1016
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:52,118
...cannot be denied by common
or canon law.

1017
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:55,763
Unless the accused rejects the offer
of championship.

1018
01:30:56,926 --> 01:30:58,715
What says the accused?

1019
01:31:00,254 --> 01:31:02,676
I accept the offer with all my heart.

1020
01:31:05,086 --> 01:31:08,435
- May the court choose its own champion?
- It may, sire.

1021
01:31:16,991 --> 01:31:21,661
Sir Brian De Bois-Guilbert, you shall accept
this challenge on behalf of the court.

1022
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:29,501
I do humbly accept
the honor bestowed upon me...

1023
01:31:29,663 --> 01:31:34,617
...to uphold the mercy and justice
of my prince by wager of battle.

1024
01:31:36,127 --> 01:31:37,556
Court so orders.

1025
01:31:37,727 --> 01:31:40,793
On the third day hence,
let the wager of battle be fought...

1026
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,131
...in the lists at Ashby...

1027
01:31:43,295 --> 01:31:44,856
...to the death.

1028
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:53,176
As master of the lists,
I hereby charge ye...

1029
01:32:53,346 --> 01:32:56,280
...that if either combatant violate
the laws of chivalry...

1030
01:32:56,449 --> 01:33:01,687
...I will cry, "Foul craven!" And upon
the casting of my truncheon to the ground...

1031
01:33:01,857 --> 01:33:05,469
...the offender shall instantly be slain
by the royal bowmen.

1032
01:33:08,706 --> 01:33:11,641
Rebecca, once I enter these lists
in combat...

1033
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:15,771
...I must maintain my name in arms.
And if I do so, Ivanhoe dies quickly...

1034
01:33:15,938 --> 01:33:19,899
...and then you in such pain as they say
is in store for the guilty hereafter.

1035
01:33:20,066 --> 01:33:24,125
If I withdraw now, Ivanhoe wins by default,
and you both will live...

1036
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:29,047
...while I shall fall from grace, a degraded
knight without fame and without honor.

1037
01:33:29,443 --> 01:33:32,094
All this I would endure if you would say:

1038
01:33:32,259 --> 01:33:36,536
"Bois-Guilbert, I turn from Ivanhoe to you".

1039
01:33:47,427 --> 01:33:49,697
We are all in God's hands, sir knight.

1040
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:56,322
Then count your life by seconds,
and the Saxon's life as well.

1041
01:34:09,156 --> 01:34:12,505
Since you ride for the court, Bois-Guilbert,
choose first.

1042
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:17,018
- What arm do you elect to bear?
- I bear mace and chain this day.

1043
01:34:26,148 --> 01:34:28,319
Your foe declares for close combat.

1044
01:34:28,484 --> 01:34:30,142
This denies to you the lance.

1045
01:34:30,308 --> 01:34:32,413
Therefore, elect from ax or blade.

1046
01:34:33,028 --> 01:34:34,589
I choose the ax.

1047
01:34:45,892 --> 01:34:48,926
Arm you, then, valiant sirs,
and to your stations.

1048
01:35:03,941 --> 01:35:06,275
May God defend the right.

1049
01:35:06,437 --> 01:35:08,925
May God defend the right!

1050
01:37:28,457 --> 01:37:30,945
Beware, Saxon, lest you strike horse!

1051
01:38:16,843 --> 01:38:20,291
Lvanhoe, God spare you.

1052
01:40:01,805 --> 01:40:03,714
Rebecca.

1053
01:40:07,053 --> 01:40:11,788
You must blame the Fates that it was
I who loved you and not Sir Ivanhoe.

1054
01:40:12,557 --> 01:40:14,728
But you were always mine...

1055
01:40:14,893 --> 01:40:17,349
...and only mine.

1056
01:40:17,709 --> 01:40:19,913
God keep you.

1057
01:40:37,134 --> 01:40:41,389
Milady, in death he spoke the truth.

1058
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:44,012
You still love Ivanhoe?

1059
01:40:44,654 --> 01:40:46,629
No, milady.

1060
01:40:47,215 --> 01:40:50,150
I stole a little happiness, perhaps...

1061
01:40:50,574 --> 01:40:54,088
...but not from him or you...

1062
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:56,966
...only from my dreams.

1063
01:40:57,678 --> 01:40:59,271
His heart was always yours.

1064
01:41:12,303 --> 01:41:16,013
Before me kneels a nation divided.

1065
01:41:16,687 --> 01:41:22,830
Rise as one man,
and that one for England!

1066
01:41:23,196 --> 01:41:26,396
<i>Long live England!
Long live England!</i>
