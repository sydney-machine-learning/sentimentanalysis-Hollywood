1
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,811
Some things start out big,

2
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:06,691
and some things
start out small, very small.

3
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,570
But sometimes the smallest thing...

4
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,282
can make the biggest changes of all.

5
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,279
- Yar, what is it?
- I don't know.

6
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,283
Plio, get back here!
We don't know what it is!

7
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,205
Plio, be careful.

8
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,538
Dad, get over here.

9
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:23,712
- Zini, it's not safe.
- Oh, I always have to go
when stuff's happening.

10
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,388
Well, what is it?

11
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,183
- It was an egg. Look.

12
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,229
- What?
- It's a cold-blooded monster
from across the sea.

13
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,857
- Vicious, flesh-eating.
- Blech.

14
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,110
- Eew.
- Looks like a baby to me.

15
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:52,032
Babies grow up.
You keep that thing, one day,
we'll turn our backs--

16
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,452
It'll be picking us
out of its teeth.

17
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,039
- Things like that
eat things like us as snacks!

18
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,584
- So, what do we do?

19
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,878
Get rid of it!

20
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,676
What has gotten into you?

21
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,430
Plio, that thing is dangerous!

22
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,517
I'm sorry, little one.

23
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,812
- Okay, get rid of it.

24
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:27,067
- Allright. I will.

25
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,791
You'd better hurry up, Dad.
It looks hungry.

26
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,195
Here.

27
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,323
- It's okay.

28
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,119
- We'll teach him to hate meat.
- Hmph.

29
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,957
- Watch his head.

30
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,460
I-I mean, watch it,
he could bite.

31
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,635
This monster's
got no teeth.

32
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,680
What's he gonna do?
Gum us to death?

33
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,892
Zini, come on.
Look at that sweet little face.

34
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:47,188
Does that look
like a monster toyou?

35
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,271
- Let me out! Let me out!

36
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,777
Hair ball.

37
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,863
- That was great! Get him!

38
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,241
Oh, no! Attacking lemurs!
Suri, please!

39
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:45,038
I can't take it! There
are too many of you! Come on!
Pick on someone your own size!

40
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:49,000
- Help!

41
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,714
Oh, no--

42
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:01,388
Aladar,
you're not dead.

43
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,474
- No!

44
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,644
All right, guys, break it up.
Remember the courtship?

45
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:12,399
- You gonna miss
seeing all that smooching.
-  Oh, Mom.

46
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:18,279
- That's okay, Plio.
We can smooch right here.

47
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:22,659
- It's a shame you don't like kids.
- Nasty little vermin.

48
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,495
Ha-ha. Go find Zini.

49
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,541
He's rehearsing pickup lines.
Let's hope he's found
some new material.

50
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:34,170
Hey, sweetie, if you'll be my bride,
I'll groom ya.

51
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:38,008
That is good.
Oh, that's good.

52
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,720
Girls, I'm known
as the "professor of love",

53
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,556
and school's in session.

54
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,893
- Yeah, I still got it. 
- I hope it's not contagious.

55
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,939
- I'm a raging epidemic of romance.
- Come on, hot stuff.

56
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:56,192
Let's get goin'. You don't wanna miss
Yar's annual pep talk.

57
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,612
Oh, goody. I can't
wait to hear the mating advice
of an old monkey.

58
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:03,283
Hey-Hey-Hey, I heard
that in his day, that old monkey
was quite a swinger.

59
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,702
- You talkin' about Yar?
- Yeah, to hear him tell it,

60
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,704
he put the "prime" in "primate".

61
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,748
Really?

62
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:14,544
Okay, boys, gather 'round.
Listen and learn from the master.

63
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:19,591
Now, girls, don't jump into
the trees after the first boy
with a cute back flip.

64
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,010
It's more fun
if you keep them guessing.

65
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,347
And if a cute back flip
doesn't work, guess.

66
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:30,018
You're never going to forget this day,
so make it one to remember.

67
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,689
But if you mess up, don't worry.
They'll never remember.

68
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,984
Come on, guys!
We don't wanna let 'em down!

69
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:42,072
- Go on, now. Chest up! Chin up!
-  Whoo!

70
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,911
- Make 'em look good, son.
- Come on, Yar.

71
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,498
- My charm and your brains? No problem.

72
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,380
Ha-ha!

73
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,758
- Hey, girls,
look what just pulled into town.
-  Hey, ladies!

74
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,886
- Your buffet table of love.

75
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,138
- Right here!Right here!
- Hey, beautiful!

76
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:10,558
Hey, free samples!
Get me while I'm hot!

77
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,853
Whoa!

78
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,106
Zini.

79
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,278
- Whoo! Wah-hoo!
-  Whoo!

80
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:31,621
- Yah-hoo!

81
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,556
- You're missin'
all the action, pal. Come on.

82
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,726
Hey, haven't you heard?
I am the action!

83
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,310
Ah, don't worry, Zini.
You always have next year.

84
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,397
Hey, I'm lucky to be rid of them.
With the ladies,

85
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,483
- before you know it,
they all wanna move to a bigger tree.
- Hmm.

86
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:29,030
Oh, well. Poor Zini.
The clan still has one bachelor.

87
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,618
No, we have two.

88
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,128
Well, it's never
really been his best event.

89
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,965
He's got a tougher hide than mine.
- Oh, Aladar,

90
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,552
if only there was someone
on the island for you.

91
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,346
Well, you know, who looks like you,
but prettier.

92
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:58,435
Come on, Plio.
What more could I want?

93
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,360
Whoa!

94
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,253
- What are they?
- I don't know.

95
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,412
Dad?

96
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,415
Something's wrong.

97
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,795
Aladar, where's Suri?

98
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:10,423
- She's up in the tree.

99
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,169
Come on! Go! Go!
Come on!

100
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,213
-Mom!
- Suri!

101
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,675
- Mom! Mom!
- Suri!

102
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,511
- Mom!
-  Suri, where are you?

103
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,476
Run, Aladar!
Run! Run!

104
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,990
- Yar, come on!

105
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:21,453
- Zini, jump! Jump!
-  Zini, jump!

106
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,873
- Hold on!

107
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:27,435
Plio! Yar! Where are you?

108
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,231
Aladar, over here!

109
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,614
I feel bad. I feel bad.

110
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:06,159
Oh, Suri.
Easy, easy.

111
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,205
They're all gone.

112
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:15,877
- Shh, shh. I'm here.

113
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,173
Come on.
We can't stay here.

114
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:26,197
Now, now, Suri.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

115
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:29,451
- Look!
- Whoa!

116
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:32,037
- Did you see that?
-  What?
-  I did.

117
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,624
-  Me too!
-  Where did it go?
- I don't know. Let's go see.

118
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,003
- Leave it alone. Hey!
-  Shh, Dad.

119
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,505
-  It's scaring Suri.
-  No, it's not.

120
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,342
Everyone just be quiet.

121
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:56,871
-  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-  Yar, grab on!

122
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,542
-  I can't reach!

123
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:12,345
-  Aladar, they're stopping!

124
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:15,557
- Huh?

125
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:19,436
Stay out of my way!

126
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,691
You heard Kron.
Move it!

127
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,753
- Watch it.

128
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:00,435
-  Zini, get your head down.

129
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:34,260
Walkin' backwards, huh?
Well, let me know if that
gets you there any faster.

130
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:38,640
Keep those little legs movin;
Url, or you'll get left behind.

131
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:52,278
Look at all the Aladars.

132
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:56,574
- If you're even thinking
of joining them--

133
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,411
- Hang on! Hang on!

134
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:28,815
-Kron,

135
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,192
there is a more protected spot
further down the--

136
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:35,864
- We'll rest here for the night.
Go ahead, Bruton.

137
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:53,006
Oh, Eema, I wish we were
at your nesting grounds now.

138
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:56,176
All this pushing
and shoving about,

139
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,428
just for a place to sleep.

140
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:01,139
I'm not used
to this kind of behavior.

141
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:05,769
- Baylene, you got big feet.
Just give 'em a kick. Git!

142
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,730
Ooh, I couldn't possibly.

143
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:11,066
Shoo, shoo.

144
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:15,236
Will you come on, Baylene?
You wanna get
to the nesting grounds alive?

145
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,447
- Show some backbone.
- Hey, there.

146
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,658
- Oh, sorry about that.

147
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,620
Uh, it'sjust,
we overheard you talking,
and, um--

148
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,335
Well, my word.
Look at Uri.

149
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,338
- He doesn't normally
warm up to strangers so fast.

150
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:41,554
- What an unfortunate blemish.
- Good mud bath'd clear those right up.

151
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,808
- Excuse me?

152
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:48,436
Um, he's my grandfather, 
couple of times removed.

153
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,022
Try a couple of species removed.

154
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:56,695
Uh, my name's Aladar.
This is my family.
We're all that's left.

155
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,489
Oh, my dear.
I'm so sorry.

156
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:04,869
Baylene's the last ofher kind.
Finding stragglers like her
all along the way.

157
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:08,748
I heard you say something
about nesting grounds?

158
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:12,919
It is the most beautiful place
there is, child.

159
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:15,422
It's where the herd goes
to have their babies.

160
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:19,426
Will we find anybody
that looks like us there?

161
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:23,638
Oh, the last few days,
I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes.

162
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:26,099
Who knows
what we'll find.

163
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:29,561
The hard job now
is just getting there.

164
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:32,480
- And we're being driven unmercifully.
- By who?

165
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:35,984
Kron, the herd's head honcho.

166
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,404
We can hardly keep up.
An older woman like myself--

167
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:41,865
It's-- Well,
it's positively indecent.

168
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,534
- Then tell him.
What's the worst he can do?

169
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,786
Oh!

170
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:51,332
- Hey!

171
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,461
What's his problem?

172
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:58,506
- That's him, honey. Kron.
- Huh.

173
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,509
- Uh, excuse me!
Kron, you got a second?

174
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:05,847
- Get lost, kid.
- Hmm. Relax, Bruton.

175
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:13,646
- Who are you?
- Uh, Aladar.

176
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:16,733
Why aren't you uphill
with the--

177
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,986
uh, young bloods?

178
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,199
- Well, I was back here
talking to these guys.

179
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,077
- I guess they--
They're having a hard time keeping up.

180
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,872
- So, you know, maybe you
could slow it down a bit?

181
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:36,044
Hmm. Let the weak set the pace.
Now, there's an idea.

182
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:40,340
Better let me do the thinking
from now on, Aladar.

183
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:43,593
- Hey, they need help back here.
- Hmm.

184
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:47,055
Watch yourself, boy.

185
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,101
Don't worry. That's how my brother
treats newcomers,

186
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:54,187
no matter how charming
they are.

187
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,232
You sure know how to catch a girl's eye,
there, stud.

188
00:30:57,315 --> 00:31:01,695
I wouldn't be catchin' nobody's eye
if I was you, especially Neera's.

189
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,615
You just keep your head down,
and you mind what Kron tells you.

190
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:09,536
Since when do we take orders
from the likes of him?

191
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:13,373
Kron has swatted flies
bigger than you, pops.

192
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:16,668
I could hold that monster's brain
in the palm of my--

193
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:20,130
No, Yar, she's right.
Better to keep our heads down
with this bunch...

194
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:23,341
- than get 'em
bitten off by those things.

195
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:28,138
Well, you just consider yourself lucky
that's all that's following us.

196
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:56,583
- Hey, wake up.

197
00:31:56,666 --> 00:32:00,420
- Enough with the beauty sleep.
You're ravishing already.

198
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:03,465
Hey! Hello!
Anybody in there?

199
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,385
Zini, what are you doing?

200
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:10,305
I believe you left a wake-up call
for the dawn of time.

201
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,807
- Come on! Move it!
- What's the hurry?

202
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:16,478
Something's up.
The herd's gathering without us.
Let's check it out.

203
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,398
Rise and shine!
Kron says everybody goes.

204
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:23,318
- Come on. Get up. On your feet.

205
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,029
Huh. The charm
never stops around here.

206
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:28,406
You say something?

207
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:31,159
Uh, no-- no, sir.

208
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,662
Unless you got a death wish,

209
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:40,168
you and that little parasite
better get moving!

210
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:43,004
Sheesh, is that guy ugly or what?

211
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:47,676
Hey, hey, hey,
there's your girlfriend.

212
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:55,141
- What are you talkin' about?
- You know what
I'm talkin' about: Neera.

213
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:59,729
Scaly skin. Yellow eyes. Big ankles.

214
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:02,857
Yeah, I made a real impression
on her.

215
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:06,444
What you need is a little help
from the love monkey.

216
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:10,573
- "The love monkey"?
- Ow, baby!

217
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:15,870
Ow!

218
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,998
- That, children,

219
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:24,254
- is what's known as a "jerkasaurus".

220
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:28,133
- And with that, the ice is broken.

221
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:40,520
We've got a lot of first-timers here.
Make sure they get it.

222
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:43,857
We stop for nothing
and no one.

223
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,904
If this is
your first crossing, listen up.

224
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,533
- There is no water
till we reach the other side.

225
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:58,621
And you'd better keep up,
'cause if a predator catches you,
you're on your own. Move out!

226
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:10,216
-  Oh, my goodness.

227
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:13,845
- It looks like a very long walk.
-And hot.

228
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,931
If you smell somethin' sizzlin',
it could be me.

229
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:50,715
We're moving too slow.

230
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:54,302
I'll pick up the pace.

231
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,312
Hey, old girl,
you're wandering off a bit.

232
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:09,317
That's all I need:
a monkey on my back.

233
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,650
- On your feet, Eema.

234
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:53,486
We can't let those things
eat you.

235
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:56,281
They're out there
waiting.

236
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:47,332
- The lake!
-  We made it?

237
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:49,959
It's just over that--
that hill, baby.

238
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:52,045
Oh, thank goodness.

239
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,881
Come on, Eema.
Water. Remember water?

240
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:58,593
Oh, it's time
to refresh my memory.

241
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:29,541
I'm just gonna walk
right into that lake...

242
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:33,586
- until the water's
up tomy eyeballs...

243
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:38,091
and soak it all in.

244
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:51,980
Maybe the rains
collected somewhere else.

245
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:56,526
What do you want us to do?

246
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:59,988
Take a scout
and check the entire perimeter.

247
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:09,039
- Enough! You have to be strong now.

248
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,168
The nesting grounds
are only a few days away. Keep moving!

249
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:18,465
- Kron, we've never gone
this long without water.

250
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:21,384
If we keep going like this,
we'll lose half the herd.

251
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:26,056
Then we save the half
that deserves to live.

252
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:36,983
What? They're moving already?
Oh-Ho, we'll never keep up.

253
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,403
There was water here,
always water here before.

254
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:48,203
We always had water, always.

255
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:52,874
- And-- And plenty of mud. 
- Oh, Eema, please.

256
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:56,711
The herd won't wait.
We must carry on.

257
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:02,050
- You gotta get up.

258
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:08,807
- There was water everywhere.
- There is no water, dear.

259
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:29,160
- Baylene, don't move.
- What is it?

260
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,371
What's wrong?

261
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:36,543
- Doyou hear that?
- I sure do. Lift your foot, Baylene.

262
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,173
Ooh!

263
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:44,926
- Now press down.

264
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,600
I always did like big girls!

265
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:55,979
- Water!
- Oh, my goodness!

266
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:04,654
- Water! Come on!
- He found water.

267
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:10,910
That's it, Eema.
Come drink.

268
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:30,472
Kron, look.
All we had to do is dig, and--

269
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:33,933
Good. Now, get out of the way.

270
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:49,157
Wait! Wait!
There's enough for everyone!

271
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,785
Ah!

272
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:02,629
- Oh.
- Eema!

273
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:11,221
That's it. Keep pushing and shoving.
That's very helpful.

274
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:25,235
Bruton, we've been walking in circles.
There's no water here.

275
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:28,530
- I think we should get back.
- Shh. Keep it down.

276
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,838
- Let's get out of here.

277
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:15,118
Now, you come out on three.

278
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:18,830
One, two, three!

279
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:24,461
Come on. Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you.

280
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:26,796
Hey, hey.
What's going on?

281
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,799
The little Aladars haven't
had anything to drink.

282
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:31,926
I think they're scared of me.

283
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:34,471
Who wouldn't be?
You are pretty scary.

284
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:37,682
-  Come on over, guys.

285
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:43,605
- Take it easy. Don't worry.
She's just a hair ball.
- And proud of it.

286
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:46,274
Come on. He's gonna
find you some water.

287
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,583
Here. Now, you just
take a foot and press.

288
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,254
- Whoa.

289
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,924
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on. Come on. Knock it off.

290
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:14,260
Let's work together here, huh?
A little teamwork. Ready?

291
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:18,515
One, two, three. Press!

292
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:25,188
Good job, Suri.

293
00:43:25,313 --> 00:43:30,151
- So, where are your parents, anyway?
-A lot of us are on our own now.

294
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:34,364
You like kids, I see.

295
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:37,951
- Well, the skinny ones
can be a little chewy.

296
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:42,414
I'm Aladar...
the "jerkasaurus".

297
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:45,625
Ohh. Sorry about that.

298
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,711
You're probably right.

299
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:51,047
-  Dad, wake up.
-  Huh?

300
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:53,758
Why did you
help that old one?

301
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:56,219
What else could we do?
Leave her behind?

302
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,142
Oh. You mean, you actually--

303
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:04,144
Well, that happens all the time.

304
00:44:04,227 --> 00:44:06,855
- You don't survive
if you're not--
- Strong enough.

305
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,190
Well... yeah.

306
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:11,901
Is that you talking,
or your brother?

307
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:15,905
Everything's so different.

308
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:19,451
I-I don't know
what to think anymore.

309
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:22,787
Look, Neera--
we watch out for each other,

310
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:25,790
we all stand a chance of getting
to your nesting grounds.

311
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:29,002
- You sound so sure.
- I'm not,

312
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:31,504
but it's all I know.

313
00:44:33,214 --> 00:44:35,800
So, um-- Oh, water.

314
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:38,428
I'll, uh,
get you some water.

315
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:41,431
- Can I try it?
- Sure. Just press.

316
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:48,480
- Hmm.
-  Oops.

317
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:51,399
- Sorry.
- No. You-- You first.

318
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:54,903
One down... and,

319
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:57,697
well, one down.

320
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:22,180
Kron!

321
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:25,642
- Carnotaurs!
- What? They never come this far north.

322
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:29,104
The fireball must've driven them out.

323
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:37,278
You led them right to us!
Maybe you can feed them
with your hide!

324
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,906
Move the herd out,
double-time!

325
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:53,878
- What's happening?
- My brother's moving the herd.

326
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,217
Kron, what's going on?

327
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,220
Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving,
they'll catch up to us.

328
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:05,557
But the others in the back--
They'll never make it.

329
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,434
They'll
slow down the predators.

330
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:11,438
You can't sacrifiice them
like this!

331
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:15,066
- Hold it! That could be
you back there! Or you!

332
00:46:18,486 --> 00:46:21,156
If you ever interfere again,

333
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:23,616
I'll kill you.

334
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:30,790
Stay away from him!

335
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,084
Ooh.

336
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:37,130
Aladar, no.
You just--just go. I'll be okay.

337
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:46,264
Let's go! Let's go!
Carnotaurs!

338
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:48,224
- Carno-what?
-Carnotaur.

339
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,269
A mouthful of teeth
with a bad attitude. Let's go.

340
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:55,148
Come on, you guys! Get on! Get on!
We're gonna get left behind.

341
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,653
Let's go! Hurry up!
We're losing them!

342
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:03,573
Aladar, slow down.

343
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:55,542
Oh, joy. Blisters.

344
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:58,378
I've got blisters
on my blisters.

345
00:47:58,503 --> 00:48:02,048
- You don't wanna know
where I got blisters.

346
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:05,176
- What was that?
- It came from up ahead.

347
00:48:05,301 --> 00:48:08,722
- Okay,
what's the worst thing it could be?
- A carnotaur.

348
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:13,018
- What's the second-worst thing
it could be?
- Two carnotaurs! Oh!

349
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:15,228
- That's it. I'm gone.
-  Oh, my goodness!

350
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:18,189
Everybody, we don't know for sure.
It could be the herd.

351
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:21,276
- Let's check it out.
- Oh, my goodness.
Goodness gracious.

352
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:34,164
Oh, it's Bruton.

353
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:37,542
It appears we weren't
the only ones left behind.

354
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:54,559
- What happened?
- Carnotaurs. We should keep moving.

355
00:48:54,642 --> 00:48:58,855
- We can't just leave him here.
- We can if we move fast enough.

356
00:48:58,938 --> 00:49:03,443
Hey, you don't look so good.
Let me help you.

357
00:49:03,568 --> 00:49:08,948
Save your pity.
I just need some rest.
Now, get away from me.

358
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:11,993
- Suit yourself.

359
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:16,998
- Hmm?

360
00:49:33,014 --> 00:49:36,351
If you change your mind,
we'll be in those caves.

361
00:49:38,436 --> 00:49:40,730
Mm.

362
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:48,279
It's dark, but
at least it's dry.

363
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:52,158
- I like dry. It's the dark part
I'm having trouble with.

364
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:54,994
Ouch!
Ooh. Sorry, Url.

365
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:57,330
Sturdy little thing,
ain't he?

366
00:49:57,455 --> 00:50:01,751
- Ahem. We appear to have a visitor.

367
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:31,114
You coming in or what?

368
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:34,075
What is it with you?

369
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:37,037
At least I know enough
to get in out of the rain.

370
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,165
Now, come on.
On your feet.

371
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:06,149
- Uh, you can lie down
with us. It's warmer.

372
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,910
May I remind you
that he's one of them ?

373
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:20,372
Well, looks like
he's one of us now.

374
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:32,342
Ahh. Who booked
this trip, anyway?

375
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:34,844
Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds
soon enough.

376
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:38,723
Well, when I get there,
I'm gonna give Kron a piece of my mind.

377
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:41,893
- You tell him, Eema.

378
00:51:48,858 --> 00:51:52,570
If I could sleep that deep,
I'd be in paradise.

379
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:56,991
If you could
sleep that deep, honey, you'd be dead.

380
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:03,790
This plant grew
on our island.

381
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,711
It will make you feel better.

382
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:11,881
Ahh.

383
00:52:16,928 --> 00:52:22,809
Why is he doing this?
Pushing them on with false hope?

384
00:52:22,934 --> 00:52:25,937
It's hope that's
gotten us this far.

385
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:28,857
But why doesn't he let them
accept their fate?

386
00:52:30,066 --> 00:52:32,318
I've accepted mine.

387
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:36,823
- And what is your fate?
- To die here.

388
00:52:36,906 --> 00:52:39,451
It's the way things are.

389
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:41,995
Only if you give up,
Bruton.

390
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:45,665
It's your choice,
not your fate.

391
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:52,172
Well, the plant will help.

392
00:53:36,257 --> 00:53:38,802
-Shh.

393
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:40,970
Carnotaurs.

394
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:48,895
- What do we do?
- Wake the others.

395
00:54:08,998 --> 00:54:11,543
Oh.

396
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:15,088
- Ooh.

397
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:42,032
-  Go! Go!

398
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:44,200
Hurry!

399
00:54:46,661 --> 00:54:48,621
Move it, Eema!

400
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:52,125
Oh!

401
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,961
-  Aladar!

402
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:57,630
Aladar! Oh, no!

403
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,891
- I'll hold them off!.
You help the others!

404
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,094
Bruton!

405
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:57,816
Bruton! No!

406
00:56:10,578 --> 00:56:13,623
Bruton!

407
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,643
You did what you could.

408
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:40,085
It's okay, little ones.

409
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:42,796
We're going to make it.

410
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,823
Okay, okay.
Let's do it again. Let's do it again.

411
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:13,159
- Uh, I spy with my little eye--
- A rock.

412
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:16,413
You got it again!
Ooh! You are good!

413
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:20,667
Well, I'll tell you what I spy.
A dead end.

414
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:31,302
- What do we do now?
- I guess we just go back.

415
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:34,097
Hold on a moment.

416
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,850
- Zini, what is it?

417
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:40,979
- Do you smell that?
-  Yeah.

418
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:56,619
Get a load of that.
-  Good show.

419
00:58:56,703 --> 00:58:59,914
Everybody stand back.
We're outta here!

420
00:59:08,965 --> 00:59:11,885
Aladar, look out!

421
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:21,311
No!

422
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:59,099
Aladar, we'll go back.

423
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,935
Back to what?
It's gone.

424
01:00:03,144 --> 01:00:07,065
We're not meant
to survive.

425
01:00:07,148 --> 01:00:10,819
Oh, yes, we were.
We're here, aren't we?

426
01:00:10,944 --> 01:00:14,364
And how dare you
waste that good fortune
by simply giving up?

427
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:18,076
Shame on you.
Shame on you! Shame on you!

428
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:20,704
The worst of it is,

429
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:23,707
you allowed an old fool like me
to believe I was needed--

430
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:28,003
that I still had a purpose--
and do you know what?

431
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:31,840
You were right.
And I'm going to go on believing it.

432
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:35,760
And I, for one,
am not willing to die here.

433
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:28,146
Oh, dear.

434
01:01:44,245 --> 01:01:46,706
The nesting grounds.

435
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,459
It's-- It's untouched.

436
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:13,400
Our new home.

437
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:16,528
- And it comes with a pool!

438
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:20,323
- Yodelay-yodelay-
yodelay heehoo

439
01:02:24,202 --> 01:02:26,913
Cannonball!
Whoo-hoo-ha-ha!

440
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:30,834
Ha. Amateur.

441
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:34,212
Look out below!

442
01:02:49,185 --> 01:02:53,398
- Not bad. But I don't get it.
Where's the herd?

443
01:02:54,357 --> 01:02:57,569
- Not to mention Neera.

444
01:02:57,694 --> 01:03:00,113
They'll get here--

445
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:02,741
Mm. Soon enough.

446
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:07,454
Oh, no.

447
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:09,539
Eema?

448
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:15,462
- I spoke too soon.
- What is it?

449
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:19,007
That is the way
we used to get in here.

450
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:27,057
They'll never make it
over that.

451
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:31,770
Aladar, wait! Wait!
Kron'll eat you alive.

452
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:35,148
Let him try.

453
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:39,527
Mm. I hope Kron's
in a listening mood.

454
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:58,880
Stay here.

455
01:04:04,594 --> 01:04:07,263
We'll find a way
around it.

456
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:11,142
In the morning,
we'll climb it.

457
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,954
We have to keep trying.

458
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:18,084
Our survival, our future,
is over these rocks.

459
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:20,712
Now, let's go home!

460
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,224
You'll make it,
won't you, boys?

461
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:36,269
- No.
- Watch them. They're tough!

462
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:39,856
If they can do it,
so can you!

463
01:05:47,947 --> 01:05:50,575
- Kron!

464
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:54,371
Get the herd out of here!
A carnotaur is coming!

465
01:05:57,165 --> 01:06:00,043
- Keep moving!
-Stop!

466
01:06:00,168 --> 01:06:04,923
- I've been to the valley!
There's a safer way!

467
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:09,094
- Go on! Show 'em!
- Kron, listen to him.

468
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:13,306
- Look, we gotta go now!
- Go where, straight
to the carnotaurs?

469
01:06:13,431 --> 01:06:17,060
If we hurry, we can get around them!
You can't get over those rocks!

470
01:06:17,143 --> 01:06:20,105
There's a sheer drop
on the other side!

471
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:25,819
You're gonna kill the herd!
I know a way to the valley,
and everybody can make it!

472
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:28,488
- Now, follow me!

473
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:32,200
- Kron!

474
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:35,412
They're staying with me!

475
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:37,831
All right. Let's go!

476
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:36,181
Neera!

477
01:08:31,861 --> 01:08:36,783
He's led that monster
right to us! This way!

478
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:40,120
- No! Don't move!

479
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:44,290
If we scatter, he'll pick us off!.
Stand together!

480
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:10,085
Kron!

481
01:10:30,563 --> 01:10:33,316
- No. No.

482
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:51,936
Kron.

483
01:12:48,868 --> 01:12:50,829
Welcome home.

484
01:13:25,905 --> 01:13:29,993
Move over, everybody.
Bringing in babies is what I do best.

485
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:32,996
I'd say it's been a few years
since you've hatched an egg.

486
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:37,459
- You're right, so let me
practice on your head.

487
01:13:37,584 --> 01:13:42,005
Look! Somebody wants to meet you.

488
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:52,223
Ohh! Aren't you the sweetest
little small fry I ever did see?

489
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:55,310
Hey, little guy.
He looks just like me.

490
01:13:55,393 --> 01:13:59,439
Meet your dad.
He's not as crazy as he looks.

491
01:13:59,522 --> 01:14:02,525
-Ohh. Oh, happy day.

492
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:05,945
- Well done, little one.

493
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:10,116
Come here, you little rascal.
Let me get a good look at you.

494
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:16,790
Yep. You're your father's son,
all right.

495
01:14:16,873 --> 01:14:21,628
- Hey!
Look what I found! New neighbors!

496
01:14:21,711 --> 01:14:25,799
Any of you ladies up for a game
of "monkey in the middle"?

497
01:14:25,882 --> 01:14:29,302
- Easy, now! Easy! Hey!

498
01:15:18,518 --> 01:15:23,565
None of us really know what changes,
big or small, lie ahead.

499
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:27,610
One thing is certain--
Our journey's not over.

500
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:32,115
We can only hope
that in some small way...

501
01:15:32,198 --> 01:15:35,326
our time here
will be remembered.
