You're asking me my opinion?

What exactly have you been
telling people about me?

545
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,897
Only the truth, mademoiselle.

George was honest,
prosperous...

and trusted by his customers.

620
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:37,632
But George was not content.

621
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:39,634
He feIt there
should be more to life...

622
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,970
than dispensing liveroil.

ln the spring of 1927...

624

the Societe Pharmeceutique...

625
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:51,438

to Central America...

00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:53,606

the medicinalproperties...

George was the expedition's
most eager volunteer.

629
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:08,246
But his adventure
took a turn he did not expect.

630
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:15,462
One night, he was invited
to drink unrefined cacao...

631
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:17,130
with a pinch ofchili.

632
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:21,384
The very same drink

00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:23,887
used in theirsacred
ceremonies.

634
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:28,850
The Maya believed
cacao held the power...

635
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,394
to unlock hidden yearnings...

that George first saw Chitza.

Now, George had been raised
a good Catholic...

639
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:55,210
but in his romance
with Chitza...

640
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,504
he was willing
to slightly bend the rules...

641
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,547
ofChristian courtship.

642
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:04,761

tried to warn George about her.

heed their warning...

650

and fora while,
it seemed that he and Chitza...

651

togetherin France.

Well, but if Charly
has no soul...

in him breaking Lent.
