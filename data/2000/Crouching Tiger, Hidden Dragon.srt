1
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,066
Master Li is here!

2
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:09,194
-Master Li is here!
-Master Li is here!

3
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,169
Shu Lien!

4
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:30,466
Shu Lien! Li Mu Bai is here!

5
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:37,765
-Master Li.
-Hello.

6
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:41,059
-How's everything?
-Fine. Please come in.

7
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,616
-Li Mu Bai. It's been a long time.
-It has.

8
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:59,578
-How's business?
-Not bad. And how are you?

9
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:01,205
Fine.

10
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:08,045
Monk Zheng came by
from the Wudang Mountain.

11
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,756
He said you were practicing
deep meditation.

12
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:16,595
The mountain must be so peaceful.
I envy you.

13
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:19,848
My work keeps me so busy
I hardly get a minute's rest.

14
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:24,937
I broke it off.
I couldn't complete the training.

15
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:29,733
Why? You're a Wudang fighter.
Training is everything.

16
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:36,573
During my meditation training,
I came to a place of deep silence.

17
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:39,743
I was surrounded by light.

18
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:43,413
Time and space disappeared.

19
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:48,877
I felt I had come to a place
my master had never told me about.

20
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:54,508
-You were enlightened.
-Far from it.

21
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:58,470
I didn't feel the bliss
one should feel when enlightened.

22
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:02,933
Instead, I was surrounded
by an endless sorrow.

23
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:07,104
It was more than I could take.

24
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:11,024
I couldn't go on. I failed.

25
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,821
There was something pulling me
back into the world.

26
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,907
What was it?

27
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,329
Something I can't seem to let go of.

28
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,544
I see you're preparing to leave.

29
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:35,090
We're making a delivery to Beijing.

30
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,803
Perhaps I could ask you
to deliver something to Sir Te for me.

31
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:48,270
The Green Destiny Sword?
You're giving it to Sir Te?

32
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:51,899
I am. He has always been
our greatest protector.

33
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,943
I don't understand.
How can you part with it?

34
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:57,404
It's been with you a long time.

35
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:01,158
Too many men have died at its edge.

36
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,372
It may look pure

37
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,250
but only because blood
washes easily from its blade.

38
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:14,212
You use it for good cause,
making you worthy of it.

39
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:19,009
It's time for me to leave it behind.

40
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:22,512
So what will you do then?

41
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,601
Come with me to Beijing.

42
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:30,938
You can give the sword to Sir Te in person.

43
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:33,690
It'll be just like old times.

44
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:38,737
I need to visit my master's grave.

45
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:43,241
It's been many years since
he was murdered by Jade Fox.

46
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:48,080
I have yet to avenge his death,
and yet I'm thinking of quitting.

47
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:51,124
I must pray for his forgiveness.

48
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:56,088
Catch up with me when you have finished.

49
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,757
I will wait for you if you come.

50
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,176
Maybe.

51
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,436
-Okay, you may pass.
-Thanks.

52
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:13,397
Let's go into the city. We can rest
after we unload the shipment.

53
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:27,244
Thank God everything is safe.
Much obliged, Miss Yu.

54
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:30,622
Just doing my job.

55
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:34,626
Sun Security has been the best
since your father started it.

56
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:39,589
You're a credit to your father's memory.

57
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:43,093
-Thank you.
-It's the truth.

58
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:21,256
This is Li's personal sword.

59
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,927
A great hero is worthy of a great weapon.

60
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:30,640
He is the only one in the world
worthy of it.

61
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,061
It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.

62
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,148
The sword has brought Li Mu Bai
as much trouble as glory.

63
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:41,109
Li wants to leave these troubles behind.

64
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,362
Take the sword and help him
leave his old way of life.

65
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:47,949
I see. All right.
I'll act as the sword's custodian.

66
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:53,038
Ninth Level Counsel, Chief Yu has arrived.

67
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,706
I must change.

68
00:06:55,333 --> 00:07:00,295
Thank you. You've always been
a great friend to Li and me.

69
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,964
No hurry to leave. Please feel at home.

70
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,926
You'll stay the night as my guest.

71
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,221
Now, Shu Lien,

72
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:13,225
tell me something,
and forgive me for prying.

73
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,770
But your father was like a brother to me

74
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:20,023
and I think of you as my own daughter.

75
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,484
Please, Sir Te, what is it?

76
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:27,781
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword
and his warrior days,

77
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,368
maybe he's hinting something to you.

78
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,871
-I don't know.
-Don't be coy.

79
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:38,083
I've known all along about
your feelings for each other.

80
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,585
Neither of you have been brave enough

81
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,339
to reveal your feelings to each other.

82
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,677
So many years went wasted.

83
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,888
Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

84
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:54,432
Maybe it isn't what you've thought.

85
00:07:56,435 --> 00:08:02,232
When it comes to emotions,
even great heroes can be idiots.

86
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:07,612
If Li Mu Bai doesn't talk straight
next time you see him,

87
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,575
let me know, and I'll give him an earful!

88
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,377
You will stay in this room.

89
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,384
You?

90
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:38,143
I am your guest here today.

91
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,981
This is Sir Te's study. You are here to...

92
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:47,277
It's so crowded out there.
I was looking for a quiet place.

93
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,240
I'm Sir Te's head servant, De Lu.
This is another of our guests.

94
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:07,881
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal.

95
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:11,885
It's the handle that's heavy.
And that blade is no ordinary metal.

96
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:15,305
Still, the sword is the lightest
of all weapons.

97
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,225
You find it heavy because
you're not used to handling them.

98
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:20,727
No, I've had a lot
of experience with weapons.

99
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,063
My father has security guards
living with us.

100
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,398
They let me play with their weapons.

101
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,944
This scabbard is so beautiful.

102
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,322
Beautiful and yet dangerous.

103
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:36,159
Once you've seen it tainted with blood,
you'll think otherwise.

104
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,621
It's 400 years old.

105
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:41,915
It's exquisite.

106
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,377
You said this sword belongs to...

107
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,963
My friend Li Mu Bai.

108
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:50,423
He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.

109
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:53,009
Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior?

110
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:57,222
I've heard so much about him.
Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?

111
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,058
It's a long story.

112
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:06,147
-You must be a sword fighter, too.
-Yes, but I prefer the machete.

113
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:10,318
This sword fits Li Mu Bai perfectly.

114
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,571
Really.

115
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,743
It must be exciting to be a fighter.

116
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,747
Fighters have rules, too.
Friendship, trust, integrity.

117
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,958
Always keep your promise.

118
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,836
Without rules, we wouldn't survive long.

119
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:30,964
I've read all about people like you.

120
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,967
Roaming wild,
beating up anyone who gets in your way!

121
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,012
Writers have to write like that
to sell books.

122
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,931
You're just like the characters
in the stories.

123
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:43,893
Sure, no place to bathe for days,
sleeping on flea-infested beds.

124
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,771
They tell you all about that in those books?

125
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,773
You know what I mean.

126
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:53,194
I'm getting married soon,
but I haven't lived the life I want.

127
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,574
I've heard of your engagement.
Congratulations.

128
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,998
It's the most important step
in a woman's life, isn't it?

129
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:10,003
-You are not married, are you?
-What do you think?

130
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:13,715
No. You couldn't roam around
freely if you were.

131
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,676
I admit you're probably right.

132
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,877
Chief Yu, take a look.

133
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:07,018
2 feet 9 inches long, 1.1 inch wide.

134
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:10,480
The handle is 1 inch long, 2.6 inches wide,

135
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:14,567
0.7 inch thick, each side is 1.5 inches.

136
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:17,195
With seven rubies missing from the hilt.

137
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,908
You can tell from the design that
it was made during the Qin Wu era.

138
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,120
Engraved with a technique lost
during the Han Dynasty.

139
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:28,331
Your knowledge is remarkable.

140
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,252
A sword by itself rules nothing.

141
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,463
It comes alive only through
skilful manipulation.

142
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,050
I see your point. Please continue, Sir Te.

143
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:42,011
The inner city in Beijing is not a problem.

144
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:46,224
With royalty and officials everywhere

145
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:51,020
the Royal Guard keep security tight.

146
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:53,773
But the outer city is hard to govern.

147
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:57,110
It's full of complex characters.

148
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:01,197
Proceed with caution
in your quest for law and order.

149
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:03,658
Don't depend only on the court.

150
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,703
Keep some contacts
in the Jiang Hu underworld.

151
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,581
It can ensure your position.

152
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:17,672
Be strong yet supple.
This is the way to rule.

153
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,369
Governess.

154
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,164
Let me do it.

155
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,338
-Please sit.
-I've made a pair of silk pajamas.

156
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,299
-Want to change into them?
-Leave them there.

157
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,724
I heard you met Yu Shu Lien today.

158
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,143
You know her?

159
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:17,190
Your mother would not want you
consorting with her kind.

160
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,570
I'll socialize with whomever I please.

161
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,573
Don't invite danger
into your father's house.

162
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,829
-I'm tired now!
-Go to bed then.

163
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,920
You've grown up
and will get married soon.

164
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,216
God knows what the future will bring.

165
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,010
It'll be just the same.

166
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,596
Enough, I'm tired.

167
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:56,604
It's autumn now.
I'll shut the windows for you.

168
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:25,383
Chilly, eh?

169
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,671
Thief!

170
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:29,322
Someone help! Catch the thief!

171
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,240
He's on the rooftop!

172
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:36,663
The sword's been stolen! Someone help!

173
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,957
He's on the roof! Stop, thief!

174
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,527
Catch him!

175
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,697
Avenge my mother!

176
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:16,035
What are you standing here for?
Go get him!

177
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:21,249
Return the sword, and I'll let you go.

178
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:29,048
You've been trained at Wudang?

179
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,722
We are street performers. You're wrong.

180
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:38,516
-We're just practicing the stunts.
-Let's go.

181
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:42,186
Practicing? Who are you trying to fool?

182
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,522
Where did they go?

183
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,744
Chief Yu's house.

184
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,347
Get down here!

185
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,990
Give me the sword.

186
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,358
Sir Te awaits you in the great hall.

187
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,444
I didn't get the sword back.

188
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:22,281
But I'm sure the thief's connected
to the Yus.

189
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,075
-How dare you!
-But I saw...

190
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,952
Enough! Get out!

191
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,882
Has Chief Yu ever seen the sword?

192
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,970
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

193
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,556
But the sword is somewhere
in his compound.

194
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:55,356
Then someone's out to frame him.

195
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,901
We should get word
to Li Mu Bai about this.

196
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,533
Watch your step.

197
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,038
-What is it?
-Someone's put fliers up.

198
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,546
Let me see.

199
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:29,265
Someone's after Jade Fox.
Preposterous, looking for her here!

200
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:49,785
-Best spear fighting in the world!
-The Yang School of Spear Fighting!

201
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:08,929
-Where did they go?
-I really don't know.

202
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,309
I saw them couple of days ago.
Probably gone by now.

203
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:07,446
Miss, there's a Miss Yu here
asking to see you.

204
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,449
-Our Lady is busy right now.
-I will tell her then.

205
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,034
Show her in.

206
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:14,829
Yes.

207
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:22,211
This spells trouble.

208
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,798
I have a guest now.

209
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,182
This way please, Miss Yu.

210
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,482
-I've missed you!
-Missed me? How so?

211
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,151
I have nothing to do.

212
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:54,160
You're practicing calligraphy.

213
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,414
I'll write your name. Just for fun.

214
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:27,985
I never noticed that my name
looks like the word for sword.

215
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:31,864
You write gracefully.
Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.

216
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,950
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.

217
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:38,245
Please.

218
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:45,628
Thank you for seeing me.
I hear your wedding day is near.

219
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,130
You must be overwhelmed
with the preparations.

220
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:51,717
I'm hardly doing a thing.
The less I think of it, the better.

221
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:56,931
My parents are arranging everything,
including the groom.

222
00:25:57,307 --> 00:26:01,310
Mother says the Gous
are a very powerful family.

223
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:05,481
My marrying into this family
will give my dad's career a big boost.

224
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,235
It's a great fortune to marry
into such a noble family.

225
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:14,281
Is it? Actually,
I like the great heroes in the books

226
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,951
just like you and Li Mu Bai.

227
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,495
Marriage is a good thing.

228
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:22,081
If only I could be free to live my own life,

229
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:25,834
to choose who I love
and love him in my own way.

230
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,088
That's real happiness.

231
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:34,468
-Think so? Let me tell you a story.
-About you and Li Mu Bai?

232
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:38,597
Yes. I was once engaged
to be married when I was young.

233
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,810
-Really?
-His name was Meng Si Zhao.

234
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:46,021
He was a brother-by-oath to Li Mu Bai.

235
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,691
One day,
while defending Li Mu Bai in battle

236
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:52,027
he was killed by another man's sword.

237
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,532
After Meng's sacrifice,
Li and I went through a lot together.

238
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,659
Our feelings for each other grew stronger.

239
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:02,913
But we decided to honor
my engagement to Meng.

240
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:05,958
The freedom you talk about,
I too desire it,

241
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,210
but I've never tasted it.

242
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:11,046
It's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

243
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:14,550
Too bad for Meng,
but that's just the way things turn out.

244
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,555
As a woman,
I still must abide by tradition

245
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:24,518
even if I'm not an aristocrat like you.

246
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:31,025
Don't distance us.
From now on, let's be sisters.

247
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:37,364
All right. As a sister,
I hope you find real happiness.

248
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:16,278
Miles and miles of nothing.

249
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,075
Can't your father get an appointment
closer to civilization?

250
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,951
This place!

251
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,623
Jen, are you listening to me?

252
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:57,820
Let's go!

253
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,971
-Who are you?
-Dad!

254
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,557
Hold it! I'm a friend!

255
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:33,230
I don't care about your sword.

256
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:37,693
-Why are you spying on the Yus?
-I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox.

257
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:42,781
I'm a police inspector
from the Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.

258
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:46,827
This Jade Fox is a master criminal.
I hear she infiltrated the Yus.

259
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:50,581
She must have come with them
when he transferred here.

260
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,667
But I cannot just go in and catch her there.

261
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,711
I have to lure her out.

262
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,838
-This Jade Fox is a woman?
-You bet.

263
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,132
Then leave her to me. Don't worry.

264
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,051
Thank you, but I doubt you can handle her.

265
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:07,639
My wife used to be quite a martial artist.
Jade Fox killed her.

266
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:12,394
It's both an official and a personal matter
to me.

267
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:17,191
-Meatballs are ready!
-I'm more than ready for them.

268
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:20,277
Wait, dad gets first dip!

269
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,072
Hey!

270
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,617
They are gone.

271
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:29,661
What does it say?

272
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,956
We'll settle this at midnight tonight
on Cemetery Hill.

273
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,584
Good! The Fox is out of her hole.

274
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:38,629
Please.

275
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,799
Shu Lien, look who's here.

276
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:52,267
Sir Te thinks it's not appropriate
to cast doubt on Chief Yu.

277
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,979
But there is something up
in the Yu household. I'm investigating.

278
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:57,606
What have you found?

279
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:12,621
Jade Fox? Impossible!

280
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,916
You'd always suspected
she'd fled out west.

281
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,293
She has the nerve to come to Beijing.

282
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:22,047
Is there any place safer than
under the nose of Chief Yu?

283
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:27,386
I shall avenge my master's death after all.

284
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:31,265
But be careful, Li Mu Bai.

285
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,934
Sir Te requires discretion.

286
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:36,687
Official business is already
difficult to resolve,

287
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:40,357
it'd be a bigger mess
with your personal matters involved.

288
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:43,860
And I don't know,
this flyer may not be reliable.

289
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,946
It could be some sort of trap.

290
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:51,034
-Did you see who posted it?
-No.

291
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,537
It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.

292
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:57,833
Sir Te says the night of the theft
there was a brawl in front of Yu's.

293
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,918
Were you involved?

294
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:03,171
No, that was Bo, Sir Te's man.

295
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:05,007
Bo followed the thief to the Yus.

296
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:09,094
-Have you cross-examined him yet?
-Bo? No, not yet...

297
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:12,097
But you've had your men
stake out Yu's compound?

298
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:15,267
No, I'd already sent them back.

299
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:19,563
You can blame me for losing the sword

300
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:23,191
but trust me, I'll get it back soon
using my own methods.

301
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,653
That's not what I meant.

302
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,947
I don't care about the sword.

303
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:32,618
How can you say that?
Didn't you come back here for it?

304
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:36,413
I didn't know it was stolen until I got here.

305
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:39,666
Then, why did you come?

306
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,379
Well, we had talked...

307
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:51,386
Pardon my intrusion.
Master Li, your room is ready.

308
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,223
Thank you.

309
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,893
Please, lead the way.

310
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,281
This Fox doesn't care much for punctuality.

311
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,367
There's no sign of her.

312
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,251
Enough! Don't pretend any more.

313
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,883
Tsai! You old scoundrel!

314
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:32,886
You won't leave me alone. Payback time!

315
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,555
Yeah, old lady? Watch your mouth!

316
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:38,934
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.

317
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:42,104
If you resist, you're dead today.

318
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:45,190
Dad! Let me avenge my mother's death.

319
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,526
You'll end up like her, you little whore!

320
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,278
You old fox!

321
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:26,648
Dad!

322
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:59,514
You old fox, you ruined my life.
You won't get away with it.

323
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:16,239
Watch out for her acupressure!

324
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:23,830
Sue!

325
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,299
Tsai, you dog!

326
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,720
You even have hidden hands!

327
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:45,101
-Dad, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

328
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:48,563
Wudang should have gotten rid of you
long ago.

329
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:51,191
It's been a long time, Jade Fox!

330
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,611
You probably don't remember me.

331
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:57,572
But you remember my master.

332
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:02,702
You infiltrated my clan while I was away.

333
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:05,455
You poisoned my master
and stole the secret manual.

334
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,583
Now it's time for you to pay!

335
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,545
Your master underestimated us women.

336
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:14,673
He wouldn't teach me even after
he'd slept with me.

337
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:18,343
He deserved to die by a woman's hands!

338
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:01,595
You stole the top secrets
of Wudang's martial arts.

339
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,764
But you've mastered only
the basic moves in the past ten years.

340
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:07,475
For you to die under Wudang's
sword today

341
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:10,353
is no disgrace!

342
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,821
My disciple! Fight with me!
We'll kill them all!

343
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,073
-Fox has a disciple!
-I've got to get rid of Tsai!

344
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,000
Who are you?

345
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:37,297
Why is the Green Destiny Sword
in your possession?

346
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:40,967
-It's none of your business.
-My name is Li Mu Bai.

347
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:43,511
The Green Destiny Sword is mine.

348
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:56,232
Jade Fox can't be your master.

349
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,360
Where did you learn this "Xuan Piu" move?

350
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,362
Piece of cake.

351
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,619
Who is your master?

352
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:32,060
-Let's go.
-I'll kill them once and for all.

353
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,400
Let's go!

354
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:41,736
Dad!

355
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:44,072
Dad!

356
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:51,788
Dad!

357
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,510
This is Tsai?

358
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:11,057
My father. Police Inspector from Shaan.

359
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:16,771
Homicide must be reported to Chief Yu.

360
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,607
In addition, the victim is an officer.

361
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:23,236
You believe the killer is hiding out
in this compound?

362
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,948
I'd put my life on it, sir.

363
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:32,704
Come with me.

364
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,292
This needs to be resolved, and quickly.

365
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:41,129
I'll get into the Yu household and get her.

366
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:44,424
I'll ferret out this Fox
and her gang in no time.

367
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:49,137
Too dangerous. Yu is a court official
and in charge of security.

368
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:52,057
This could ruin his reputation and career.

369
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:54,476
It might also get Sir Te in trouble.

370
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,438
This calls for the utmost delicacy.

371
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:04,110
Sir Te, can you find some excuse
to invite Mrs. and Miss Yu over?

372
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:07,489
What do you have in mind?

373
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:12,077
The best way to trap a fox
is through her cubs.

374
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:20,585
Oh, my! Mrs. Te is spoiling us
with all these gifts.

375
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,922
She is being so considerate
to our daughter.

376
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:27,342
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough
to entertain you today.

377
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:30,136
I heard Sir Te has lost something.

378
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:33,223
And now Mrs. Te is not feeling well.

379
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:36,351
We know who stole the missing item.

380
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:42,524
If the thief returns it

381
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:46,194
I'm sure Sir Te will pursue
the matter no further.

382
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:47,904
That's good.

383
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:52,367
It's a real annoyance to have
servants who steal.

384
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:56,788
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
people sometimes make mistakes.

385
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:59,165
Some mistakes can ruin
not only themselves

386
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,584
but their entire family as well.

387
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:04,712
But don't be too lenient.

388
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:07,966
Sure. For example,
no mercy will be shown to the murderer

389
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,301
who just turned up in Beijing.

390
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:13,680
-A murderer?
-Yes,

391
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:17,559
the very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.

392
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:21,855
Last night she killed a policeman
who had tracked her for many years.

393
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:24,566
A female criminal! Now that's news!

394
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,902
You say she killed a policeman?

395
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:29,821
Yes, from the west.

396
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:33,575
He went undercover as a street performer,
and followed her here.

397
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:37,996
I'm no detective, but maybe
the murderer and thief are the same.

398
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:39,831
I doubt that.

399
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:44,419
This particular thief is very unusual.

400
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:47,589
And most likely smarter than a mere killer.

401
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:03,938
-Greetings, Sir Te.
-Hello, Mrs. Yu.

402
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:07,650
Let me introduce Li Mu Bai,
the renowned swordsman.

403
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:10,987
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Yu, Ms Yu.

404
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:13,615
Ms Yu is getting married soon.

405
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:17,952
Congratulations.

406
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:33,885
Why don't you come in?

407
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:38,473
-I'm standing guard.
-Come in. It's cold.

408
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:48,149
Come in. We don't have to fear
Jade Fox if we're together.

409
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:15,343
Isn't it a little late to be out?

410
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,139
You can give the sword to me.

411
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:22,684
I'll do as I please.

412
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,023
-Where's your master?
-None of your business!

413
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:57,051
Had enough flying?

414
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,265
You've got potential.

415
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:06,227
But you've misunderstood
Wudang's secret manual quite a bit.

416
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:11,733
You need a real master.

417
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:14,694
A master like you? It's a meaningless title.

418
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:16,404
You're right, it's all meaningless.

419
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:19,490
School is meaningless,
the secret manual is meaningless

420
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:22,577
even this sword.
It is just a state of mind.

421
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,998
Don't talk like a monk
just because you're in a temple. Just fight!

422
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:30,418
-Then tell me where Jade Fox is!
-Move!

423
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:47,393
True strength is light as a feather.

424
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,788
No assistance, no growth.

425
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:10,124
No reaction, no explanation.

426
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:12,794
No control, no desire.

427
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,797
Give yourself up and find yourself again.

428
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:19,342
Here's a lesson for you on life.

429
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:25,848
Go ahead.

430
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:29,894
Why should I? You need practice.

431
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:32,647
Learn to defeat movement with stillness.

432
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:35,775
That way you'll be worthy
of the Green Destiny.

433
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,321
Why do you want to teach me?

434
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:46,744
I've always wanted a disciple
worthy of the Wudang secrets.

435
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:51,749
Aren't you afraid that I'd kill you
once I mastered it?

436
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:55,086
That's a risk I'm willing to take
as your teacher.

437
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:59,090
Deep down you're good. Even Jade Fox
hasn't been able to corrupt you.

438
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:04,512
Wudang is a whorehouse!
Keep your lessons to yourself!

439
00:46:23,574 --> 00:46:26,492
You're home late, or should I say early?

440
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:33,458
Why are you still here?
You've killed a policeman!

441
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,919
You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

442
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:41,090
They wouldn't have tracked me here
if you hadn't stolen the sword.

443
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:45,052
You're not a little girl any more.
You thought this would be fun?

444
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:47,388
I'm in this, and you're in too.

445
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:49,557
Come with me, Jen.

446
00:46:49,683 --> 00:46:52,101
You don't want to waste your life

447
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:56,314
as the wife of some pompous bureaucrat.

448
00:46:56,857 --> 00:47:00,610
-As master and disciple, we will rule.
-I'll never live as a thief.

449
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:02,695
You're already the most wanted thief!

450
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,197
That was just for fun.
Why would I leave, and where?

451
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:10,828
Wherever we want.
We'd get rid of anyone in our way.

452
00:47:10,913 --> 00:47:13,039
-Even your father.
-Shut up!

453
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:16,626
That's the underworld fighter lifestyle.
Kill or be killed.

454
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:19,921
Exciting, isn't it?

455
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:28,596
-I've fulfilled my obligations to you.
-No, I have.

456
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:34,101
To have you as my disciple
is the thing in my life I'm most proud of.

457
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:45,446
You think you've been teaching me
all these years from the manual?

458
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:48,241
Thank goodness you're illiterate.

459
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:52,870
I studied the illustrations,
and you studied the words.

460
00:47:52,955 --> 00:47:55,039
You hid the details from me?

461
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:59,210
You wouldn't have understood it
even if you knew how to read.

462
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:03,047
You know you've gone
as far as you will go.

463
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,842
I hid my skills from you because
I was afraid you might get hurt.

464
00:48:09,346 --> 00:48:12,348
If it weren't for seeing you fight
with Li Mu Bai,

465
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:16,811
I'd still be ignorant
of all you've hidden from me.

466
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,898
Governess.

467
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:25,945
I started learning from you
in secret when I was 10.

468
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:29,574
You enchanted me with the dream
of the Jiang Hu underworld.

469
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:32,952
But once I realized I could exceed you,

470
00:48:33,704 --> 00:48:36,289
you can't imagine how frightened I was!

471
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:40,585
I had no one to guide me,
no one to follow,

472
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:44,297
no one to learn from.

473
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:50,261
There will be more
frightening things ahead.

474
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:06,045
Are you happy now that the sword is back?

475
00:50:07,506 --> 00:50:11,092
I admit, getting it back made me realize
how much I missed it.

476
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:15,304
But it's not your sword any more, is it?

477
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:17,264
You gave it to Sir Te.

478
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:23,688
True. But I must borrow it for one last job.

479
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:26,941
Jade Fox will die on its edge.

480
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:35,074
Did you know what you were hiding
when you covered for that girl?

481
00:50:35,826 --> 00:50:39,286
My job was to recover the sword
without embarrassing anyone.

482
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:44,667
I wasn't about to ruin her life,
or her father.

483
00:50:45,127 --> 00:50:46,627
You did your job well.

484
00:50:46,712 --> 00:50:50,214
The sword is back. But...this girl.

485
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,676
I saw her last night.

486
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:57,847
I knew you'd be suspicious.

487
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,974
She needs controlling.

488
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:02,810
She needs real direction and training.

489
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,689
She's an aristocrat's daughter,
she's not one of us.

490
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:12,319
It will all be over soon.
You'll kill Fox and she'll marry.

491
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:18,534
That's not her.
She should become a Wudang disciple.

492
00:51:19,995 --> 00:51:22,037
But Wudang doesn't accept women.

493
00:51:22,372 --> 00:51:24,999
For her, perhaps they could make
an exception.

494
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:29,003
If not, left to her own, I'm afraid
she'll become a poisonous dragon.

495
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:32,173
It's not our affair.

496
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:36,635
Even if Wudang accepts her,
her husband might object.

497
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:45,186
I thought by giving away the sword,
I could escape the Jiang Hu world.

498
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,814
But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

499
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:52,526
I had hoped so, too.

500
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:56,197
I wish there were something
I could do to help you.

501
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:04,038
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

502
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,097
Freeze!

503
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:28,020
-Lo!
-Jen!

504
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:43,410
You shouldn't have come.

505
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:48,541
With all the traffic
on your rooftop these days

506
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:53,087
it took me a while to get in here.
I can't wait any longer, Jen.

507
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:55,047
I was wrong to let you go.

508
00:52:56,383 --> 00:52:59,635
Come with me, back to the desert.
You'll be happy there.

509
00:53:00,095 --> 00:53:02,096
You can do whatever you want.

510
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,726
You have been looking for me all this time?

511
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,459
Jen, stop playing with it.

512
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:35,546
I won't break it.

513
00:53:57,777 --> 00:53:58,986
Charge!

514
00:54:01,823 --> 00:54:02,990
Stop!

515
00:54:03,992 --> 00:54:05,576
It's Dark Cloud!

516
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,578
Dark Cloud is coming!

517
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:26,013
Lower the shade, don't be seen!

518
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,098
Don't be afraid, Miss.

519
00:54:43,865 --> 00:54:46,200
Don't touch the women!

520
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:35,040
Come!

521
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:24,798
Hey!

522
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:28,844
Your mother is fine.
Hurry back to your mother.

523
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:29,655
Hey!

524
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:33,450
She's mine! Leave her to me!

525
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:46,839
-Let's take a break.
-Give me back my comb!

526
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:51,385
Take a break.

527
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,180
You're tired. You need rest.

528
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:04,523
Your horse needs water.
There's a spring up here.

529
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:14,741
Well, there was when I last visited.

530
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:22,875
Your name?

531
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:27,421
My name is Lo.
The Hans call me Dark Cloud.

532
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:31,550
I'm not that tall or that big,
but I'm quick as lightning.

533
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,177
Here

534
00:58:44,898 --> 00:58:46,398
Give me my comb.

535
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:24,913
If you like that, I can make you a bow.

536
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:27,499
Great for hunting pheasants.

537
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:29,376
They're delicious.

538
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:37,592
You need to eat something. Understand?

539
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:41,638
That way, you'll have the strength to fight.

540
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,017
Understand?

541
01:00:54,277 --> 01:00:57,446
You'll slowly regain your strength.
Don't rush.

542
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:06,867
You have a bad temper.
It's much better this way.

543
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:14,875
You coward!

544
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:21,631
Still in a bad mood? But you're speaking.

545
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:24,176
What's your name?

546
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:28,763
I didn't think the Hans had names like that.

547
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:12,641
Relax. If I wanted to do what you think
I want to do, I'd have done it already.

548
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:16,102
You must be dying for a bath.

549
01:04:16,187 --> 01:04:19,481
The water source is far,
and difficult to get to.

550
01:04:20,316 --> 01:04:22,734
I managed to bring back some fresh water.

551
01:04:22,818 --> 01:04:25,362
You can wear my clothes
when you are done.

552
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,322
They're clean.

553
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:44,923
Don't worry.

554
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:50,303
I'll sing a song, so you'll know where I am.

555
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:54,891
After the bath, you will calm down a little.

556
01:04:56,143 --> 01:04:59,062
But promise me,
no more rocks on the head.

557
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:15,221
-All this trouble, just for a comb?
-It's mine.

558
01:06:16,766 --> 01:06:20,894
And it's worth a lot to me.
But to a barbarian like you, it's nothing.

559
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,981
Not true. I can use it
to pick fleas from my horse.

560
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:28,568
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

561
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:33,406
I'm sorry, I guessed wrong.

562
01:06:34,075 --> 01:06:36,159
I thought you were a Han.

563
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:39,913
Give me back my comb.

564
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,670
I don't take orders from anyone.

565
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,803
Give it to me.

566
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:15,842
One night, when I was a boy

567
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:18,887
I saw a thousand stars fall out of the sky.

568
01:08:20,181 --> 01:08:23,141
I remember thinking,
where did they all go?

569
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:26,770
I'm an orphan.
I used to look for stars alone.

570
01:08:28,773 --> 01:08:32,525
Maybe if I rode to the other end
of the desert, I'd find them.

571
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:37,572
I've been riding in the desert ever since.

572
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:41,701
And that little boy became
a fearsome bandit.

573
01:08:41,786 --> 01:08:45,121
Couldn't find the stars,
so now he steals my comb.

574
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,209
Out there,
you're always fighting for survival.

575
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:53,213
You have to gang up
just to stand a chance.

576
01:08:53,964 --> 01:08:56,883
Slowly, your gang becomes your family.

577
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:01,221
All that Dark Cloud stuff
is just propaganda

578
01:09:01,305 --> 01:09:03,306
but it does make my life easier.

579
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:07,101
So you are still the little boy at heart

580
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:09,103
looking for fallen stars.

581
01:09:10,898 --> 01:09:16,611
I am a man. And I've found
the brightest star of them all.

582
01:09:39,635 --> 01:09:42,345
Your father's men are looking for you.

583
01:10:12,543 --> 01:10:15,420
They're still out there, circling closer.

584
01:10:17,131 --> 01:10:18,715
Let them look.

585
01:10:20,009 --> 01:10:22,969
They'll keep looking. It's trouble for me.

586
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:27,724
Don't even think of sending me back.

587
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:31,269
It's up to you.

588
01:10:31,604 --> 01:10:34,606
You might get tired of this

589
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:38,818
and start missing your family.

590
01:10:39,987 --> 01:10:42,989
If we had a daughter,
we'd look for her, too.

591
01:10:43,157 --> 01:10:44,908
She'd miss us, too.

592
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:54,375
Jen, I want you to be mine forever.

593
01:10:56,378 --> 01:11:00,506
What if I make my mark on the world,
earn your parents' respect?

594
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,762
We have a legend. Anyone who dares
to jump from the mountain,

595
01:11:06,055 --> 01:11:08,222
God will fulfill a wish of his.

596
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:12,518
A long time ago, a man's parents were ill,
so he jumped.

597
01:11:13,938 --> 01:11:16,689
He didn't die, wasn't even wounded.

598
01:11:18,025 --> 01:11:21,194
He just floated away, far away,
never to return.

599
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:24,822
He knew his wish had come true.

600
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,534
If you believe in it, it will happen.

601
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,454
I've asked Han people, they say,

602
01:11:31,914 --> 01:11:34,791
"A sincere heart will make
your dreams come true."

603
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:47,053
Keep it safe.

604
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:51,057
And return it to me
when we are together again.

605
01:11:53,602 --> 01:11:54,894
I will.

606
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:06,239
If you don't return it to me,
I will have to chase you down.

607
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:09,701
And next time, I won't go easy on you.

608
01:12:21,463 --> 01:12:24,924
Wherever I went,
they always recognized me.

609
01:12:25,718 --> 01:12:27,301
I really tried.

610
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:34,434
I heard you came to Beijing.
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

611
01:12:35,436 --> 01:12:37,061
So I came.

612
01:12:38,147 --> 01:12:40,857
I can't let you get married like that.

613
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:45,194
Go back.

614
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:47,405
Jen.

615
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,202
-Don't ever come back.
-This is it?

616
01:12:55,456 --> 01:12:56,622
Yes.

617
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:14,599
We heard noises. Is everything all right?

618
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:16,768
Fine. It was just a cat.

619
01:13:33,869 --> 01:13:36,329
You think Jade Fox will show up?

620
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,331
She must be nearby.

621
01:13:38,916 --> 01:13:41,334
But I doubt she'll show herself.

622
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:47,256
We'll keep our eyes open.
She'll come for the girl sooner or later.

623
01:14:06,902 --> 01:14:08,736
Jen!

624
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:19,122
Go back to Xin Jiang with me.

625
01:14:24,086 --> 01:14:28,506
Let go of me.

626
01:14:33,137 --> 01:14:34,387
You're mine.

627
01:14:34,888 --> 01:14:36,889
Go back to Xin Jiang with me.

628
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:52,446
Jen, come back to Xin Jiang with me.

629
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:02,039
-Tell me. Where is Jade Fox?
-Come with me. Hurry.

630
01:15:05,961 --> 01:15:09,755
You really thought she'd give it all up
and go back west with you?

631
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,135
-She's mine.
-Whether she's yours or not

632
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:18,097
you will be no good to her dead.
With Gou and Yu hunting you,

633
01:15:18,182 --> 01:15:20,933
it won't be long until
you're in their hands.

634
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:23,269
I don't care anymore.

635
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:28,274
If you truly loved her,
you wouldn't say that.

636
01:15:30,444 --> 01:15:32,945
Don't you want to see her again?

637
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:39,035
I'll write an introduction for you.
Take it to Wudang Mountain.

638
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:41,454
Wait there for news from me.

639
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:44,957
Okay.

640
01:15:53,342 --> 01:15:55,885
When will this end?

641
01:15:56,136 --> 01:15:58,971
They take it, put it back, and take it again.

642
01:15:59,139 --> 01:16:02,308
My place is no better than a warehouse.

643
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,560
Come in.

644
01:16:06,355 --> 01:16:08,814
-Speak.
-Jen Yu's run away.

645
01:16:09,149 --> 01:16:11,400
The groom found her missing.

646
01:16:11,485 --> 01:16:14,028
Chief Yu requests your assistance

647
01:16:14,488 --> 01:16:17,114
since you know
the Jiang Hu underworld so well.

648
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:20,201
He wants to find her
and keep her from harm.

649
01:16:21,245 --> 01:16:24,497
Sir Te, leave this to us. Don't worry.

650
01:16:43,392 --> 01:16:45,351
What can I serve you?

651
01:16:47,187 --> 01:16:49,021
This cup is dirty.

652
01:17:03,537 --> 01:17:08,541
Hi there. May I ask your name?

653
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:10,876
Long.

654
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:15,548
It's young master Long. My apologies!

655
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:18,384
I'm Iron Eagle Sung.

656
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:22,471
This is my fellow brother,
Flying Cougar Li Yun.

657
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:26,475
What brings you to Huai An
and where are you headed, Master Long?

658
01:17:27,936 --> 01:17:30,062
Anywhere there's action.

659
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:33,899
In that case,
perhaps we could be of assistance.

660
01:17:35,277 --> 01:17:36,819
Don't bother.

661
01:17:38,447 --> 01:17:40,906
You don't seem to be getting our drift.

662
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:44,744
So what if I don't?

663
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:49,623
We have ways of dealing with people
who don't get it.

664
01:17:58,175 --> 01:18:00,760
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

665
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:05,598
He's my defeated foe.

666
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,534
Some tea.

667
01:18:55,065 --> 01:18:56,357
Shu Lien.

668
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,735
There's no eternity
to the things we can touch.

669
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:03,864
My master used to say,

670
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:06,826
"There's nothing we can hold onto
in this world.

671
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:11,872
"Only by letting go can we
finally possess what is real."

672
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:17,002
Even to an old Taoist like you,
not everything is an illusion.

673
01:19:17,212 --> 01:19:20,798
When you were holding my hand just now,
wasn't that real?

674
01:19:23,385 --> 01:19:27,763
Your hand is cold and callused
from practicing machetes.

675
01:19:28,223 --> 01:19:32,935
All these years,
and I've never had the courage to touch it.

676
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:37,440
Crouching tigers and hidden dragons
are in the underworld

677
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:39,692
but so are human feelings.

678
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:43,904
Swords and knives harbor unknown
perils, but so do human relationships.

679
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:47,867
I gave away the Green Destiny
with sincerity.

680
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:50,411
But it brought us more troubles.

681
01:19:50,537 --> 01:19:53,581
Repressing your feelings
will only make them stronger.

682
01:19:53,707 --> 01:19:55,416
I can't repress my desire.

683
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:58,878
I want to be with you.

684
01:20:01,548 --> 01:20:03,257
Just sitting like this

685
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:07,178
gives me a sense of peace.

686
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:27,448
Please follow me.

687
01:20:29,284 --> 01:20:32,578
-I want a clean room.
-There are plenty of rooms.

688
01:20:34,623 --> 01:20:37,666
-What would you like to eat?
-Some steamed cod, fried ribs,

689
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:40,211
meatballs, not too big, with little starch!

690
01:20:40,295 --> 01:20:43,672
And cabbage soup with shark fins,
plus a bottle of warm rose wine.

691
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:46,467
I have to order them from
a bigger restaurant.

692
01:20:46,593 --> 01:20:48,594
-Hurry then.
-Yes.

693
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:32,680
It's him.

694
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:43,691
I am Iron Arm Mi.

695
01:21:43,984 --> 01:21:47,570
I heard a true master has arrived.

696
01:21:47,654 --> 01:21:49,947
I have come to seek a lesson.

697
01:22:02,502 --> 01:22:04,003
You asked for it!

698
01:22:24,357 --> 01:22:26,317
What kind of Iron Arm are you?

699
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:45,669
That's amazing technique!
I am Flying Machete.

700
01:22:45,754 --> 01:22:48,380
Are you related to Southern Crane?

701
01:22:48,882 --> 01:22:51,842
Southern Duck?
I don't eat anything with two feet.

702
01:22:52,093 --> 01:22:54,428
Who could remember such lengthy names?

703
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:55,721
You!

704
01:22:55,847 --> 01:23:00,684
If Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe,
why don't you know his master?

705
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:03,270
Who are you?

706
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:08,776
I'm Phoenix Mountain Gou.

707
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:13,113
Gou? I hate that name.

708
01:23:13,281 --> 01:23:15,699
I feel like throwing up
when I hear that name.

709
01:23:15,784 --> 01:23:20,245
Too bad you're named Gou!
You'll be the first to taste my sword today.

710
01:23:42,602 --> 01:23:46,605
Hold it! Don't you know Monk Jing?

711
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:50,025
A monk eating meat and not reading
scriptures? You need a lesson, too.

712
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:54,279
-Who the hell are you?
-I am...

713
01:23:54,489 --> 01:23:55,739
I am...

714
01:23:55,824 --> 01:23:57,950
Be careful of her sword!

715
01:24:00,787 --> 01:24:03,622
...the invincible Sword Goddess

716
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:09,586
with the Green Destiny
that has no equal

717
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:16,969
be it Li or Southern Eagle.

718
01:24:18,596 --> 01:24:21,265
Lower your head and ask for mercy!

719
01:24:28,481 --> 01:24:30,816
I'm the dragon from the desert

720
01:24:39,951 --> 01:24:42,828
with no trace to be discovered
in my wake.

721
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:56,508
Today I fly over Eh-Mei Mountain,

722
01:24:58,678 --> 01:25:02,347
tomorrow, I'll uproot
the last dregs of Wudang!

723
01:25:17,822 --> 01:25:21,867
We politely asked for a friendly match,
but she showed no respect

724
01:25:22,076 --> 01:25:23,368
and started to reproach and attack us.

725
01:25:23,453 --> 01:25:27,122
My friends offered to come by
and teach her a lesson.

726
01:25:27,207 --> 01:25:29,374
Her sword is just too powerful.

727
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:33,086
I've travelled far and wide,
but I've never met anyone that uncivilized.

728
01:25:33,171 --> 01:25:37,090
She kept accusing me of being
the brother of Gou Jun Pei.

729
01:25:37,509 --> 01:25:40,219
Who is this guy Gou, anyway?

730
01:25:42,055 --> 01:25:43,555
Her husband.

731
01:25:55,735 --> 01:25:59,613
Sun Security is nearby. Why don't you
go home and see how things are going?

732
01:25:59,697 --> 01:26:03,200
-What about you?
-I'll look around and catch up later.

733
01:26:03,576 --> 01:26:06,703
Not a bad idea.
Let's stay at Sun Security tonight.

734
01:26:06,788 --> 01:26:08,914
-Get a good night's sleep.
-Yes.

735
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:36,275
-You are back.
-Yes.

736
01:26:40,947 --> 01:26:42,823
You're back, Master!

737
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,869
-Hello guys. How's home?
-Things are fine.

738
01:26:46,953 --> 01:26:50,414
-You've been gone a while.
-Something came up. I leave tomorrow.

739
01:26:50,498 --> 01:26:52,541
-Wei, your wife was due?
-Yes, a baby girl.

740
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:55,711
-A girl? Good.
-I'd be happy if she grows up like you.

741
01:26:57,005 --> 01:26:59,923
-Mrs. Wu.
-You're back!

742
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:03,218
-How's the arm? Still sore?
-Much better.

743
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,637
I've been worried about you.

744
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:09,641
Mrs. Wu,
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.

745
01:27:11,144 --> 01:27:14,062
Really? I'll go and tidy up the room then.

746
01:27:43,259 --> 01:27:44,718
Sister Yu!

747
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:54,519
You came to find me.
Let's find you some proper clothes.

748
01:27:54,604 --> 01:27:58,148
I'm just borrowing them.
I'm not moving in.

749
01:27:59,692 --> 01:28:03,195
You get around pretty well.
I don't think you need my clothes.

750
01:28:04,572 --> 01:28:08,200
I just happened to be around.
I wanted to see how you're doing.

751
01:28:09,702 --> 01:28:11,203
Sister...

752
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,875
Now, now.
With all the trouble you've caused,

753
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,711
now you know what Jiang Hu life
is really like.

754
01:28:19,796 --> 01:28:22,965
You came here,
that means you think of me as your sister.

755
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:26,009
If so, let me give you some sisterly advice.

756
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:30,097
You don't have to marry,
you can't just leave your parents.

757
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:33,475
But they're the ones
who forced me to get married.

758
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:37,521
Go back to your parents first.
Then you can decide about Lo.

759
01:28:39,565 --> 01:28:41,358
You know about Lo?

760
01:28:49,409 --> 01:28:52,327
He really loves you.

761
01:28:53,246 --> 01:28:57,207
Come back to Beijing with me.
We'll figure a way out for you.

762
01:29:01,546 --> 01:29:04,965
-Where is he now?
-Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.

763
01:29:06,551 --> 01:29:10,262
-Li Mu Bai?
-He sent him to Wudang Mountain.

764
01:29:11,848 --> 01:29:14,766
So, you're all working together
to set me up.

765
01:29:14,934 --> 01:29:17,102
Shut up! How dare you accuse us!

766
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:19,771
From the beginning,
I knew you stole the Green Destiny!

767
01:29:19,856 --> 01:29:22,274
I've done nothing but protect you
and your family.

768
01:29:22,442 --> 01:29:24,943
And you've repaid me
with nothing but contempt.

769
01:29:25,028 --> 01:29:27,904
Li Mu Bai spared you,
and all you do is insult him.

770
01:29:27,989 --> 01:29:31,408
All we hoped for was a little peace,
and you've ruined it for us!

771
01:29:31,492 --> 01:29:33,577
You're no sister of mine!

772
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:37,706
I don't give a damn.

773
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:40,792
Friendship is not real anyway.

774
01:29:40,877 --> 01:29:44,546
But I wonder,
how long could you last as my enemy?

775
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:49,134
Put the sword down.

776
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:00,979
Jen!

777
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:06,443
Everyone out. Shut the doors.

778
01:30:17,538 --> 01:30:19,623
Fine. No more friendship.

779
01:33:35,569 --> 01:33:37,654
That's Li Mu Bai's sword.

780
01:33:38,948 --> 01:33:41,199
Come and get it if you can.

781
01:33:41,742 --> 01:33:44,911
You just rely on the Green Destiny
to do your fighting.

782
01:33:45,496 --> 01:33:48,623
Don't blame the weapon
if you can't fight me.

783
01:33:52,128 --> 01:33:54,212
Go ahead. Take your pick.

784
01:33:55,047 --> 01:33:56,172
I'll wait.

785
01:33:58,551 --> 01:33:59,592
Go ahead.

786
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:56,566
Give me the sword.

787
01:34:58,527 --> 01:34:59,611
Take it!

788
01:35:04,492 --> 01:35:05,658
Stop!

789
01:35:08,954 --> 01:35:10,622
You are not worthy of this sword.

790
01:35:10,873 --> 01:35:13,208
Not another lecture! On guard!

791
01:35:15,628 --> 01:35:19,422
-Stop yourself before I do.
-Now the sword will settle it.

792
01:35:55,042 --> 01:35:59,671
I didn't force you at the monastery
because I wanted to see the real you.

793
01:36:05,261 --> 01:36:08,263
What do you know about seeing
a true heart?

794
01:37:50,115 --> 01:37:53,201
-Why can't you leave me alone?
-I'll say it again,

795
01:37:53,285 --> 01:37:54,994
let me teach you.

796
01:38:27,611 --> 01:38:30,989
Okay, if you can take back the sword
in three moves

797
01:38:31,991 --> 01:38:34,033
I will go with you.

798
01:38:38,122 --> 01:38:40,123
-Give it back.
-Greet your master.

799
01:38:40,207 --> 01:38:42,458
-You wish.
-Then the sword is useless.

800
01:39:57,951 --> 01:40:01,579
It's only a matter of time before
those guys get their revenge.

801
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:05,625
Your parents value their reputation.
They'll never take you back.

802
01:40:08,629 --> 01:40:13,216
What good's a home? You've gone so far.
Now we can go all the way together.

803
01:40:13,926 --> 01:40:16,010
You'll always be my Lady.

804
01:40:19,014 --> 01:40:22,934
After all, happiness is the most
important thing in life, isn't it?

805
01:40:23,143 --> 01:40:25,645
We'll be our own masters at last.

806
01:40:26,271 --> 01:40:29,399
All we have left is each other, isn't that so?

807
01:40:34,113 --> 01:40:36,030
Now lie down and rest.

808
01:40:58,887 --> 01:41:01,764
Crazy girl like that,
you should have killed her.

809
01:41:01,849 --> 01:41:03,975
I didn't have the heart to do it.

810
01:41:04,101 --> 01:41:06,269
Maybe Li Mu Bai can do it.

811
01:42:17,132 --> 01:42:19,509
Is it me or the sword you want?

812
01:42:39,863 --> 01:42:41,739
You've been drugged.

813
01:42:59,633 --> 01:43:01,342
Where's Jade Fox?

814
01:43:43,844 --> 01:43:45,553
What's going on?

815
01:43:46,638 --> 01:43:48,514
Jade Fox drugged her.

816
01:43:49,057 --> 01:43:50,933
How did you get here?

817
01:43:53,103 --> 01:43:54,979
We followed Jade Fox.

818
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:58,691
Watch out!

819
01:43:58,692 --> 01:43:59,400
Watch out!

820
01:44:09,494 --> 01:44:10,912
Governess!

821
01:44:25,177 --> 01:44:27,136
This is the end of the road.

822
01:44:29,389 --> 01:44:31,140
For you too.

823
01:44:39,483 --> 01:44:41,275
A poisoned needle!

824
01:44:44,988 --> 01:44:46,822
You deserve to die

825
01:44:48,575 --> 01:44:50,409
but I was really

826
01:44:50,869 --> 01:44:53,287
aiming at Jen.

827
01:44:55,165 --> 01:44:57,166
Ten years I sacrificed

828
01:44:57,542 --> 01:44:59,585
but you deceived me.

829
01:45:00,671 --> 01:45:04,256
You hid the book's true meaning.
I never improved

830
01:45:05,676 --> 01:45:09,345
but your progress was limitless.

831
01:45:11,556 --> 01:45:13,557
You know what poison is?

832
01:45:14,309 --> 01:45:17,144
An eight-year-old girl who's full of deceit!

833
01:45:17,646 --> 01:45:19,355
That's poison!

834
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,485
Jen!

835
01:45:26,321 --> 01:45:27,822
My only love,

836
01:45:29,241 --> 01:45:30,741
my only enemy!

837
01:45:40,252 --> 01:45:43,546
You can't die! Tell us,
what poison did you use?

838
01:45:43,755 --> 01:45:45,381
What poison?

839
01:45:45,882 --> 01:45:48,426
You can't die, tell us the antidote!

840
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:51,429
You can't let him die! Li Mu Bai can't die!

841
01:45:51,555 --> 01:45:53,889
-It's the Purple Yin Poison.
-What?

842
01:45:54,766 --> 01:45:58,102
Purple Yin Poison.
It goes straight to the heart.

843
01:46:01,023 --> 01:46:04,567
My blood will stop flowing
within two hours.

844
01:46:06,278 --> 01:46:09,280
It's the same poison that killed my master.

845
01:46:10,949 --> 01:46:14,201
-There's no antidote.
-There must be an antidote!

846
01:46:14,786 --> 01:46:18,456
Every living thing has its antithesis.
And not this?

847
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:22,543
There is. Fox taught it to me.

848
01:46:23,045 --> 01:46:27,465
The recipe isn't complicated, but the
ingredients are hard to find. It takes time.

849
01:46:34,473 --> 01:46:36,140
Please, trust me.

850
01:46:36,641 --> 01:46:39,810
As you have helped me, let me help him.

851
01:46:42,481 --> 01:46:44,440
All right. Hurry up.

852
01:46:44,983 --> 01:46:47,234
Maybe I can hold on for two hours.

853
01:46:47,319 --> 01:46:49,904
Ride my horse to headquarters.
They have the ingredients.

854
01:46:49,988 --> 01:46:52,490
Give this to Mrs. Wu.
She'll help you. Hurry!

855
01:46:52,949 --> 01:46:56,327
Save your breath.
Guard your energy. I'll be back.

856
01:47:21,937 --> 01:47:23,604
Who is this?

857
01:47:25,899 --> 01:47:28,275
Mrs. Wu! Where's Mrs. Wu?

858
01:47:28,485 --> 01:47:29,819
Stop it!

859
01:47:31,196 --> 01:47:33,989
Yu gave me this
and told me to come to you.

860
01:47:35,117 --> 01:47:36,826
Let her come in!

861
01:47:50,715 --> 01:47:53,050
Mu Bai, hold on.

862
01:47:57,556 --> 01:47:59,348
Give me some hope.

863
01:48:24,249 --> 01:48:25,708
Shu Lien.

864
01:48:27,252 --> 01:48:29,336
Don't waste your breath.

865
01:48:31,256 --> 01:48:33,215
My life is departing.

866
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:37,094
I've only one breath left.

867
01:48:39,598 --> 01:48:42,266
Use your last bit of strength to meditate.

868
01:48:42,767 --> 01:48:47,271
Free yourself from this world
as you've been taught.

869
01:48:48,899 --> 01:48:53,068
Let your soul rise to eternity
with your last breath.

870
01:48:55,238 --> 01:48:58,407
Don't waste it on me.

871
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:04,455
I've already wasted my whole life.

872
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:08,626
I want to tell you
with my remaining strength

873
01:49:10,462 --> 01:49:12,796
that I love you. I always have.

874
01:49:48,583 --> 01:49:52,503
I'll drift next to you everyday as a ghost

875
01:49:53,922 --> 01:49:55,756
just to be with you.

876
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:01,762
Even if I was banished
to the darkest place,

877
01:50:04,307 --> 01:50:05,516
my love

878
01:50:09,104 --> 01:50:12,982
will keep me from being a lonely spirit.

879
01:51:09,122 --> 01:51:10,581
He's gone?

880
01:51:39,903 --> 01:51:41,445
Bo,

881
01:51:42,113 --> 01:51:44,740
please take this sword back to Sir Te's.

882
01:51:51,956 --> 01:51:56,210
You may go to Wudang Mountain.
Lo awaits you there.

883
01:51:57,670 --> 01:52:01,924
Promise me whatever path
you decide to take in this life,

884
01:52:03,093 --> 01:52:04,927
be true to yourself.

885
01:52:52,684 --> 01:52:53,851
Jen!

886
01:53:54,704 --> 01:53:55,787
Jen.

887
01:53:59,459 --> 01:54:02,127
Remember the story
you told me in the desert?

888
01:54:04,422 --> 01:54:07,424
Have faith, then the dreams will come true.

889
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:15,390
Make a wish, Lo.

890
01:54:17,936 --> 01:54:21,438
I wish that we'll be in the desert,
together again.
