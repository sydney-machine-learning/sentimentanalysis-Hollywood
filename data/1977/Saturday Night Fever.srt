- Just a minute.

Look what I got for you,
Carnival, gold, just like you wanted.

Where have you been?
I've been here for a half hour.

58
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,336
That's all right. Look, I'm gonna
make you a deal on this paint.

- I'm very angry with you.
- That's all right.

Look, I'm gonna make you
a nice deal on this. $1 off for you.

it gives them a sense of power.

67
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,775
I need some brushes.

68
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,860
All right, how much painting
you planning to do?

69
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,447
After these two rooms,
I wouldn't paint my wife's ass purple.

70
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,199
What color is it now?

71
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,034
You wanna know
what color my wife's ass is?

72
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,869
You brung it up.

73
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:49,374
Actually, it ain't got no color,
just stripes, them stretch stripes.

74
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:50,875
What about them brushes?

75
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,379
Right. See that second display counter?
Over there.

76
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:04,639
- Hey, Mr. Fusco, can I get an advance?
- Payday's Monday.

77
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,557
I know payday is Monday,

78
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:08,810
but every place else
is Friday or Saturday.

79
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,478
And they're broke on Monday.

80
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,563
- Boozing, whoring...
- Oh, come off it.

81
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,732
Pissing away their money all weekend.

82
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:17,735
This way, you're paid on a Monday,
you got money all week.

83
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,406
- You can save a little, build a future.
- Oh, fuck the future.

84
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:27,078
No, Tony, you can't fuck the future,
the future fucks you.

85
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:31,332
It catches up with you, and it fucks you
if you ain't planned for it.

86
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,085
Look, tonight is the future,
and I am planning for it.

87
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,004
There's a shirt I gotta buy,
a beautiful shirt. Blue...

88
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,381
Sorry, Tony, no exceptions.

89
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,261
Just wait till you need an advance,
all right?

90
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,721

Where you been?

103

Dinner's gonna be late tonight,
they was out of things at the market.

104
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,596
But you'd have been late
if it was normal.

- Hey, hot stuff. Give me a kiss.

when you know that I gotta work till 6:00
and I can't make dinner on time.

143
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,514
You should've been a priest,
like your brother,

00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:36,017
you wouldn't worry about a job.

Yeah.

146
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,938
Every time you mention Frank, Jr.,
you gotta cross yourself?

00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:44,984
He's a priest, ain't he?
Father Frank, Jr., your brother.

148

Your mother doesn't have much
to cross herself about these days.

Like hell, you will.

159
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:15,723
Twenty-five years in construction work,
I always brought home a paycheck.

00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,893
What, six, seven months
I'm out of work?

161
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,394
Then, all of a sudden, what?

162
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,897
- You're hitting me and talking back.
- All right, all right.

163
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,148
Talking about getting a job
and hitting me.

164
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:26,734
All right, all right. No hitting,
no slapping at the dinner table. Okay?

165
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:30,363
That's the rule.
And you was the one that was hitting.

166
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,865
You never hit me before. Never.

167
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,534

00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:44,961
- One pork chop! One!
- Hey, Frank!

169
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,505
It's disgusting, Ma. He's sick.

170
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,132
Will you just watch the hair?

171
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:54,011
You know, I work on my hair a long time
and you hit it.

172
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,763
He hits my hair.

173
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:01,269
Take care of his hair.
I'm gonna take a walk.

174
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:08,818
Tony, you walk me to church later?

175
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,403
Didn't you go already today?

176
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:12,780
Yeah, confession.
I gotta go back and pray for something.

177
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,198
For what?

178
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,827
I gotta pray
for Father Frank, Jr. to call me.

179
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,245
Why don't you call him direct?

180
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,956
I want him to call me.
A son should call his mother.

181
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,502
Wait a minute. You're going to church
to have God make Frank, Jr. call you?

182
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,879
- Right.
- I don't believe it.

183
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,967
You know, you're turning God
into a telephone operator.

184
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,903
Go, go, now!

185
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:55,948
Hey, you scumbags! Get back here!

186
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,535
- Assholes.
- Come on, fuckhead!

187
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,538
Hey, the stubborn fuck won't budge.

188
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,476
- Will you put two hands on the wheel?
- I got two hands on the wheel!

189
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,770
Hey, you know, you assholes
almost broke my pussy finger.

190
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,439
Oh, yeah, you wouldn't know
which one it was.

191
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,607
Hey, get some of this, will you?

192
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,941
Hey, Gus, tell them what we got.

193
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:33,110
Oh, yeah, we got some ups,
we got some downs,

194
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:35,529
three ludes, two Js,
and a half a bottle of vodka.

195
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:36,906
All right, yeah, yeah!

196
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:40,409
That's what you got, huh?
I bet I'd get a bigger high from a fart.

197
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:41,952
- You want something?
- No.

198
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,580
We ain't dropping nothing till I say so.

199
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,749
- Oh, come on. Why the fuck not?
- Hey, bullshit.

200
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,584
I got my reasons, all right?
I got my reasons.

201
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,586
Oh, fuck, Tony.
What's wrong with you, man?

202
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:51,879
Hey, give me the vodka.

203
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,423
Hey, when're you gonna get new tapes?
These things are four years old.

204
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:56,342
I bought them in the bargain basement.

205
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,803
You don't like my tapes?
I'll get new tapes.

206
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:12,066
<i>Someone mad is going wild</i>

207
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:17,405
<i>And look, uh-oh
It's a one-man style</i>

208
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:25,413
<i>Doctor Disco</i>

209
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,462
Hey, looking sharp, huh?

210
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,464
Sharp as you can look
without turning into a nigger.

211
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,383
- Or a spic.
- Spic, spic.

212
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,884
Would you put your dick in a spic?

213
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,053
- Does it get bigger in a nigger?
- I don't know.

214
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:42,346
I gotta score tonight, man.

215
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,306
I'm horny, you know what I mean?
Horny.

216
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,892
Yeah, man, I know what you mean.
Horny, right? Horny!

217
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:49,019
Hey, anybody scores,
you get in the car for 10 minutes,

218
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,563
and you're out for the next guy, all right?

219
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,481
If you get five, you get
a medal of honor with rubies,

220
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:53,649
and a piece of the Pope's ass.

221
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:54,817
What are you talking about, man?

222
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,402
The Pope don't got no ass,
that's why he's the Pope.

223
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,821
Now, shape up, you assholes.
We're the faces.

224
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,858
Tony, how's it going? All right?

225
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,753
Hey, Moe!

226
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,978
Hey, Tony, you seen Pauline
around here at all?

227
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,438
No, we ain't seen Pauline.

228
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,774
Joey, you seen Pauline?

229
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,235
Hi. What would you like?

230
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:22,530
- Oh, give me a Seven and Seven.
- Yeah, I'll take a beer.

231
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:23,906
Hey, I'd like a vodka and tonic.

232
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,742
You guys wanna go see the Knicks
on Tuesday? Anybody?

233
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,286
- Give me a...
- Wanna see the Knicks?

234
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,720
Tony.

235
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,683
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, "yeah"?

236
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,268
Well, I mean, I could dance with you,

237
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:55,729
but, you know, you're not
my dream girl or nothing like that.

238
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,109
You want a dream girl?

239
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,903
Well, then go to sleep
and have a nightmare.

240
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,406
Hey, Gus, here's the speed.

241
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,200
What are you doing? Here, take this.

242
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:11,453
<i>Hello, again. This is beautiful Monti,
your delicious deejay,</i>

243
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,664
<i>reminding you about
the Universal Disco sweepstakes,</i>

244
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,250
<i>so get in line to get the prize.</i>

245
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,795
- Oh, looks good!
- Go, baby.

246
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,189
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

247
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:43,444
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

248
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:47,114
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

249
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:51,285
<i>A trip. A good trip.
Feel the music, baby.</i>

250
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,038
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

251
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,207
<i>Disco inferno
Burn, baby, burn</i>

252
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,585
<i>Burn that mama down</i>

253
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,254
Look at that chick.
I'm gonna dance with her.

254
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:03,672
Which one?

255
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,717
<i>One hundred storeys high</i>

256
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:09,261
Come on, Tony! Dance!

257
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:14,892
<i>Getting down on the roof
Do you hear?</i>

258
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:21,023
<i>Folks were screaming
Out of control</i>

259
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,652
<i>It was so entertaining</i>

260
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:25,944
All right!

261
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,031
<i>When the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say</i>

262
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,033
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

263
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:34,328
<i>Disco inferno
Burn, baby, burn</i>

264
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,830
<i>Burn that mama down</i>

265
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,583
<i>Satisfaction</i>

266
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,587
<i>Came in a chain reaction</i>

267
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,798
<i>It's so beautiful in there.
I like your new haircuts.</i>

268
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:48,801
<i>I like that polyester look.
Turn yourself there, baby.</i>

269
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,890
<i>The heat was on</i>

270
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,685
<i>Rising to the top</i>

271
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,436
All right!

272
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,522
Yeah!

273
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,402
<i>I heard somebody say</i>

274
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:07,736
Hey, Tony, you know something?

275
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,406
You're the king out there.
You're great. You're a great dancer.

276
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,449
You could do as good as me
if you practiced.

277
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,535
Yeah?
Think I'd be a good dancer, Tony?

278
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,537
Sure. Why not? No.

279
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:18,956
- No?
- No.

280
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,751
- Ain't you gonna ask me to sit down?
- No, you'd do it.

281
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:26,171
- But you'd ask me to lay down.
- No, you would not do it.

282
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:29,508
Double J, move over.
I want you to meet my friend here.

283
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,676
Hey.

284
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,219
Hey, Tony, listen,
you want some speed?

285
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:35,180
It's very good stuff, Ton.
Really, it's good stuff. You want some?

286
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,141
Can't you guys
get off on dancing?

287
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:40,644
Tony, can I wipe off your forehead?

288
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,564
Why not? Sure. Go ahead.

289
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,653
Hey, Doreen, it ain't no blowjob.

290
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:51,780
You don't know fuck
about women, Joey.

291
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:53,866
You get a blowjob easier
than you get that.

292
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,284
I noticed.

293
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,286
I love to watch you dance, Tony.

294
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,206
- Oh, yeah?
- I love it. I love to watch you dance.

295
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,711
I just love it, watching you dance.

296
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,296
Hey, Tony, listen, do her a favor.

297
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,047
Why don't you take her
for a dance, huh?

298
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,257
That's a good idea. Wanna dance?

299
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,800
Would you like to dance with me?
I'd dance with you.

300
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,594
It's for charity.

301
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,972
Any kind of dresses
with the lace on the side.

302
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,349
Weirdest chick I ever seen.

303
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:23,520
Ton, I love to watch you dance.

304
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,734
I just love it, watching you dance.

305
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:32,362
Doreen, move up a little bit.
Come on, doll.

306
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,073
She's doing a two-step with him.
Jesus Christ.

307
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,076
Get your head out of his belt, there, doll.

308
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,536
Oh, Jesus.

309
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,499
You can't dance to this shit.

310
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,502
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- I paid $5 to hear this shit?

311
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,421
You paid $5?
I fucking paid for you to get in.

312
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:53,217
Hey, Monti,
what are you playing that shit for?

313
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,010
What are you talking about, baby?

314
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,430
Look at that chick, she's dancing, man.
She's grooving.

315
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,792
- Joey?
- Yeah.

316
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,544
You know that girl?

317
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,464
No.

318
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,008
- You ever see her before?
- No.

319
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:39,388
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I seen her here
about a month ago.

320
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,855
She can dance, you know that?

321
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:51,191
She got the wrong partner, of course,
but she can dance.

322
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:56,154
- Go ask her.
- Fuck you.

323
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,156
Yeah? Which position?

324
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,793
Who the hell's that guy?

325
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,017
- Hey, Penny.
- Hey, Tony!

326
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,019
- How you doing?
- Okay. How you been?

327
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,812
All right. You gonna dance for me?

328
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,898
- Sure, why not?
- Okay.

329
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,360
<i>I'm surviving every lonely day</i>

330
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:38,113
- Hello, Lucille.
- Hello, Nureyev. How you doing?

331
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,575
- You got a Seven and Seven for me?
- Sure, doll.

332
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,993
Give me one of your butts, too,
all right?

333
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,494
Sure.

334
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,663
<i>And it doesn't matter how I cry</i>

335
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,874
<i>My tears of love</i>

336
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,168
Having another sweepstakes.

337
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,711
I know that.

338
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:56,089
It's double the prize money. $500.

339
00:20:56,173 --> 00:21:00,886
<i>Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do</i>

340
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,763
You gonna enter?

341
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,349
Well, you'll need a partner.

342
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:09,937
<i>I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you</i>

343
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,774
We won before.

344
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,818
But we're gonna have to practice.

345
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,195
<i>If I can't have you</i>

346
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,988
We'll have to practice.

347
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,449
They got people coming in
from Manhattan.

348
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,993
Revelation, Gazebo's.
You know that, right?

349
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:27,454
We'll have to practice.

350
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,914
That's "practice," Annette.

351
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,458
It don't mean dating,
it don't mean socializing,

352
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,377
it means practice.

353
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,422
Why not? We had a date.

354
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,467
Yeah, once, and once was enough.

355
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,344
Why?

356
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:46,139
Why? Annette, the whole time,
you talked about your married sister.

357
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:49,142
And then, you was talking
about your other married sister.

358
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,852
And then, your third married sister.

359
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,771
I got the idea
that all you was interested in

360
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,648
was being a married sister yourself.

361
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,608
I got bored with it.

362
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:59,736
Hey, look, I told you
I'd take care of it, huh?

363
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,990
Hey, Tony, look, Double J's been
in the car 25 minutes with some chick.

364
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,157
So what?

365
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,952
So, I can't get the selfish prick out.

366
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:10,414
These guys can't do nothing without me,
you know that?

367
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,916
<i>If I can't have you</i>

368
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:20,340
<i>If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby</i>

369
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,509
<i>If I can't have you</i>

370
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,180
Hey, listen, are you gonna
make it with Annette?

371
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,141
No, I don't think so.

372
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,226
You know, Joey, you make it
with some of these chicks,

373
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,644
and they think
you gotta dance with them.

374
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:34,187
Look at this guy, huh?

375
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,732
All right, get out.
You've been in there 20 minutes.

376
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:39,568
- Come on!
- 25 in the car, 20 in the chick.

377
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,821
Yeah, well, get out
before we pull you out.

378
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:46,116
- She ain't come yet.
- Since when do you care?

379
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,038
Hey, come on!

380
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,415
Whoa. Okay.

381
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,375
- Harder! Harder!
- Okay, it's happening!

382
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,336
It's happening! It's happening!

383
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,547
I'll be out in a minute, man.

384
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,467
Harder! I'm coming!
I'm coming!

385
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,552
Oh, yeah!

386
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:09,890
Yes.

387
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,813
What did you say your name was?

388
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:32,621
<i>Listen to the ground
There is movement all around</i>

389
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,292
<i>There is something going down
And I can feel it</i>

390
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,044
<i>On the waves of the air</i>

391
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,420
Kiss me.

392
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,631
Kiss me!

393
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,759
<i>If it's something we can share
We can steal it</i>

394
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,804
Oh, I just kissed Al Pacino!

395
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,847
<i>She moves through the light</i>

396
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:54,351
<i>Controlling my mind and my soul</i>

397
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:59,189
<i>When you reach out for me, yeah
And the feeling is bright</i>

398
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,943
<i>Then I get night fever
Night fever</i>

399
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,821
<i>We know how to do it</i>

400
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:12,077
<i>Give me that night fever
Night fever</i>

401
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,704
<i>We know how to show it</i>

402
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:23,088
<i>Here I am
Praying for this moment to last</i>

403
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:29,636
<i>Living on the music so fine
Borne on the wind</i>

404
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:34,766
<i>Making it mine</i>

405
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:38,520
<i>Night fever
Night fever</i>

406
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,564
<i>We know how to do it</i>

407
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,817
<i>Feels like forever, baby
Don't you know</i>

408
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,404
<i>Give me that night fever
Night fever</i>

409
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,573
<i>We know how to show it</i>

410
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:58,456
<i>Here I am
Praying for this moment to last</i>

411
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:04,963
<i>Living on the music so fine
Borne on the wind</i>

412
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:10,051
<i>Making it mine</i>

413
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,722
<i>Night fever
Night fever</i>

414
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,183
<i>We know how to do it</i>

415
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,977
<i>Feels like forever, baby
Don't you know</i>

416
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,647
<i>Give me that night fever
Night fever</i>

417
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,608
<i>We know how to show it</i>

418
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,569
<i>Feels like forever, baby
Don't you know</i>

419
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:31,364
<i>Give me that night fever
Night fever</i>

420
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,283
<i>We know how to do it</i>

421
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,328
<i>Feels like forever, baby
Don't you know</i>

422
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:40,165
<i>Give me that night fever
Night fever</i>

423
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:42,375
<i>We know how to show it</i>

424
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,128
<i>Feels like forever, baby
Don't you know</i>

425
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:49,007
<i>Give me that night fever
Night fever</i>

426
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,718
<i>We know how to show it</i>

427
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,215
Al Pacino. I don't look like Al Pacino.

428
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:34,261
Well, I could look like him.

429
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,720
Al Pacino.

430
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,515
Yeah. Al Pacino.

431
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,062
Al Pacino!

432
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:46,398
"Attica! Attica!

433
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,608
"Attica! Attica!

434
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,360
- "Attica!"
<i>- Hey, give me the ball.</i>

435
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,947
Hey, you wanna go see
that Bruce Lee picture at the Orpheum?

436
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,198
- Yeah!
- Hey, you wanna know something?

437
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,242
Bruce Lee's dead,
so I don't give a damn about him.

438
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,828
- Hey, look.
- Man, you got no respect for the dead.

439
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:01,121
What kind of shit is that, huh?

440
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,039
Hey, you guys see what the Knicks
are gonna pay Frazier?

441
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:05,333
We're never gonna make
that much money in our whole life.

442
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:08,753
- Hey, douche! Douche!
- It's all right. It's okay.

443
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,131
Hey, you know why
you don't kill fags on Sunday?

444
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,675
You kill fags on Sunday,
they go straight to heaven.

445
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,385
Hey, sweetheart! Hey, your turn, isn't it?

446
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,762
You look so heavenly,
it makes me want to die, you know?

447
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,639
Hey, Double J, hey!

448
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,267
You know, this is a drag.

449
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,602
What's with you today, huh?

450
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,813
Nothing.
I'd just rather be doing 2001 tonight.

451
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,356
Yeah? Well, fucking do it.

452
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,650
Oh, "fucking do it."
20, 30 bucks, asshole!

453
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,861
You got 20, 30 bucks
to blow twice a week?

454
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,696
- Come on, Tony.
- Hey, Tony.

455
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:37,115
Man, I'm gonna get myself
one of these, you know.

456
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,575
You're never gonna get yourself
one of these.

457
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:39,743
These things cost too much money.

458
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:40,910
You'll never have that kind of money.

459
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,537
Hey, you, you know,
I've had you up to here.

460
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,872
That's your favorite speech.

461
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:45,040
You're never gonna have
that kind of money.

462
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,249
Not you, not me, not anybody.

463
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,044
Hey, get it together before it's all
over the street, huh? You see this?

464
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,462
This is a Caddy Seville.

465
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:53,089
My Uncle Nunzio's got one of these
and he's got a Mercedes Benz, too.

466
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,299
You know how he got it?

467
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:57,260
He forced his partner to sell out.
He gave him a real screwing.

468
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:00,305
It's a dog-eat-dog world, right?
Everybody's out for what they can get.

469
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,389
It's true.

470
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,516
They got it all locked up.

471
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,477
Ain't nobody gonna give you a chance.

472
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,687
Nobody gives you nothing, Joey.

473
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,147
It's a stinking rat race.

474
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,858
Yeah, you know,
it's every man for himself.

475
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,693
Hey, pull over to the side and let me out.

476
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:14,819
What?

477
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,654
I said, pull over to the side
and let me out.

478
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:17,697
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

479
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,158
Hey, I said, pull over to the side
and let me out.

480
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:24,180
Hey, that stuff goes on beautiful, Tony.
Best vinyl I ever seen at that price.

481
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,849
See? I told you.
You just listen to me, right?

482
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,602
You know, you saved me a bit
of change on the job. You know paint.

483
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,855
You ever want a job as a painter,
why don't you let me know, huh?

484
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:33,690
You make twice as much
as you make here,

485
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:35,984
but you break your back.
You interested?

486
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,986
- I don't know.
- Don't be interested.

487
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:41,573
You'll make twice as much,
but you'll break your back.

488
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:44,951
<i>- No advances, no nothing. It's payday...
- I gave you a raise.</i>

489
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,245
- You gave me what?
- A raise.

490
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:51,124
- You kidding me?
- No. Come on, look. See how much it is.

491
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,585
You gave me a raise? Thank you.
I can't believe this.

492
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,044
Wait, hold on, you better look first.

493
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,754
I don't gotta look.
It don't make no difference.

494
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,423
You gave me a raise.
That's the important thing.

495
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,842
- It's only $2.50.
- So what?

496
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,303
That's $2.50. It ain't much.

497
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,930
The important thing is it's a raise.
I think that's really great.

498
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,932
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna give you $3.50, all right?

499
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,392
- You do not have to, Mr. Fusco.
- I'll give you $3.50.

500
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,436
- I like the raise just the way it is.
- I'll give you $1 more.

501
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,313
Shut up, will you? $4.

502
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,607
I'll make it an even $4.

503
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,983
Christ, I've never seen anybody

504
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,611
so shit-ass happy over
a crummy $2.50 raise.

505
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:23,156
Wait a minute. $2?
You just said $4.00, didn't you?

506
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:29,704
What the hell are you doing?

507
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,165
- I just feel like it, all right?
- Girls do that.

508
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,292
I got a raise today.
How do you like that?

509
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,461
Yeah?
Why didn't you say so during dinner?

510
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,048
We could've used the conversation.
Put them down. Come here.

511
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:42,926
- How much you get?
- It's gonna be $4.00.

512
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,386
It was... It was $2.50, right?

513
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,180
But he raised the raise

514
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,766
when he found out
I wasn't so, you know, disappointed.

515
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,351
- $4.00?
- Yeah.

516
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:54,562
Shit. You know what $4.00 buys today?

517
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,940
It don't even buy $3.00.

518
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:59,817
I don't see nobody giving you a raise
down at Unemployment.

519
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:02,362
$4.00. Shit.

520
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,156
I knew you'd piss on it.
Go on, just piss on it, right?

521
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,825
A raise says, like, you're good,
you know what I mean?

522
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,161
You know how many times somebody
told me I was good in my life?

523
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,413
Two. Two. Twice. Two fucking times,

524
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:15,416
this raise today and dancing,
dancing at the disco.

525
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,211
You sure as fuck never did. Asshole.

526
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,132
$4.00. Shit.

527
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:44,904
Why ain't you waiting inside?

528
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,198
Well, I wanted to watch you
come down the street.

529
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,908
I like the way you walk.

530
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,827
Shit.

531
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,747
Tony, listen, I've been thinking.

532
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,500
Maybe I'll make it with you.

533
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,795
That's what you call thinking, huh?
Jesus Christ.

534
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:04,007
You know what? You're too much,
Annette. You know that?

535
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,135
I mean, you say we're gonna make it,
that means we're gonna make it, right?

536
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,053
I mean, like,
I got no say in this at all, right?

537
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,555
It's time we went out.

538
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,140
You told me you wanted to do it.

539
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:14,058
You told me
how horny a man gets when he's 19,

540
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,935
how much his balls ache
morning, noon and night,

541
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,980
six days a week, sometimes seven,
if he don't get it.

542
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:21,482
How do you remember those things?

543
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:23,901
Look, Annette, we're gonna be
spending a lot of time together,

544
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,321
you know, rehearsing,
practicing, whatnot.

545
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,532
If we was balling,
it would be like we was going together.

546
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,784
And I won't be going with you.

547
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:34,454
Look, I mean, what are you, anyway?
You a nice girl or you a cunt?

548
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:36,664
I don't know. Both?

549
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,542
You can't be both. I mean, that's a thing
a girl's gotta decide early on.

550
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,628
You gotta decide whether
you're gonna be a nice girl or a cunt.

551
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,839
- How you doing, Pete?
- Hey, Tony, my man.

552
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,258
- You got a studio free or what?
- Yeah, two is free.

553
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:51,596
- Good. Hey, how you doing?
- Steady at 65%.

554
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:56,059
Pete. He's always busting my onions.

555
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:59,228
I send him a lot of customers, you know.
He gives me free studio time when...

556
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:00,813
What did he mean, 65%?

557
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:04,776
Oh, that... Oh, that means that he...

558
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:09,155
He scores with 65% of the chicks
that come in here.

559
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,038
And one, two, three, two, two, three.

560
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:18,998
One, two, one, two, three.

561
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,084
One, two, three. Good.
Two, two, three. Good.

562
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,044
One, two, one, two, three.

563
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,629
Good, that's it.

564
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:26,214
Now do it again.

565
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:38,101
That's it, good. All right. All right. Again.

566
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,936
Tony, it's only dancing. Jesus.

567
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,313
Only dancing? Forget it, Annette.

568
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,732
If you're not gonna take this seriously,
I don't wanna dance.

569
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:46,317
- Don't get mad.
- "Don't get mad."

570
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:47,693
Jesus.

571
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:54,492
Look, I think we done
enough dancing for today.

572
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:57,161
So, why don't we... Why don't we
dance Wednesday, all right?

573
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:58,704
Yeah. Sure.

574
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:01,666
- All right. Here.
- You walking home now?

575
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:05,253
No. I'm gonna stick around
and talk to Peter a little bit,

576
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:08,256
and, you know,
work on some stuff myself.

577
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,633
- I'll see you later, all right?
- Yeah.

578
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,510
You was good today.

579
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,956
Hi. How you doing?

580
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:49,046
Hey, you know, you're
a very good dancer, you know that?

581
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:53,134
I would like to meet you.

582
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:57,763
Look, would you...
Would you mind just going away, okay?

583
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,891
- What?
- Don't be hurt, but I...

584
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:01,100
Don't be hurt?

585
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:03,811
Yeah, I wanna be by myself now,
you know?

586
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,313
Listen, I seen you at 2001
the other night.

587
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,023
Yeah, so? So?

588
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:09,734
Well, I mean, you was looking at me
and I was looking at you, remember?

589
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:12,403
Well, what is this? I look at a guy
longer than a millionth of a second,

590
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:15,531
already, he gets delusions of grandeur.

591
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:18,075
You know what you are?
I'm gonna tell you what you are.

592
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,078
I bet it begins with a "C," Mr. P.

593
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:24,499
Oh, fine. Fine. That's...

594
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:27,418
I know the type. I know the type. Fine.

595
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,638
What you doing up so late?

596
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:42,558
What is this? I walk in,
you don't got no criticism of me?

597
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:46,771
- Your brother's upstairs.
- You're kidding.

598
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,731
- Yo, Frankie!
- Tony.

599
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,192
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hiya, kid.

600
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:55,613
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

601
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,990
Yeah. You look good.

602
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:01,035
No, I don't. You do. You look wonderful.

603
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:03,746
- You checking out my trophy?
- Oh, yeah. That's you, huh?

604
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,706
- Yeah.
- "First prize."

605
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,334
Looks just like you.

606
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:09,961
Hey, what did you say
to them downstairs?

607
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,879
They look crazy,
they look like zombies, like...

608
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:14,048
Like somebody died or something.

609
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,175
I think they're in shock, Tony.

610
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:19,845
In shock?
Well, how come they're in shock?

611
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,223
I'm leaving the church, Tony.

612
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,810
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Leaving the church.

613
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:30,314
- Tell me another one.
- I'm leaving the priesthood.

614
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:34,443
Oh, come on, Frank.
Don't fool around like that.

615
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:36,362
Do you think I'm losing my hair?

616
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:39,407
It looks awful thin
right over here and here.

617
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,786
Are you serious?

618
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,705
Can I borrow some of your clothes
until I buy some?

619
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:48,249
I don't want to wear the uniform.

620
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,836
I'm sorry, Frank. I really am. I'm sorry.

621
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,921
What are you sorry about?

622
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:56,924
You got fired, huh?

623
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:58,968
I didn't get fired. I quit.

624
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,261
You quit?

625
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:03,055
Yeah, you can do those things,
you know.

626
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:15,651
What did Mom say?
What did she say about it?

627
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:20,323
She said, "Dear Lord, what am I
gonna tell Theresa and Marie?"

628
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:23,951
- And Dad? What did he say about it?
- They're ashamed, the both of them.

629
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:26,037
They're ashamed, right?

630
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:29,749
You ashamed of me, Tony?

631
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,752
Yeah, you are.

632
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:37,423
- They didn't ask why or nothing?
- No.

633
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:41,302
I think they're afraid to.
Like, I might say, "celibacy."

634
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:45,973
But...

635
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:56,275
You gonna sleep here tonight?
You wanna sleep in my room?

636
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:59,278
- Yeah, I thought I would.
- All right, you can...

637
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:01,739
I'll get your blankets for you.

638
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:24,095
Frank, how come you left? Really?

639
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,352
It's not easy to explain, Anthony.
A lot of things.

640
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,814
One day, you look at a crucifix,

641
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:39,402
and all you see
is a man dying on a cross.

642
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:43,698
But that's only a backdrop
to something else.

643
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,911
Mama and Papa,
their dreams of pious glory.

644
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:52,456
They turn you
into what they wish at a time...

645
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:57,753
You can't defend yourself
against their fantasies.

646
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:02,049
All I ever really had any belief in
was their image of me as a priest.

647
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,551
That's all.

648
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:15,604
Guess we're gonna have to take
your picture down from the mantle.

649
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,986
Know what's weird?

650
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:25,239
Like, I always felt like
I was the shit of the family,

651
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,699
and you was always, like, perfect.

652
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:31,162
Now that I'm the disgrace to the family,
I'm not so perfect anymore.

653
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,540
So, maybe you're not shit anymore.

654
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:40,796
Yeah, maybe if you ain't so good,
I ain't so bad, you know?

655
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:42,673
Yeah.

656
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,926
Ha.

657
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:53,976
- Give me the groceries, motherfucker.
- Hey, come on.

658
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,436
- Hey, don't take my groceries, man.
- I'm hungry.

659
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,937
- I'm hungry, Gus.
- Hey, what are you doing?

660
00:39:57,021 --> 00:39:59,440
Hey, come on! Hey, come on!
Hey, don't eat the apple!

661
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:01,442
- Give me... Give me it back.
- Here.

662
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,694
Jesus.
What's the matter with you anyway?

663
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:06,071
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

664
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,032
My brother, he quit the Church.
You believe that?

665
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,492
- Yeah?
- I feel...

666
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,660
I feel wild. I got all this energy.
I can't believe it.

667
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:12,828
Yeah?

668
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:14,330
Hey, listen, I'll call you later tonight,
all right?

669
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:15,748
Yeah, we'll do... Hey!

670
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:18,375
- See you later, Gus.
- I'll see you.

671
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:21,629
Come on, honey, higher with the arms.

672
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:23,798
Yeah, that's it.

673
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:25,883
Yeah, do it to me!

674
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,179
Pete, she come in?

675
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,431
I told you on the phone,
she comes in on Tuesday.

676
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:35,351
- I know. So, did she come in or what?
- And what is it today, huh?

677
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,228
- It's Tuesday.
- Yeah.

678
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:43,067
Hey, Ton! Watch it, man.
That one's practicing to be a bitch.

679
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,860
Come on, people!

680
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:50,574
Good, yeah. Oh, that's good.
You're doing great. Yeah.

681
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,192
Hello, Stephanie Mangano.

682
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:27,611
I'm Tony Manero.

683
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:30,656
We both got the same last initials.
How do you like that?

684
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,867
Wow. We get married,
I don't have to change the monogram

685
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,827
on my luggage, huh?

686
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,539
Somebody told me
you was practicing to be a bitch.

687
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:39,874
Is that true?

688
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,425
All right, Mr. Manero.
What do you want to ask me?

689
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:51,552
I would like to take you out to coffee.
Would that be good?

690
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,637
That's it, huh?
You want me to have coffee with you?

691
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:55,598
I think you're a very good dancer.

692
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:59,351
You know that 2001 Odyssey,

693
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:01,979
they got a dance contest now.

694
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:05,566
And I think that we could be
a dynamite team together.

695
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,447
- How old are you, huh?
- I'm 20.

696
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:17,661
Well, I'm 19 at the moment,
but I'll be 20 very shortly.

697
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:19,204
What I think is this.

698
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:21,248
There's a world of difference
between us, you know?

699
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:24,084
Not just chronologically,
but emotionally,

700
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,545
culturally, physically, every which way.

701
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:28,339
And this world would get much bigger

702
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:31,175
and much worse
with every passing week.

703
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:33,594
What kind of shit is that?

704
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,263
- Coffee, not sex.
- Just coffee, huh?

705
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,183
See, look, where I work,
the people are very remarkable.

706
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:41,769
They're not like these here
Bay Ridge people at all.

707
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:43,854
You mean snobs
instead of slobs, right?

708
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:45,856
- What?
- Nothing.

709
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,025
Hey, you know, Bay Ridge
ain't the worst part of Brooklyn.

710
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,193
You know what I'm talking?

711
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:50,945
I mean, you know,
it ain't like a hellhole or nothing.

712
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:53,781
Yeah, well, it ain't Manhattan.
It isn't Manhattan.

713
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:55,699
You got no idea how it changes,
you know.

714
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:57,201
Just right over there,
right across the river,

715
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:59,453
everything is different,
completely different.

716
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:01,038
It's beautiful, just beautiful.

717
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:03,958
The people are beautiful,
offices are beautiful.

718
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,794
The secretaries, you know,
they all shop at Bonwit Teller.

719
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:07,962
Oh, yeah?

720
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:09,880
And, like, the lunch hours
are beautiful, too.

721
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:13,300
Like, you know, they'll give you,
like, two hours for lunch

722
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,135
- to do something that's related.
- Oh, yeah?

723
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:18,055
Like we've seen
Zeffirelli's <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

724
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:22,059
Over here. <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> yeah?
I read that in high school.

725
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:25,145
That's... That's Shakespeare, right?

726
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:28,232
No, it's Zeffirelli,
the director of the movie.

727
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:31,402
- You know, the movie? Film.
- Yeah.

728
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,904
You know what?
What I never understood

729
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:35,823
about that <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

730
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:39,243
I never understood why Romeo,
he took the poison so quick, you know?

731
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,996
I feel like he could have waited
or something.

732
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:45,124
Well, that's the way
they took the poison in those days.

733
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:49,420
Hey, you gonna eat?
Here, look at a menu.

734
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:52,423
No, no. I'll just have tea.
Tea with lemon.

735
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,011
I started drinking tea recently, you know.
It's really a lot more refined.

736
00:43:57,136 --> 00:43:58,846
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

737
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:00,431
All those women executives
in my office,

738
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:02,016
they all drink tea with lemon.

739
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,602
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. And you notice that I do, too.

740
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:09,023
- I like coffee, you know? I drink coffee.
- Yeah.

741
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:16,196
You see, like, I've only been
at this agency a really short time,

742
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:20,951
but already I'm functioning in a, kind of,
public relations capacity, you know.

743
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:23,704
I fill in for the agents
when they're elsewhere.

744
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:26,206
Like, this week, you know, I had...

745
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:29,209
I had business lunches
with Eric Clapton at La Cote Basque

746
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:32,379
- and Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal.
- Oh, far out.

747
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:35,883
Yeah. You heard of
those restaurants, huh?

748
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:39,970
No, I don't know
those exact restaurants.

749
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:41,221
I know the type.

750
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,474
Yeah, but you must have heard
of the artists.

751
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:46,477
No, I... Not... I don't know... You know.

752
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,978
Not really.

753
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,647
So what did you say "far out" for, huh?

754
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:53,233
'Cause it sounded, like, far out.
Wasn't it? I mean...

755
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:56,403
- Well, yeah.
- We'd like a lemon with some tea now.

756
00:44:56,528 --> 00:45:00,032
And I'd like a cheeseburger
and some coffee.

757
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,082
Hey, you know who came
in the office the other day?

758
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:10,250
- Who?
- Laurence Olivier.

759
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:11,502
Who's that?

760
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:14,838
Who's Laurence Olivier?
You don't know who he is?

761
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:16,256
Laurence Olivier, man!

762
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,509
He's the greatest actor
in the whole world.

763
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,677
Oh, come on, you know who he is.

764
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:21,929
He's the English actor,

765
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:25,015
the one on television who does
all those Polaroid commercials.

766
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:27,351
You know, Laurence Olivier.

767
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:30,187
- Oh, him. Oh, he's good. He is good.
- Yeah.

768
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,022
Well, anyway,
he comes in the office, right?

769
00:45:32,106 --> 00:45:33,690
So, I just do a few errands for him.

770
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,943
So, he goes around,
he tells everybody in the entire office,

771
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:37,277
he says I'm the brightest,

772
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:40,948
I'm the most vivacious thing
in the entire office he's seen in years.

773
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:42,449
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

774
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:47,204
Do you think that you could get, like,
a camera from him at a discount?

775
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,957
I didn't ask him about a camera.

776
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,126
'Cause you got one already, right,
you sly fox, you.

777
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,211
Hey, look, are you enjoying
all this stuff I'm telling you?

778
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:55,629
Sure. I think it's good.

779
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:58,132
Well, I just think maybe you can't handle
hearing about a kind of life

780
00:45:58,257 --> 00:46:01,301
that is so completely different
than yours.

781
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:04,805
- You mean "better," don't you?
- Yes, I mean better. Sure, it's better.

782
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,640
Can I have some ketchup, please?

783
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:08,559
I mean, I'm out of this scene
almost completely,

784
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:10,727
you know, this Bay Ridge scene.
I'm moving into Manhattan.

785
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:13,230
I'm getting my own apartment.

786
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:14,815
I'm changing.

787
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,234
I'm really changing as a person,
and I'm growing.

788
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:19,820
You know what I mean? Nobody has
any idea how much I'm growing.

789
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,446
Why don't you go on a diet?

790
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:30,581
Okay, listen. I like you.
We could dance together.

791
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:33,167
That's it. We could just dance together
and nothing more.

792
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:35,419
Nothing personal.
I don't want you coming on to me.

793
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:36,587
Why not?

794
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,173
Because I don't date guys
like you anymore, for one thing.

795
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:41,425
You're too young,
you haven't got any class, and, yeah,

796
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:44,094
I'm sick of jerk-off guys
ain't got their shit together!

797
00:46:44,178 --> 00:46:46,847
Oh, come on.
It's easy to get your shit together.

798
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,350
All you need is a salad bowl
and a potato masher.

799
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:52,936
Get your shit together.

800
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,606
- Would you like to know what I do?
- It's not necessary.

801
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:57,441
I'll tell you what I do.

802
00:46:57,524 --> 00:47:00,694
I work in a paint store,
and I got a raise this week.

803
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,613
Right. You work in a paint store, right?

804
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:04,948
You probably live with your family,
you hang out with your buddies,

805
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:07,951
and on Saturday night you go,
you blow it all off at 2001, right?

806
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:10,704
- That's right.
- You're a cliché.

807
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:13,665
You're nowhere,
on your way to no place.

808
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:19,796
What do you got?
A fucking stairway to the stars or what?

809
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,131
- Yeah, maybe.
- Yeah.

810
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:22,799
I'm taking a course, nights,
at the new school.

811
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,551
Next semester, I'm gonna take two.

812
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:26,386
Now, you, you probably
didn't get no college, did you?

813
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,721
No, I did not.

814
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,640
Well, did you ever think
about going to college?

815
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:31,058
- No.
- Not ever?

816
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:32,976
- No. Did you?
- Well, not back then, no...

817
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,978
Then why the fuck
are you bugging me about it for?

818
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,147
Well, why not? Why didn't
you ever want to go to college?

819
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:39,733
- Oh, just fuck off, will you? I did not.
- No, really. Tell me. Why not?

820
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:42,027
Oh, Jesus Christ! I didn't!

821
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,493
The thing is
the high I get at 2001 is just dancing,

822
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:52,913
it's not being the best
or nothing like that.

823
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,499
The only thing is
that I would like to get that high

824
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:58,752
someplace else in my life. You know?

825
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,420
Like where?

826
00:48:00,504 --> 00:48:03,924
I don't know where.
I don't know. Someplace.

827
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,927
You see, dancing, it can't last forever.

828
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:09,596
It's a short-lived kind of thing.

829
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,099
But I'm getting older, you know.

830
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:14,768
You know, I feel like...

831
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:16,770
I feel like, you know,
so what, I'm getting older.

832
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:19,439
Does that mean, like, I can't feel
that way about nothing left in my life?

833
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:21,358
You know? Is that it?

834
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:24,027
Listen, we gotta split here.

835
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:26,446
No, I'll walk you the rest of the way.

836
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:30,200
No, I'll meet you at the dance studio,
just like we said, okay?

837
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:31,952
Stephanie, I can walk you home.

838
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:34,955
Look, nothing personal, right?

839
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,791
Oh, come on, Stephanie. I can walk you.

840
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:42,796
Oh, Jesus Christ! You know?

841
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:51,972
I don't know where he is.

842
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,974
- Did you call him?
- No.

843
00:48:58,645 --> 00:49:00,314
What's the matter? What's going on?

844
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:03,233
It's Gus, man. He's in the hospital.
The spics got him.

845
00:49:03,317 --> 00:49:04,985
- Spanish Barons?
- Barracudas.

846
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,487
- Hey, that's my fucking car!
- Forget the car!

847
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:09,489
- Save it for the spics.
- Just give me the keys.

848
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:12,576
- You're asking for it.
- I can't believe it. I just saw him.

849
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:15,329
He could have run, you know?
But he hung tight. That's Gus.

850
00:49:15,454 --> 00:49:17,497
Don't worry about it.
Okay? All right?

851
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,333
I got in the hospital to see him.

852
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:22,919
He got a broken nose, busted ribs,
a broken leg and four teeth knocked out.

853
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:24,087
Shit.

854
00:49:24,171 --> 00:49:26,923
I mean, all he was doing was walking
along the street carrying his groceries,

855
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,675
and three of them
do a shove number on him.

856
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,178
They spill his fucking groceries
into the street.

857
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:34,264
So, he says under his breath,
"grease balls, spic dicks,"

858
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:35,682
and they laid into him.

859
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:49,780
All right. Go check it out.

860
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,549
Nobody in there, man.

861
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,222
All right, all right.
This is what we're gonna do.

862
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:16,390
We're just gonna cruise around

863
00:50:16,515 --> 00:50:18,308
until there's enough of them
that we can handle.

864
00:50:18,392 --> 00:50:20,560
Yeah, yeah, we'll just pick
off a couple on the street.

865
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:22,479
- That's pussy, man!
- Fuck, man. Fuck.

866
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:25,732
- You're fucked up!
- I'm sorry, guys.

867
00:50:25,816 --> 00:50:28,819
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

868
00:50:28,902 --> 00:50:30,195
You're sorry.

869
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:33,156
Oh, forget it. We'll get them tomorrow.

870
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,663
All right, dream good. Jerk off better.

871
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:44,501
Tony, I'm getting married.

872
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:46,753
Will you cut it with that shit?

873
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:49,506
No, listen.
I just wanted to let you know, all right?

874
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:51,007
All right. Look. If you get married,

875
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:52,843
we'll all go with you
on your honeymoon, all right?

876
00:50:52,926 --> 00:50:56,263
- You will? Okay.
- Okay, good. Take it easy.

877
00:50:56,388 --> 00:50:58,849
Come on, Bobby. Get in the car.

878
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,934
Hey.

879
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:03,687
Hey, you know,
we should go to the hospital tomorrow.

880
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,439
You know what I'm talking?

881
00:51:05,564 --> 00:51:09,025
And you, cool off! You know?

882
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,069
All right. Good night.

883
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:36,803
Tony, what did you say
to Father Frank, Jr.?

884
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:39,139
- What?
- What did you say? What did you do?

885
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:40,557
Yeah, what did you say?

886
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,644
- What are you talking about?
- You must have said something to him.

887
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:46,271
You sleep in the same room.
You talk to him.

888
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,440
The next night he stays out all night,
he don't come back.

889
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:51,443
- I said nothing to him.
- A priest staying out all night.

890
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:52,944
A priest is not a priest no more,

891
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:55,197
and he's grown up,
so he can do what he wants.

892
00:51:55,322 --> 00:51:57,115
Something you said to him.

893
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,659
Oh, yeah? You try and blame me
now he ain't a priest no more?

894
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,453
You been writing to him.

895
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:04,706
I don't believe this.
You're trying to hang this on me?

896
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:08,793
Forget it, all right?
He called. He called. He called.

897
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:11,963
In a couple of days
he's gonna see he's wrong.

898
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:14,966
He's going through, like,
a trial of the soul, you know?

899
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,718
He's going back to the church.
He's going back.

900
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,345
No, he won't.
He's not going back to the church.

901
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,804
Yes, he is.
He's going back to the church!

902
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:21,681
I'm telling you, he's going back!

903
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:24,851
You know what?
You don't got a priest no more!

904
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,061
And you got no saint!

905
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:28,230
You got nothing
but three shit children now!

906
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:30,315
Good. Good.

907
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:33,652
No.

908
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:41,993
I'm sorry, Mom.

909
00:52:44,204 --> 00:52:45,664
I just...

910
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,626
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.
I'll never say that.

911
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:52,170
I love you, Mom. I really do.

912
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:54,923
Go on. Get out of here.

913
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,771
- How you doing, Annette?
- Okay.

914
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,231
- That's good.
- Yeah.

915
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:15,735
Hey, listen, look, Annette.
I gotta tell you something, all right?

916
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,822
It's very hard to tell you this, but...

917
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:21,950
I changed my mind
about us dancing together.

918
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:23,952
I got another partner.

919
00:53:27,581 --> 00:53:30,125
Look, it's professional.
You know what I mean? It's like...

920
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:33,420
Things like this happen
when it's professional.

921
00:53:33,962 --> 00:53:37,090
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My fucking mother, now you.

922
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,509
Why do you hate me so much?

923
00:53:39,593 --> 00:53:42,262
All I ever did to you was like you.

924
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:44,764
Give me a break, huh?

925
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:01,156
Hi.

926
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:02,782
You're late.

927
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,410
Five minutes. That's not late.

928
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:06,953
How long you been here?

929
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:09,414
I don't know.
Six, seven, something like that.

930
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:11,875
Pete said you been here 15.

931
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:14,085
Well, who's he?

932
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:17,756
Hey, I got some records over here.
I don't know if you like them or not.

933
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,092
- You like these guys?
- Yeah, yeah. Super.

934
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:25,472
Do you do the New York hustle,
the Latin hustle, what?

935
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:28,266
- New York, Latin, I do it all.
- Okay.

936
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:43,323
<i>Girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day</i>

937
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:48,119
<i>I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away</i>

938
00:54:48,203 --> 00:54:52,415
<i>Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do</i>

939
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:56,920
<i>You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you</i>

940
00:54:57,003 --> 00:54:58,755
Follow me this time.

941
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:02,133
<i>I found my paradise</i>

942
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:05,679
<i>My only chance for happiness</i>

943
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:08,848
<i>And if I lose you now
I think I would die</i>

944
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,434
Yeah, that's really nice.
What'd you do, make that up?

945
00:55:11,518 --> 00:55:14,396
Yeah. Yeah. No, I saw it on TV first.

946
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:16,439
Then I made it up.

947
00:55:16,523 --> 00:55:18,608
Hey, you know what? I know this one.
What I do is...

948
00:55:18,692 --> 00:55:21,820
Wait a minute. This is simple.
Let me just check something out.

949
00:55:22,696 --> 00:55:25,573
<i>More than a woman</i>

950
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:31,621
<i>More than a woman to me
Baby</i>

951
00:55:31,705 --> 00:55:33,832
<i>More than a woman</i>

952
00:55:36,209 --> 00:55:39,254
- Come on. Come on.
- What you doing?

953
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:48,054
Okay, stay right there.

954
00:55:57,689 --> 00:55:59,149
Now we can dance.

955
00:55:59,232 --> 00:56:00,900
Let me show you the step, okay?

956
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,153
The Latin one I was
gonna show you, okay?

957
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:06,614
Now, take your hand like this,
and count one, two, three.

958
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,702
Two, two, three.
Three, two, three, kick, two, three.

959
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:13,204
- Okay, I got that.
- Okay?

960
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:15,081
- Looks good.
- All right.

961
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:21,129
<i>More than a woman to me
Baby</i>

962
00:56:21,713 --> 00:56:23,548
- That's good. I like that.
- Yeah.

963
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:25,925
- Do you know the tango hustle?
- Yeah, yeah.

964
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,927
Okay, let's try that.

965
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:35,643
<i>More than a woman</i>

966
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:44,110
<i>There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me</i>

967
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:47,739
<i>And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself</i>

968
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:52,327
<i>Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people then</i>

969
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:54,621
<i>I know that in a thousand years</i>

970
00:56:57,499 --> 00:57:02,003
<i>This is the only way that we should fly</i>

971
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:06,132
<i>This is the only way to go</i>

972
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:10,261
<i>And if I lose you
I know I would die</i>

973
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:15,225
<i>Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine</i>

974
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:19,854
<i>We can take forever
Just a minute at a time</i>

975
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:22,398
<i>Minute at a time</i>

976
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:26,778
<i>More than a woman
More than a woman</i>

977
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,322
<i>More than a woman to me</i>

978
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,533
<i>Yes, you are, baby</i>

979
00:57:31,658 --> 00:57:35,954
<i>More than a woman
More than a woman</i>

980
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:40,208
<i>More than a woman to me</i>

981
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:44,128
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yeah.

982
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:47,048
No, no. Look, I really gotta go home.

983
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:52,345
You know something?
I like you when you're like this.

984
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:57,141
When you're quiet and you ain't laying
all that shit on me and everything.

985
00:57:57,517 --> 00:57:58,852
Oh, yeah? Well, as a matter of fact,

986
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:01,187
guess who I had lunch with today?
Paul Anka.

987
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:02,897
I had to open my big mouth, right?

988
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:05,692
It was very interesting.
Very interesting. Very interesting.

989
00:58:05,817 --> 00:58:07,944
Very, very intelligent fellow.

990
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:10,738
You cream over that word,
"interesting," don't you?

991
00:58:10,864 --> 00:58:13,324
- Well, what's wrong with "interesting"?
- I don't know, something.

992
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:14,576
You know, I want to tell you something.

993
00:58:14,701 --> 00:58:17,704
I've never told you this before,
but I think you're full of shit.

994
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:20,415
- Oh, you do, do you, huh?
- Yeah, except I'm not sure.

995
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,209
I'm not sure how much is just shit
and how much is bullshit.

996
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:27,255
Well, listen, when you figure it out,
just let me know, all right?

997
00:58:29,257 --> 00:58:31,718
We should really practice
a couple more times.

998
00:58:31,843 --> 00:58:33,970
Maybe go to 2001 with a crowd.

999
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:36,222
How about Saturday?
Would that be good?

1000
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:37,682
Maybe.

1001
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:41,853
Stephanie, I wanna
ask you something, all right?

1002
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:44,898
I don't know how to say this.

1003
00:58:47,734 --> 00:58:51,112
Do you think that I am
either interesting or intelligent?

1004
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:55,533
Interesting? Yeah. Yeah.

1005
00:58:55,617 --> 00:58:57,243
Intelligent?

1006
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,080
I don't know. Maybe.

1007
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:04,000
I don't know. I gotta know you better.
You know what I mean?

1008
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,960
You got a way of putting things together,
you know?

1009
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:07,712
Seeing things a certain way.

1010
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:10,089
Interesting? Yeah, yeah.

1011
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:14,135
Intelligent? Yeah, maybe.
Maybe intelligent.

1012
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,095
Well, what do you know?

1013
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:18,806
All right.

1014
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:21,726
Hey, Stephanie,
how come we never talk

1015
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:23,269
about how we feel when we're dancing?

1016
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:26,397
- How come we never talk about that?
- Good night and thanks.

1017
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:28,733
No, maybe I could walk you
the rest of the way.

1018
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:30,777
- Let me do that.
- Nope.

1019
00:59:33,488 --> 00:59:36,699
You shouldn't have asked.
You should have just done it.

1020
00:59:36,783 --> 00:59:38,785
Oh, hot stuff, Jesus.

1021
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:48,211
<i>If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby</i>

1022
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,797
<i>If I can't have you</i>

1023
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:57,345
<i>If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby</i>

1024
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:00,348
<i>If I can't have you</i>

1025
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:06,062
<i>If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby</i>

1026
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:08,648
<i>If I can't have you</i>

1027
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:24,539
- Hey, what's happening, Tony?
- Bob, what's up? My brother, Frank.

1028
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:26,457
Hey, how you doing? Double J.

1029
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:32,839
<i>Don't know why
I'm surviving every lonely day</i>

1030
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:35,800
<i>When there's got to be</i>

1031
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,802
Hey, how you doing?

1032
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:39,595
<i>My life would end</i>

1033
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:42,223
- Come on up to the table over there.
- Oh, okay.

1034
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:49,397
<i>My tears of love are a waste of time</i>

1035
01:00:49,522 --> 01:00:55,403
<i>If I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through</i>

1036
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:59,532
<i>Go crazy is what I will do</i>

1037
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:01,367
You guys have the Moses effect.

1038
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:04,412
You arrive
and the crowd parts like the Red Sea.

1039
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:06,164
They know we're the faces, that's all.

1040
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:09,459
- How do you like it, Father?
- What father? I look like your father?

1041
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:13,046
Please don't call me that.
I never could stand that.

1042
01:01:13,171 --> 01:01:15,923
But, yeah, I think the place is,
you know, energizing.

1043
01:01:16,049 --> 01:01:18,634
- It's all right, huh?
- Great.

1044
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:19,886
Good place.

1045
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:27,351
<i>Burn, baby, burn
Disco inferno</i>

1046
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:29,020
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

1047
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:31,022
- Tony.
- Hey.

1048
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:32,690
Hey.

1049
01:01:33,024 --> 01:01:36,402
Are you as good in bed
as you are on that dance floor?

1050
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,114
Well, are you?

1051
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:43,242
Are you as good in bed
as you are on the dance floor?

1052
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:46,579
- Hey, he never made it in a bed.
- Watch this.

1053
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:49,624
This ain't my regular partner,
but you'll see.

1054
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:54,962
Ton, what are you gonna have to drink?
We'll get you something, huh?

1055
01:01:55,088 --> 01:01:57,632
- Seven and Seven.
- Seven and Seven.

1056
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:00,885
<i>When my spark gets hot</i>

1057
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:04,722

<i>When my spark gets hot</i>

1059
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:17,235
So, when's Connie
gonna get her answer, huh?

1060
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:20,780
- You know, Connie.
- Yeah.

1061
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:23,324
If you're as good in bed
as you are on the dance floor,

1062
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:26,160
I'll bet you're one lousy fuck.

1063
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:29,664
So, how come they always send me
flowers the next day, huh?

1064
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:31,916
You know, some guys don't know
a lousy fuck when they got one.

1065
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:34,585
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah?

1066
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:36,712
Maybe they thought you was dead.

1067
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:39,298
Father, wanna hear something? Listen.

1068
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:42,343
I got a girlfriend of mine, you know.
She's such a good Catholic, Father.

1069
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:45,680
She tells me she loves the taste
of communion wafers.

1070
01:02:48,057 --> 01:02:49,892
Hey, Mr. Manero,
could I talk to you for a sec?

1071
01:02:49,976 --> 01:02:51,227
- Hey, what's he doing?
- Frank.

1072
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:52,562
Frank, yeah,
Frank, yeah. Listen...

1073
01:02:54,564 --> 01:02:56,315
Oh, forget this.

1074
01:02:57,233 --> 01:03:00,653
Look out. Give the kid some room.
He's taking over again.

1075
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:01,904
- All right!
- All right!

1076
01:03:01,988 --> 01:03:03,197
Go, go!

1082
01:03:18,087 --> 01:03:20,506
- Okay, babe.
- There he goes.

1083
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:23,176

01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:25,256
- He's the best.
- Hey, man, he's great. He's great.

Listen, can I talk to you
for a second, Father?

1114
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:36,642
Yes, but call me Frank.

1115
01:05:36,726 --> 01:05:40,479
Frank? Frank, listen. Come here.
You wanna hear something? Listen.

1116
01:05:40,563 --> 01:05:43,232
I got... My girlfriend, you know...
Can I tell you something?

1117
01:05:43,316 --> 01:05:44,734
- Yeah.
- Come here for a sec.

1118
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:47,320
Listen, Frank. Wanna hear something?

1119
01:05:47,403 --> 01:05:50,406
I got a lot of ideas. You see, like,
I was reading up about the Pope.

1120
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:52,199
- Hey, Father?
- Yeah, sure. Frank, Frank.

1121
01:05:52,325 --> 01:05:54,160
Frank. Yeah, Frank. Yeah, Frank.

1122
01:05:54,243 --> 01:05:58,289
Okay, Frank. Listen, Frank,
I got a girlfriend, you know?

1123
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:00,124
She's Pauline.
Her name's Pauline. And...

1124
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:02,543
Yeah. What do you mean, you got her...

1125
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:04,462
Did you get her pregnant?

1126
01:06:04,545 --> 01:06:07,006
Yes, I did. Yes. Yes, I did.

1127
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:09,967
She loves the taste
of communion wafers.

1128
01:06:10,051 --> 01:06:13,137
Well, I got a lot of ideas, you know,
swimming around in my head.

1129
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,222
And I was reading a lot of stuff lately.

1130
01:06:15,348 --> 01:06:19,310
I heard, like, the Pope, he gives special,

1131
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:21,270
- you know...
- Dispensation.

1132
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:25,608
Yeah. Do you think the Pope
could give Pauline an abortion?

1133
01:06:25,691 --> 01:06:28,152
You mean give you
a dispensation for an abortion?

1134
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:30,863
Yeah, you think you could do this?

1135
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:33,282
I don't think so, Bobby.

1136
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:35,701
Well, maybe, you know,
maybe you could do it for me.

1137
01:06:35,785 --> 01:06:38,871
- Maybe?
- I'm sorry, Bobby. I don't think so.

1138
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:40,206
I was just thinking.

1139
01:06:40,289 --> 01:06:42,249
Have you talked to your priest about it?

1140
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:45,211
Yeah, I talk to everybody about it.

1141
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:47,671
I talked to a lot of people.
A lot of people. A lot of people.

1142
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:50,341
All right, thank you.
Thanks a lot. All right?

1143
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:53,469
You play, you pay. It's funny, huh?

01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:08,776
- No?
- I know Stephanie.

1149
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:11,445
- Did she come in yet?
- No, she didn't get in yet.

1150
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:13,322
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

- Yeah.

1157
01:07:27,837 --> 01:07:31,173
No, no, stay a little longer, Frank.
The night's just beginning.

1158
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:33,926
Yeah, I know,
but it's not my scene, you know?

1159
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:36,429
Come on. You didn't expect me
to stay the whole night, did you?

1160
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:38,139
No, no. I didn't...

1161
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:41,725
Yes, I thought maybe
you'd stay a little longer.

1162
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:44,603
- No, it's not your scene. Of course not.
- I'm sorry, Tony.

1163
01:07:44,687 --> 01:07:46,689
Don't worry about it.
It's nothing, you know.

1164
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:48,482
So what, right? Come on.

1165
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,651
I'll walk you to the door.

1166
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:54,780
Hey, you know,
your dancing is really marvelous.

1167
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:57,783
It's exciting. I mean, it's exciting
to watch you out there.

1168
01:07:57,867 --> 01:08:00,494
They can't keep their eyes off of you.

1169
01:08:00,953 --> 01:08:02,371
Look, I got to go now, okay?
I'll see you later.

1170
01:08:02,455 --> 01:08:04,623
All right, well, have a good night.
I'll see you later. All right?

1171
01:08:04,707 --> 01:08:05,958
Yeah, you, too.

1172
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,751
Hey, she come in or what?

1173
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:11,130
Hey, you just asked me,
and I told you she isn't here.

1174
01:08:15,968 --> 01:08:18,804
<i>And I can't wait till I see you again</i>

1175
01:08:18,888 --> 01:08:21,724
- Tony, your brother, is he okay?
- He's fine.

1176
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:24,810
He just had a stomach thing.
I don't know.

1177
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:29,565
<i>I want to put on
My, my, my, my, my boogie shoes</i>

1178
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:33,277
<i>Just to boogie with you
Yeah</i>

1179
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,070
<i>I want to put on</i>

1180
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:36,739
Just the two of them.

1181
01:08:36,822 --> 01:08:38,491
<i>My, my, my, my, my boogie shoes</i>

1182
01:08:38,574 --> 01:08:40,659
<i>Just to boogie with you</i>

1183
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,704
- We could make it now.
- What?

1184
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:46,040
We ain't practicing,
seeing each other like you said,

1185
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:47,333
so we could make it.

1186
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:49,877
Look, Annette, we make it
when I decide, all right?

1187
01:08:50,002 --> 01:08:51,086
No other time.

1188
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,630
- All right.
- When I say so, all right?

1189
01:08:52,713 --> 01:08:54,882
I'll just make it with somebody else.

1190
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:56,884
Who? Who?

1191
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:59,261
Somebody. I don't care. Anybody here.

1192
01:08:59,345 --> 01:09:01,555
- Oh, somebody here?
- Yeah.

1193
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,933
Double J, Joey.

1194
01:09:04,016 --> 01:09:06,060
Oh, the fuck you will.
Hey, look. Hey, Bobby.

1195
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:07,853
Look, we're gonna go out to the car,

1196
01:09:07,937 --> 01:09:11,273
and when I get back,
we'll go to the bridge, all right?

1197
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:16,278
You fixed?

1198
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:18,739
- Huh?
- Hmm?

1199
01:09:18,864 --> 01:09:21,075
- You fixed?
- What do you mean?

1200
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:25,204
- You know, are you on the pill or what?
- No.

1201
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:27,039
No?

1202
01:09:28,374 --> 01:09:31,085
What do you got, the IOU, that thing?

1203
01:09:31,377 --> 01:09:33,295
- Huh?
- No.

1204
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,881
No diaphragm?

1205
01:09:36,549 --> 01:09:38,050
- Nothing?
- It doesn't matter, though.

1206
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:40,594
- You don't got nothing?
- It doesn't matter. Tony, I love you.

1207
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,137
Are you kidding me?

1208
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:44,265
Oh, forget it. Oh, fuck.

1209
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:47,101
Just give me a blowjob.
Ready? Come on.

1210
01:09:51,063 --> 01:09:52,982
- Just a minute.
- Hey, Tony!

1211
01:09:53,065 --> 01:09:56,068
Forget it. Forget it. Just fix yourself up.

1212
01:09:56,485 --> 01:09:58,320
Everything was cool.
Everything was all right.

1213
01:09:58,404 --> 01:10:00,239
You had a good time.

1214
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,587
Annette, cigarette?

1215
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:19,091
Guess not, huh?

1216
01:10:57,504 --> 01:10:59,131
Stupid goofs.

1217
01:11:13,395 --> 01:11:17,232
Hey, Annette, can you dig it?
I knew that you could.

1218
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:28,911
- Joey!
- You're fucked, Double J.

1219
01:11:29,662 --> 01:11:31,121
- Hey, Tony.
- What?

1220
01:11:31,205 --> 01:11:33,540
Come on.
Let's get this selfish motherfucker.

1221
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:35,292
- All right.
- Let's push him off.

1222
01:11:35,376 --> 01:11:38,128
- All right.
- You're going in, you big, fucking hump!

1223
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,093
Come on, Ton. Let's get him.

1224
01:11:46,428 --> 01:11:48,681
Come on. Let's go. Shit.

1225
01:11:49,598 --> 01:11:52,518
Hey, come on, let's get the fucking
show off and throw him the fuck off.

1226
01:11:52,601 --> 01:11:53,936
Hey, Tarzan!

1227
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:02,861
Look out, Double J!

1228
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:07,032
Don't worry about nothing! I'm coming!

1229
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,664
You fuckers!

1230
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:17,292
- Can you dig it? I knew that you could.
- I knew that you could.

1231
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:22,047
You stupid bitch.

1232
01:12:33,642 --> 01:12:36,061
I wish you was staying longer,
you know, Frank?

1233
01:12:36,145 --> 01:12:38,647
Ex-priests don't stay back home.

1234
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:41,442
Listen, everyone's too shocked
and disgraced.

1235
01:12:41,567 --> 01:12:42,693
A family raises a priest,

1236
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:44,194
they think
they've scored points in heaven,

1237
01:12:44,278 --> 01:12:46,530
- and now they're gonna lose them.
- Hey, Frank. How you doing?

1238
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:50,200
Okay. We better get a move on.
I gotta pick some people on the way.

1239
01:12:50,284 --> 01:12:53,370
Okay. Listen, we gotta keep in touch.

1240
01:12:53,454 --> 01:12:55,122
Yeah. You gonna like
this settlement house?

1241
01:12:55,247 --> 01:12:56,373
What do you think?

1242
01:12:56,457 --> 01:12:58,792
- It'll do until I figure out my next move.
- Yeah.

1243
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:00,961
- What about you?
- What about me?

1244
01:13:01,086 --> 01:13:02,963
Are you gonna do something
with your dancing, Tony?

1245
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:04,965
I don't know.
People ask me all the time.

1246
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:08,385
But I don't know, I mean, you know,
I feel like my whole life, right,

1247
01:13:08,469 --> 01:13:11,388
I've been told I'm the no-good
in the family and that...

1248
01:13:11,472 --> 01:13:16,560
Tony, the only way you're gonna survive
is to do what you think is right,

1249
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:19,730
not what they keep trying
to jam you into.

1250
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:23,609
You let them do that and you're
gonna end up nothing but miserable.

1251
01:13:23,692 --> 01:13:24,985
Huh?

1252
01:13:29,114 --> 01:13:31,992
- Hey, have a good trip, all right?
- Yeah.

1253
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:35,621
I left you something in your room.

1254
01:13:35,788 --> 01:13:37,956
- What did you leave me?
- A souvenir.

1255
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:40,459
Money?

1256
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,629
Leave me money.

1257
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:23,669
Hey.

1258
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:26,088
So, what are you standing there for?

1259
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:28,131
How come you wasn't there
Saturday night?

1260
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:30,634
I didn't say I was gonna be there
Saturday night.

1261
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:34,304
- The fuck you didn't.
- I said maybe. Maybe's a maybe.

1262
01:14:34,388 --> 01:14:36,473
I didn't think you'd go
and get upset about it.

1263
01:14:36,557 --> 01:14:39,893
Oh, forget upset. I'm not upset.
It's just that we needed the practice.

1264
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:41,520
I mean, you know,
you should've been there.

1265
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:44,398
All right, right, let's practice then.

1266
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,568
We can't.

1267
01:14:47,693 --> 01:14:50,445
I didn't bring the records 'cause
I didn't think you was gonna be here.

1268
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:53,198
Yeah? So what did you come for, huh?

1269
01:14:56,743 --> 01:15:00,998
- Stugats. You know "stugats"?
- Yeah, I know "stugats."

1270
01:15:01,081 --> 01:15:02,624
All right, we'll use some of this stuff.

1271
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:05,711
"If you're not of a mind to break up..."

1272
01:15:06,962 --> 01:15:08,297
What's up?

1273
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,215
We've been waiting, man.

1274
01:15:10,299 --> 01:15:12,134
Pete said you was practicing, you know.

1275
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:15,053
Hey, Tony, we were cruising
you know who. Looking good.

1276
01:15:15,137 --> 01:15:17,848
Not now. Don't talk about it now.
Talk about it later.

1277
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:21,518
Stephanie, this is Joey,
this is Double J, this is Bobby C.

1278
01:15:21,602 --> 01:15:23,770
- How you doing, Stephanie?
- How do you do?

1279
01:15:23,896 --> 01:15:25,647
- You a dancer?
- Yeah.

1280
01:15:25,731 --> 01:15:27,649
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1281
01:15:27,733 --> 01:15:29,568
What do you wanna eat, huh?

1282
01:15:31,904 --> 01:15:34,406
- I'm gonna change and then...
- All right.

1283
01:15:35,282 --> 01:15:38,410
What maracas. She's got maracas.
She's got nice tits.

1284
01:15:40,412 --> 01:15:42,039
It's like,
I'm gonna be traveling, you know.

1285
01:15:42,122 --> 01:15:44,416
Promotional tours
with authors and performers.

1286
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,627
Of course, I'm gonna hate
to leave Manhattan, even briefly.

1287
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:49,796
There's certain ballets and concerts
I'm just gonna have to miss.

1288
01:15:49,922 --> 01:15:51,715
Tell them about the people
who come into the office.

1289
01:15:51,798 --> 01:15:53,342
That's what they wanna hear.
Tell them that.

1290
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:56,428
Oh, you know who came in today?
This guy, David Bowie.

1291
01:15:56,511 --> 01:15:59,222
- He comes in, has this Astrakhan coat...
- He's a fagot.

1292
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:03,018
- He's a half-fagot, man.
- Hey, relax! Come on. Sit down.

1293
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,937
You mean, he's a bisexual.

1294
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:06,980
Yeah, he swings both ways.
Men and boys.

1295
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:10,192
- What's so funny?
- Oh, yeah?

1296
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:13,654
Well, you know who came in today?
Joe Namath. You know Joe Namath?

1297
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:15,656
He comes in
and he wants some coffee,

1298
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:16,865
so I brought him coffee.

1299
01:16:16,949 --> 01:16:19,117
And then he asked me to sit down,
have some coffee with him.

1300
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:20,327
You had coffee with Joe Namath?

1301
01:16:20,452 --> 01:16:22,704
Yeah, that's right.
We were talking a little bit.

1302
01:16:22,788 --> 01:16:25,624
He wanted to know
what it was like to be 21.

1303
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:28,126
I told him I didn't know
'cause I was just 20.

1304
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:30,754
- Yeah, what else?
- That's all.

1305
01:16:30,837 --> 01:16:31,964
Ain't that enough?

1306
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:34,257
Hey, don't you never chew, Tony?
Don't you never chew?

1307
01:16:34,341 --> 01:16:36,969
Hey, look, when my mother dies,
I'll give you the job, all right?

1308
01:16:37,052 --> 01:16:38,428
You know what's going
down your throat, man?

1309
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:39,888
Big chunks of hamburger, you know.

1310
01:16:39,972 --> 01:16:42,849
Big gobs, like dog food,
dog friskies, dog yummies.

1311
01:16:42,975 --> 01:16:45,852
You know something, Joey?
He's gonna turn into a dog.

1312
01:17:00,993 --> 01:17:03,620
Stephanie, listen,
can I talk to you for a second?

1313
01:17:03,704 --> 01:17:05,288
I was listening
to what you said in there before,

1314
01:17:05,372 --> 01:17:10,127
and you seem to know a lot of people,
and a lot of places and a lot of things.

1315
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,712
I got a friend of mine, you know,

1316
01:17:11,837 --> 01:17:15,382
he's a very good friend of mine
and he got a girl pregnant.

1317
01:17:15,507 --> 01:17:17,718
He got a girl pregnant,
and I wanted to know

1318
01:17:17,843 --> 01:17:19,636
if you had to make a choice

1319
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,264
between getting an abortion
and have to get married to somebody,

1320
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:23,849
what would you do?

1321
01:17:23,932 --> 01:17:26,184
Well, who would I have to marry?

1322
01:17:27,352 --> 01:17:30,605
You'd have to marry me.
You'd have to marry me. Yeah.

1323
01:17:30,689 --> 01:17:33,150
I think I'd get an abortion.
Hey, so long, Tony.

1324
01:17:33,233 --> 01:17:35,444
It's very nice meeting you.

1325
01:17:36,236 --> 01:17:37,612
So, what'd you guys think of her?

1326
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:40,615
Hey, Tony, I liked her.
I thought she was nice. I liked her a lot.

1327
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:42,868
She's a snotty bitch, man.

1328
01:17:43,452 --> 01:17:45,954
She's cool.
You just gotta get to know her, that's all.

1329
01:17:46,038 --> 01:17:48,040
Hey, Ton, did you fuck her, yet?

1330
01:17:48,123 --> 01:17:50,000
- What do you think?
- I don't think so.

1331
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,878
You know, you guys got a lot
of growing up to do, you know that?

1332
01:17:52,961 --> 01:17:55,464
A lot of growing up. You're babies.

1333
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:57,758
Yeah.

1334
01:17:57,883 --> 01:18:01,344
Hey, Mr. Fusco, look,
I need the afternoon off.

1335
01:18:01,428 --> 01:18:04,264
Sam's out. Harold's sick.
Here, take these.

1336
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:07,184
- But I gotta, Mr. Fusco.
- Sorry, Tony.

1337
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:09,478
Look, all I'm asking for
is one afternoon off.

1338
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:11,772
I've been here almost eight months.
I didn't miss a day yet!

1339
01:18:11,897 --> 01:18:14,858
- Not today, Tony.
- Oh, come on, Mr. Fusco.

1340
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:17,360
Some of those old farts,
they miss three, four days at a time,

1341
01:18:17,444 --> 01:18:18,653
you don't say nothing to them.

1342
01:18:18,737 --> 01:18:20,280
Hey, cool off.

1343
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:22,908
Look, I got to have the afternoon off.
I'm taking it.

1344
01:18:22,991 --> 01:18:25,285
- You do, you're fired.
- I'm doing it.

1345
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:28,747
- Then you're fired!
- Then fuck you, asshole!

1346
01:18:29,581 --> 01:18:31,750
And the fuck horse you rode in on.

1347
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:33,502
- Fucking cocksucker asshole!
- Tony.

1348
01:18:33,585 --> 01:18:36,588
Tony, I don't wanna marry Pauline.
I don't give a fuck about this cunt.

1349
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:39,549
- So, don't marry her!
- Tony, I gotta marry her!

1350
01:18:39,633 --> 01:18:41,259
Fuck it. She won't get the abortion.

1351
01:18:41,343 --> 01:18:44,096
- Everyone says I gotta marry her, Tony.
- Who says that?

1352
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:46,598
Oh, fuck, her fucking parents,
my fucking parents.

1353
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:48,683
The fucking priest on the corner.

1354
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:51,520
Her fucking high school
guidance counselor.

1355
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:53,980
Tony, I'm paralyzed.
I got no more control.

1356
01:18:54,106 --> 01:18:56,525
I mean, you and me, Tony,
we've been friends for so long.

1357
01:18:56,608 --> 01:18:58,610
I mean, I'm hurting.

1358
01:18:59,653 --> 01:19:02,656
Shit! You're always together.

1359
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:05,575
And I'm always fucking up,
and you're always all right. You know?

1360
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:09,162
I... Oh, come on.
Everybody fucks up. Really.

1361
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:11,957
- Don't worry about nothing.
- You know, you're great.

1362
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,334
I'm in a terrible rush.
I hate to leave you like this.

1363
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:16,169
You got no idea
how much I appreciate this.

1364
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:18,171
I mean, this car's very important
for me today, you know?

1365
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:20,048
- Will you call me tonight?
- Yeah, I'll call you.

1366
01:19:20,132 --> 01:19:22,092
Don't worry about nothing, all right?
Take care.

1367
01:19:22,175 --> 01:19:24,845
- I'll talk to you later then?
- Yeah.

1368
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:27,097
- Call me tonight, right?
- Yeah.

1369
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,474
You're gonna call me tonight?

1370
01:20:03,508 --> 01:20:06,011
You know, Stephanie, this got me fired.

1371
01:20:06,094 --> 01:20:07,929
- What?
- This got me fired.

1372
01:20:08,013 --> 01:20:11,933
You know, you couldn't do it on Sunday,
so, my boss, he fired me.

1373
01:20:12,017 --> 01:20:13,977
Well, I just wanted
to get everything in, you know,

1374
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,937
so I could start fixing up
when I move in on Saturday.

1375
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:17,147
Yeah.

1376
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:20,233
Nobody bitched at my office.
I got the whole day off.

1377
01:20:22,402 --> 01:20:23,862
Hey, I'm sorry.

1378
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:27,240
Oh, it's all right. No problem.
No big deal. I can handle it.

1379
01:21:29,427 --> 01:21:31,846
Yeah, come on in.

1380
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:34,599
Now, put that over here.

1381
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:36,518
Hey!

1382
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:39,104
I thought you were
gonna be out of town.

1383
01:21:39,187 --> 01:21:41,106
I postponed the trip.

1384
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:47,362
Jay, this is Tony Manero. He's a friend.

1385
01:21:47,445 --> 01:21:50,699
- Tony, this is Jay Langhart.
- Unspecified status.

1386
01:21:50,782 --> 01:21:52,701
How do you do?

1387
01:21:52,784 --> 01:21:55,328
Well, I've decided to leave you
all the furniture.

1388
01:21:55,412 --> 01:21:57,539
What, are you kidding?
You're not gonna take any of this stuff?

1389
01:21:57,622 --> 01:22:00,333
No, I'm gonna start fresh. What the hell,
you picked out most of it anyway.

1390
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:03,003
- Well, super.
- Stephanie, I told you not to say "super."

1391
01:22:03,086 --> 01:22:05,839
Nobody says "super" anymore.

1392
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:09,175
Can I get you a beer? Glass of wine?

1393
01:22:09,259 --> 01:22:11,720
No, man, it's all right.

1394
01:22:11,803 --> 01:22:14,097
Hey, I read that book you told me to.
You know, the...

1395
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,016
Kerr or the Lawson?

1396
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:19,102
- The Kerr.
- Should have read the Lawson.

1397
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:24,774
Listen, if I can help you guys move in,
you just say the word. Be glad to help.

1398
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,577
I'll get the rest of the stuff.

1399
01:22:46,838 --> 01:22:49,132
Stephanie, who is that guy?

1400
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:53,178
He's an arranger, a record producer.
He wants to do films.

1401
01:22:53,261 --> 01:22:56,014
He's gonna move now
to a more expensive apartment.

1402
01:22:56,097 --> 01:22:58,058
I met him at the agency.

1403
01:22:58,141 --> 01:23:00,310
He didn't want his wife
to know how much money he had

1404
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:02,687
until the divorce was final.

1405
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:04,981
Come on. Let's go.

1406
01:23:05,065 --> 01:23:08,943
I mean, who is he to you, Stephanie?
That's what I'm talking about.

1407
01:23:10,111 --> 01:23:13,031
He's a friend of mine, okay?
He's a friend.

1408
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:17,035
And I was living with him
for a little while.

1409
01:23:17,118 --> 01:23:19,496
Are you in love with this man or what?
I mean, tell me the story.

1410
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:22,791
- That's all I'm asking, is the story.
- No, I'm not. We had a thing.

1411
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:25,085
You know?
It didn't work out, and it's over now,

1412
01:23:25,168 --> 01:23:27,295
and he's my friend, and he still likes me.

1413
01:23:27,379 --> 01:23:29,047
He likes you. He likes you to have...

1414
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,424
To have you around for a quick piece
when he feels like it.

1415
01:23:31,508 --> 01:23:34,135
He helped me, man. You don't know
what it's like at that place.

1416
01:23:34,219 --> 01:23:36,596
It's crazy. You don't know shit!

1417
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:40,600
You know? I didn't know how to do stuff,
so I'd go to him and I would ask him,

1418
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,811
and he would tell me how to do things.

1419
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:45,188
And then I'd go back to work
and everything would be all right.

1420
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:47,148
Otherwise, I'd be walking around
like an idiot,

1421
01:23:47,232 --> 01:23:49,401
going, "I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know."

1422
01:23:49,484 --> 01:23:51,486
- And he helps me. He does.
- Yeah, he helps you. Helps you what?

1423
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:54,030
Get in and out of the sack?
Is that what he helps you do?

1424
01:23:54,114 --> 01:23:55,657
- He helped me.
- Sure.

1425
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,034
What the hell do you
expect me to do, man?

1426
01:23:58,118 --> 01:24:01,121
What do you expect me to do?
He helped me.

1427
01:24:10,672 --> 01:24:13,383
Don't cry about it. I mean, you know.

1428
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:16,511
All right, so he helped you.
That's good for you.

1429
01:24:20,306 --> 01:24:23,059
All right. Come on. Let's get out of here.

1430
01:24:24,018 --> 01:24:25,395
I'm sorry.

1431
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:29,023
It's all right.
Don't worry about nothing.

1432
01:24:29,107 --> 01:24:32,193
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about nothing.

1433
01:24:32,277 --> 01:24:34,028
Stephanie, don't.

1434
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:37,949
Look, we'll stop here for a while.
We'll sit down. All right?

1435
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:40,285
Don't stop. Just take me home.
Just take me home, man.

1436
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:42,078
No, come on, we'll sit here
for a while, all right?

1437
01:24:42,162 --> 01:24:44,581
Just, don't worry about nothing.

1438
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,839
It's pretty, isn't it?

1439
01:24:59,971 --> 01:25:01,431
Sit down.

1440
01:25:13,568 --> 01:25:15,778
You know how tall that bridge is?

1441
01:25:15,862 --> 01:25:19,365
That bridge, that tower right there,
goes up 690 feet.

1442
01:25:20,074 --> 01:25:23,495
They got 40 million cars
going across there a year.

1443
01:25:23,828 --> 01:25:28,124
127,000 tons of steel is involved in that.

1444
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:30,418
The concrete there,

1445
01:25:30,502 --> 01:25:34,464
they got almost three-quarter
of a million yards of concrete.

1446
01:25:34,547 --> 01:25:35,673
That's right.

1447
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:40,386
The center span, right there,
is 4,260 feet long.

1448
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:43,223
And with the on-ramps,
it all together totals, like,

1449
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:45,725
something like 2.5 miles.

1450
01:25:47,143 --> 01:25:49,562
You know all about the bridge,
don't you?

1451
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,523
That's right.

1452
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:53,983
I know everything about that bridge.

1453
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:58,112
You know what else?
They got a guy buried in the cement.

1454
01:25:58,863 --> 01:26:00,365
Yeah?

1455
01:26:01,324 --> 01:26:03,409
Know how it happened?

1456
01:26:03,493 --> 01:26:05,912
Well, they was working on it,
apparently, at the time.

1457
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:09,165
And they, I guess,
they were pouring the cement,

1458
01:26:09,249 --> 01:26:10,792
and he slipped off, you know,

1459
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:14,879
on the upper part of the bridge
and, you know, fell in.

1460
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:19,217
Dumb fuck.

1461
01:26:19,634 --> 01:26:21,844
- What a way to go.
- I come down here a lot.

1462
01:26:21,928 --> 01:26:23,930
You know, I get ideas.

1463
01:26:24,013 --> 01:26:26,641
Oh, yeah? What kind of ideas you get?

1464
01:26:27,308 --> 01:26:30,770
I don't know, daydreams, you know?
I daydream a lot.

1465
01:26:56,212 --> 01:26:58,631
Mr. Fusco, I come for what I got coming.

1466
01:26:58,715 --> 01:27:00,008
Tony. Come on.

1467
01:27:00,091 --> 01:27:02,635
Things got a little hot under the collar,
don't you think?

1468
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,012
What are you talking about?

1469
01:27:04,095 --> 01:27:06,431
I don't want to lose you, Tony.
You're a good kid.

1470
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:09,934
Customers like you.
I want you to stay on.

1471
01:27:10,018 --> 01:27:13,605
- You mean, I ain't fired?
- No. Come on. Here.

1472
01:27:13,688 --> 01:27:16,899
- Jesus Christ. I don't believe this.
- You got a future here, Tony.

1473
01:27:16,983 --> 01:27:19,986
Here, Harold's with me 18 years,
since I opened.

1474
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:22,196
Mike, 15 years, huh?

1475
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:26,200
Come on, now. Give Harold
a hand, huh? He's making a mess.

1476
01:27:43,343 --> 01:27:45,428
Pete, what are you doing?

1477
01:27:46,763 --> 01:27:48,681
Trying to get up to 70%?

1478
01:27:48,765 --> 01:27:52,435
Whoa, man.
I didn't know you hung your label on her.

1479
01:27:53,978 --> 01:27:55,229
What are you doing?

1480
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:57,649
That guy's the biggest cunt hound
in Bay Ridge.

1481
01:27:57,732 --> 01:27:59,609
Oh, my God.
I've been in serious danger.

1482
01:27:59,692 --> 01:28:03,571
It's no fucking joke, Stephanie.
That guy's a fucking sleazy whore.

1483
01:28:05,448 --> 01:28:08,660
I was dancing with the fella.
You know? Dancing.

1484
01:28:08,743 --> 01:28:11,871
- No, no. No, forget it.
- Come on. Let's dance, huh?

1485
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:14,207
You disgust me, you know that?

1486
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,500
- Well, what do you mean?
- Forget it.

1487
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:18,086
- Forget it.
- Tony, I was just dancing with the guy.

1488
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:22,298
<i>I don't want nobody, baby</i>

1489
01:28:23,091 --> 01:28:24,467
Tony! Tony!

1490
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:27,595
- Annette, what do you want?
- Just look. Look.

1491
01:28:32,684 --> 01:28:34,102
Oh, Jesus.

1492
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:40,191
<i>If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby</i>

1493
01:28:40,274 --> 01:28:42,777
<i>If I can't have you</i>

1494
01:28:43,152 --> 01:28:45,196
<i>Nobody
If I can't have you</i>

1495
01:29:21,607 --> 01:29:24,986
Beautiful, man. They got six or seven
of them in there and a couple of chicks.

1496
01:29:25,069 --> 01:29:27,822
Listen, why don't we wait till they get
down to about three, four people?

1497
01:29:27,905 --> 01:29:29,240
- Yeah, one or two?
- Tony!

1498
01:29:29,323 --> 01:29:32,410
- All right. I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
- Tony, listen, you gotta help...

1499
01:29:32,493 --> 01:29:35,079
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Back up, all right?

1500
01:29:35,163 --> 01:29:37,623
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Double J?

1501
01:29:37,707 --> 01:29:40,585
- Trying to back it up!
- What are you, crazy?

1502
01:29:41,502 --> 01:29:44,380
- Tony, I'm gonna get married.
- Shut up!

1503
01:29:46,174 --> 01:29:48,176
Come on, fuckers!

1504
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:04,776
Tony!

1505
01:30:13,034 --> 01:30:16,788
Tony! Tony, help me! Please, God!

1506
01:30:24,504 --> 01:30:27,256
Hey, what the hell
you think you're doing, huh?

1507
01:30:53,783 --> 01:30:55,076
Ton!

1508
01:30:59,163 --> 01:31:02,333
Ton! Come here, it's me! Come on!

1509
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:04,877
- Let's get out of here.
- You okay?

1510
01:31:08,756 --> 01:31:10,049
Jesus!

1511
01:31:12,969 --> 01:31:15,263
He chickened, man! Where is he?

1512
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:25,106
Go, man! Go!

1513
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:32,488
- Where the hell were you, huh?
- Tony, I was just driving around.

1514
01:31:32,572 --> 01:31:36,242
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- I was looking for you. Where were you?

1515
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:46,836
What's this?

1516
01:31:48,296 --> 01:31:49,672
Sign it?

1517
01:31:58,431 --> 01:31:59,599
Here, you got a telegram.

1518
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:13,195
I'm going back to work.

1519
01:32:13,821 --> 01:32:16,282
- They called me back to work.
- Thank God!

1520
01:32:17,325 --> 01:32:19,619
I'm going back to... Back to work.

1521
01:32:21,287 --> 01:32:23,205
I don't believe this!

1522
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:25,207
Not in front of the kid, huh?

1523
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:26,375
Hey, Tony.

1524
01:32:26,459 --> 01:32:27,835
Now, just because
I'm going back to work,

1525
01:32:27,919 --> 01:32:29,170
that doesn't mean you don't contribute.

1526
01:32:29,629 --> 01:32:31,881
- Yeah, it's gonna be less, though.
- Oh, no.

1527
01:32:31,964 --> 01:32:34,300
This family's gotta start
saving some money back up.

1528
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:37,136
What? For your old age, my money?
What are you, crazy?

1529
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:39,305
Why not?

1530
01:32:40,139 --> 01:32:42,058
Look, you're going back to work now,

1531
01:32:42,141 --> 01:32:44,310
so I don't have to keep on
still supporting this family.

1532
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:47,313
I don't want any more sausages.
I don't like them.

1533
01:32:48,022 --> 01:32:51,567
- And you now what else I'd like to do?
- I know what you want. Get out of here.

1534
01:32:51,859 --> 01:32:54,111
Hey, Gus. Did you get
the number of the truck that hit you?

1535
01:32:54,195 --> 01:32:56,155
Don't make me laugh, all right?
Do not make me laugh.

1536
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:58,240
- Look at this. We don't love you, right?
- Right.

1537
01:32:58,324 --> 01:32:59,867
- We got them.
- Does that hurt?

1538
01:32:59,951 --> 01:33:01,410
Yeah, really, huh?

1539
01:33:01,494 --> 01:33:04,163
Hey, you guys really, you know,
you really kicked their asses?

1540
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:06,624
Hey, come on, we got them
where they breathe, Italian style.

1541
01:33:06,707 --> 01:33:08,042
Yeah, that's great, you know.

1542
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:11,379
Only, you know,
I ain't so sure it was the Barracudas.

1543
01:33:11,462 --> 01:33:13,589
<i>Dr. Allison to Emergency.</i>

1544
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:22,139
Hey, what are you talking about?
You said it was.

1545
01:33:22,223 --> 01:33:24,183
No, I said it probably was.

1546
01:33:24,266 --> 01:33:25,601
Don't be pulling our legs now.

1547
01:33:25,685 --> 01:33:28,604
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1548
01:33:28,688 --> 01:33:30,731
- You said it probably was.
- Yeah, I said probably.

1549
01:33:30,815 --> 01:33:33,067
- That's what you told us.
- I said probably 'cause I wasn't sure.

1550
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:35,236
You know? I mean,
it could've been a Spanish...

1551
01:33:35,319 --> 01:33:37,196
Stupid, fucking bastard.

1552
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:41,659
- We almost got our heads busted.
- Yeah, not you, lover.

1553
01:33:52,169 --> 01:33:54,755
You know, you got some fucking pair
of balls on you, you know that, Gus?

1554
01:33:54,839 --> 01:33:55,923
- Hey, hey, come on.
- You know that?

1555
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:59,009
Hey, you know, I had to say something.
Right? I had to lay somebody out for it.

1556
01:33:59,093 --> 01:34:01,178
What are you, stupid?
You can't see who hurt you, right?

1557
01:34:01,262 --> 01:34:02,388
Oh, my God, what are you doing?

1558
01:34:02,513 --> 01:34:04,807
If I said I didn't know who it was,
they would have got off. Come on.

1559
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:06,642
Yeah, well, fuck you, Gus.
You know what I feel like doing?

1560
01:34:06,726 --> 01:34:09,186
I feel like breaking your broken leg.
That's what I feel like doing.

1561
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:10,521
- Hey, come on.
- Let's get out of here.

1562
01:34:10,604 --> 01:34:13,232
Oh, God, I can't believe
this whole fucking thing.

1563
01:34:14,358 --> 01:34:16,318
You wanna know something?
I could have killed him.

1564
01:34:16,402 --> 01:34:17,778
You couldn't kill a fucking crab lice.

1565
01:34:17,862 --> 01:34:19,613
Oh, shit, what do you think I am?

1566
01:34:19,697 --> 01:34:22,199
- You think I'm a coward?
- What do you think you are?

1567
01:34:22,283 --> 01:34:24,076
Enough of that shit, already. I'm bored.

1568
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,328
I'm bored with it, all right?

1569
01:34:39,925 --> 01:34:43,512
Hey, hey. Jeez, look at this.
You're beautiful, babe.

1570
01:34:43,596 --> 01:34:46,474
Hey, come on. We got the winners here.
Let's get a table. Let's go.

1571
01:34:46,557 --> 01:34:48,809
Yeah. Let's get a table.

1572
01:34:50,853 --> 01:34:53,522
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

1573
01:34:55,483 --> 01:34:57,860
What happened to your face, huh?

1574
01:34:57,943 --> 01:34:59,904
I cut myself shaving.

1575
01:35:00,404 --> 01:35:02,364
With a switchblade, huh?

1576
01:35:02,448 --> 01:35:03,991
Come on.

1577
01:35:14,168 --> 01:35:16,545
<i>Climb aboard my magic carpet</i>

1578
01:35:16,629 --> 01:35:21,342
<i>And let us take a ride to the oasis
Get down with the genie</i>

1579
01:35:21,425 --> 01:35:25,596
<i>Feel the power and the spirit</i>

1580
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:28,015
<i>Of the genie
Get down with the genie</i>

1581
01:35:28,098 --> 01:35:31,018
<i>Yeah! Come on! Do it!</i>

1582
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:52,665
<i>Open sesame</i>

1583
01:35:56,252 --> 01:35:58,838
<i>Get down with the genie</i>

1584
01:36:00,297 --> 01:36:02,258
<i>Get down with the genie</i>

1585
01:36:02,341 --> 01:36:04,718
<i>A big hand
for Shirley and Charles Tuck.</i>

1586
01:36:04,844 --> 01:36:07,137
<i>Give them a big hand.
Come on, everybody.</i>

1587
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:10,099
<i>What are you booing?
Come on, be cool, everybody.</i>

1588
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:13,102
No way. No good. No way.

1589
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:14,395
Yes!

1590
01:36:14,895 --> 01:36:17,857
<i>Now we have Stephanie Mangano
and Tony Manero!</i>

1591
01:36:18,691 --> 01:36:19,859
<i>Come on.</i>

1592
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:21,360
All right.

1593
01:36:27,575 --> 01:36:29,493
Joey, hey, give me
another one of those, huh?

1594
01:36:29,577 --> 01:36:30,911
Hey, come on, you had enough.

1595
01:36:31,036 --> 01:36:32,454
Come on. I like it.
They're good. Come on.

1596
01:36:32,538 --> 01:36:34,498
All right. Get high.
You know, it's your head.

1597
01:36:34,582 --> 01:36:37,209
- That's right.
- Here you go.

1598
01:36:43,924 --> 01:36:47,052
<i>Oh, girl, I've known you very well</i>

1599
01:36:47,386 --> 01:36:51,724
<i>I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before</i>

1600
01:36:51,974 --> 01:36:54,184
<i>But now you take my breath away</i>

1601
01:36:54,268 --> 01:36:58,314
<i>Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do</i>

1602
01:36:58,397 --> 01:37:03,444
<i>You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you</i>

1603
01:37:03,569 --> 01:37:07,573
<i>Here in your arms
I found my paradise</i>

1604
01:37:08,115 --> 01:37:11,911
<i>My only chance for happiness</i>

1605
01:37:12,786 --> 01:37:16,707
<i>And if I lose you now
I think I would die</i>

1606
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:21,128
<i>Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine</i>

1607
01:37:21,462 --> 01:37:26,258
<i>We can take forever
just a minute at a time</i>

1608
01:37:28,594 --> 01:37:30,971
<i>More than a woman</i>

1609
01:37:33,098 --> 01:37:35,768
<i>More than a woman to me</i>

1610
01:37:37,603 --> 01:37:39,980
<i>More than a woman</i>

1611
01:37:41,941 --> 01:37:45,486
<i>More than a woman to me</i>

1612
01:37:55,454 --> 01:38:00,334
<i>There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me</i>

1613
01:38:00,459 --> 01:38:04,171
<i>And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself</i>

1614
01:38:04,296 --> 01:38:06,757
<i>Reflecting how I feel for you</i>

1615
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,842
<i>Thinking about those people then</i>

1616
01:38:08,968 --> 01:38:13,389
<i>I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again</i>

1617
01:38:14,139 --> 01:38:17,643
<i>This is the only way
That we should fly</i>

1618
01:38:18,519 --> 01:38:21,188
<i>This is the only way to go</i>

1619
01:38:22,982 --> 01:38:26,902
<i>And if I lose your love
I know I would die</i>

1620
01:38:26,986 --> 01:38:31,407
<i>Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine</i>

1621
01:38:31,907 --> 01:38:38,789
<i>We can take forever
Just a minute at a time</i>

1622
01:38:38,872 --> 01:38:41,333
<i>More than a woman</i>

1623
01:38:42,501 --> 01:38:46,338
<i>You are
More than a woman to me</i>

1624
01:38:47,923 --> 01:38:52,011
<i>More than a woman
Baby</i>

1625
01:38:52,261 --> 01:38:55,264
<i>More than a woman to me</i>

1626
01:39:08,402 --> 01:39:11,363
<i>More than a woman</i>

1627
01:39:13,032 --> 01:39:16,035
<i>More than a woman to me</i>

1628
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:22,082
<i>More than a woman
Baby</i>

1629
01:39:22,207 --> 01:39:24,710
<i>More than a woman to me</i>

1630
01:39:26,545 --> 01:39:29,465
<i>More than a woman</i>

1631
01:39:31,258 --> 01:39:33,927
<i>More than a woman to me</i>

1632
01:39:35,763 --> 01:39:38,640
<i>More than a woman</i>

1633
01:39:39,892 --> 01:39:43,312
<i>More than a woman to me</i>

1634
01:39:56,784 --> 01:39:59,203
Right on! That is the money.

1635
01:40:05,918 --> 01:40:09,129
<i>Hey! Hey, be cool, baby!</i>

1636
01:40:09,254 --> 01:40:12,257
<i>Here now, we have couple number 15,
the Puerto Ricans...</i>

1637
01:40:24,019 --> 01:40:25,479
Wrong neighborhood, huh?

1638
01:40:25,604 --> 01:40:28,273
Tony, listen to me,
you're gonna take the prize.

1639
01:41:09,857 --> 01:41:11,733
Jesus Christ. They're so fucking good.

1640
01:41:11,817 --> 01:41:13,527
How could they be? They're spics.

1641
01:41:13,652 --> 01:41:15,988
Look at them greasing up the floor.

1642
01:42:07,706 --> 01:42:09,249
<i>Numero uno!</i>

1643
01:42:10,042 --> 01:42:11,668
No contest, man. No contest.

1644
01:42:11,752 --> 01:42:14,087
I don't want to hear that shit.
They was fucking better than us.

1645
01:42:14,213 --> 01:42:16,548
They weren't better, they was different,
that's all. Just different.

1646
01:42:16,632 --> 01:42:18,800
- Bullshit.
<i>- All right, folks!</i>

1647
01:42:18,884 --> 01:42:20,677
<i>We have the decision of the judges.</i>

1648
01:42:20,761 --> 01:42:23,889
<i>In third place,
we have Elizabeth and Joseph Cursa!</i>

1649
01:42:23,972 --> 01:42:25,474
<i>Give them a hand!</i>

1650
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:26,892
<i>Baby!</i>

1651
01:42:27,643 --> 01:42:28,852
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

1652
01:42:28,936 --> 01:42:30,062
<i>Yeah!</i>

1653
01:42:33,565 --> 01:42:35,067
<i>Second prize!</i>

1654
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:38,904
<i>From Puerto Rico, we have
Cesar Rodriguez, Maria Huerta!</i>

1655
01:42:41,907 --> 01:42:45,452
- You're doing them a favor!
- They're gonna take the prize.

1656
01:42:46,411 --> 01:42:47,621
- Thank you.
- Unbelievable!

1657
01:42:47,746 --> 01:42:49,915
<i>- Don't spend it in one place, baby.</i>
- Thank you.

1658
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:53,418
<i>In first place, the coolest,</i>

1659
01:42:53,502 --> 01:42:55,420
<i>the Fred Astaire of Brooklyn,
the boogie-woogie man,</i>

1660
01:42:55,504 --> 01:42:58,006
<i>the man who gave you coolness,
hotness and everything you wanted.</i>

1661
01:42:58,090 --> 01:43:00,509
<i>He was hot! He was right on!</i>

1662
01:43:00,592 --> 01:43:03,262
<i>Stephanie Mangano and Tony Manero.</i>

1663
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,932
We won.

1664
01:43:10,185 --> 01:43:12,479
Come on. Come on!

1665
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:17,484
Didn't I tell you?

1666
01:43:21,697 --> 01:43:23,073
Won.

1667
01:43:24,992 --> 01:43:27,744
<i>Well, you can tell
By the way I use my walk</i>

1668
01:43:27,828 --> 01:43:30,539
<i>I'm a woman's man
No time to talk</i>

1669
01:43:31,665 --> 01:43:33,500
<i>Come on, let's boogie.
Come on, everybody.</i>

1670
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:37,129
<i>It's over. Come on, let's dance.
Come on, everybody!</i>

1671
01:43:37,629 --> 01:43:40,007
<i>And you may look the other way</i>

1672
01:43:40,132 --> 01:43:42,175
<i>And we can try
To understand</i>

1673
01:43:42,301 --> 01:43:44,594
<i>The</i> New York Times' <i>effect on man</i>

1674
01:43:44,678 --> 01:43:47,472
Man, you put them down,
is what you did, huh?

1675
01:43:47,556 --> 01:43:49,057
You phony bastards!

1676
01:43:49,141 --> 01:43:51,393
You know who should have won
that contest.

1677
01:43:51,476 --> 01:43:53,603
My own fucking friends
can't even be straight with me.

1678
01:43:53,687 --> 01:43:55,605
You gotta lie
right through your fucking teeth.

1679
01:43:55,689 --> 01:43:57,441
- Come on!
- What's up your ass, man?

1680
01:43:57,524 --> 01:44:00,527
- Look, we won it.
- Stephanie, that was rigged.

1681
01:44:00,652 --> 01:44:03,155
That's like family. They can't give it
to no spic or no stranger.

1682
01:44:03,238 --> 01:44:04,364
What are you, crazy?

1683
01:44:04,489 --> 01:44:07,367
We was just as good
as they were, Tony, and I know it.

1684
01:44:07,492 --> 01:44:09,578
- Oh, you think so, huh?
- Yeah!

1685
01:44:12,164 --> 01:44:14,750
Here. Come with me.

1686
01:44:16,084 --> 01:44:19,421
Excuse me. Congratulations. Here.

1687
01:44:19,504 --> 01:44:21,131
I'd like to give this,
I'd like to give you that,

1688
01:44:21,214 --> 01:44:23,717
'cause I think you deserve it, all right?
Come on.

1689
01:44:24,593 --> 01:44:27,346
God damn it! Good is good.
If the spics are good, they deserve it.

1690
01:44:27,429 --> 01:44:29,389
- That's all there is to it.
- Yeah, but we won it. They didn't.

1691
01:44:29,514 --> 01:44:32,184
This is a fucking shit hole,
you know that? A fucking shit hole!

1692
01:44:32,267 --> 01:44:35,020
God damn it.
My friends, the assholes I hang out with,

1693
01:44:35,103 --> 01:44:37,564
I can't believe them sometimes.
You know that?

1694
01:44:37,689 --> 01:44:40,609
Everybody's gotta dump
on somebody, right? Of course.

1695
01:44:40,692 --> 01:44:43,278
I mean, everybody...
Everybody can't do it straight, right?

1696
01:44:43,362 --> 01:44:45,364
My pa goes to work,
he gets dumped on,

1697
01:44:45,447 --> 01:44:47,240
so he comes home
and he dumps on my mother, right?

1698
01:44:47,366 --> 01:44:49,326
Of course, right?
Then the spics, they dump on us,

1699
01:44:49,409 --> 01:44:51,495
so we gotta dump on spics.
Of course, right?

1700
01:44:51,578 --> 01:44:54,206
Everybody's dumping on everybody.

1701
01:44:54,289 --> 01:44:56,792
Even the humping's dumping
most of the time.

1702
01:44:56,875 --> 01:45:00,212
All right. Okay. Listen, would you just
tell me what's wrong? Okay?

1703
01:45:00,295 --> 01:45:01,505
- Get in.
- What is it?

1704
01:45:01,588 --> 01:45:03,715
- Get in!
- Just tell me.

1705
01:45:10,889 --> 01:45:13,266
What the hell is wrong with you?

1706
01:45:19,106 --> 01:45:22,401
Wait. Stop it. Look, just stop it!

1707
01:45:22,484 --> 01:45:25,195
Let me alone, man!
Come on. Get away!

1708
01:45:25,278 --> 01:45:27,197
You know, you're such
a fucking cockteaser, you know that?

1709
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,074
Don't you fucking call me
no goddamn cockteaser!

1710
01:45:29,157 --> 01:45:30,283
You are a cockteaser!

1711
01:45:30,409 --> 01:45:32,202
- Why you hanging around with me?
- Dancing, that's why.

1712
01:45:32,285 --> 01:45:34,079
- Oh, dancing, huh? Why else?
- Yeah!

1713
01:45:34,162 --> 01:45:36,623
You wanna know?
It's bullshit, that's why. Bullshit, man.

1714
01:45:36,748 --> 01:45:39,209
I've just been
dumping my bullshit all over you,

1715
01:45:39,292 --> 01:45:40,585
selling my act on you,

1716
01:45:40,669 --> 01:45:42,879
using you,
making you think that I love you!

1717
01:45:42,963 --> 01:45:44,798
It's just all bullshit, man!

1718
01:45:44,923 --> 01:45:48,844
- You fucking cunt!
- Don't fucking start! You stop it! Don't!

1719
01:45:50,637 --> 01:45:51,680
Get off of me.

1720
01:45:53,515 --> 01:45:55,058
Oh, Stephanie.

1721
01:46:11,616 --> 01:46:13,702
- I'm mad at you, Tony.
- Hey, Tony, come on.

1722
01:46:13,785 --> 01:46:15,745
Annette's gonna give everybody
a piece of snatch pie.

1723
01:46:15,829 --> 01:46:17,038
Yeah.

1724
01:46:17,456 --> 01:46:19,916
Oh, yeah? The fuck you are.
I wanna talk to you.

1725
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,294
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What is with you, huh?

1726
01:46:22,377 --> 01:46:24,671
- What's with you, you little punk?
- What are you doing?

1727
01:46:24,796 --> 01:46:28,300
- What is it, man? What the fuck is it?
- You don't give a shit about her!

1728
01:46:31,303 --> 01:46:33,555
Come on, Annette. Get in the car.

1729
01:46:42,147 --> 01:46:44,357
Come on. Do it.

1730
01:46:49,905 --> 01:46:52,699
I told you.
You can fuck all night on this speed.

1731
01:46:52,824 --> 01:46:53,992
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you will.

1732
01:46:54,075 --> 01:46:56,119
Joey, what you doing back there?

1733
01:46:56,203 --> 01:46:58,121
Hey, you fuck.
The first is always the best.

1734
01:46:58,205 --> 01:46:59,789
That's right.

1735
01:47:08,381 --> 01:47:10,217
Yes. Yes.

1736
01:47:11,384 --> 01:47:12,761
Joey?

1737
01:47:14,679 --> 01:47:15,931
Oh, God.

1738
01:47:20,936 --> 01:47:24,147
Come on, Double J. You're up.

1739
01:47:24,231 --> 01:47:26,274
See you guys later, huh?

1740
01:47:29,444 --> 01:47:32,030
- No. Joey.
- Come on, mother.

1741
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:33,949
- Oh, yeah! My turn.
- No. You know what?

1742
01:47:34,032 --> 01:47:37,118
No, Double J. No, I don't wanna do it.

1743
01:47:42,249 --> 01:47:44,000
Fuck-A!

1744
01:47:46,711 --> 01:47:49,130
Shit. With me she's gotta cry?

1745
01:47:49,214 --> 01:47:52,842
- God damn, Annette. Come on.
- No. No. Don't.

1746
01:47:52,926 --> 01:47:54,386
Come on.

1747
01:48:05,146 --> 01:48:06,398
Yeah!

1748
01:48:11,236 --> 01:48:13,655
Fuck! Double J!

1749
01:48:13,738 --> 01:48:16,241
Come on, Double J! Come on!

1750
01:48:22,289 --> 01:48:26,334
- Give me a beer huh?
- Hey! Hey! With no pants.

1751
01:48:26,418 --> 01:48:28,253
And no hands!

1752
01:48:29,254 --> 01:48:30,672
Here, beer.

1753
01:48:33,258 --> 01:48:35,677
- All right!
- All right.

1754
01:48:35,927 --> 01:48:39,055
Fuck you, Manhattan!
Come to Brooklyn!

1755
01:48:43,101 --> 01:48:45,353
Mine's so big, I gotta strap it to my leg.

1756
01:48:45,437 --> 01:48:48,189
Anita says
I got the biggest thing in town.

1757
01:48:49,316 --> 01:48:51,276
Proud of yourself now?

1758
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:55,113
Is that what you wanted? Good.

1759
01:48:57,032 --> 01:48:58,783
Now you're a cunt.

1760
01:49:00,285 --> 01:49:03,121
Man, don't fuck around.
What are you doing?

1761
01:49:05,957 --> 01:49:08,126
Where you going? Annette.

1762
01:49:14,049 --> 01:49:16,635
No. No. No. Leave me.

1763
01:49:20,305 --> 01:49:22,390
Come on, Annette. I'm sorry.

1764
01:49:24,184 --> 01:49:28,063
- Annette, I said I'm sorry.
- I didn't want to do it.

1765
01:49:30,023 --> 01:49:31,399
Look at this guy.

1766
01:49:31,483 --> 01:49:33,526
Hey, Bobby! Hey, you punk!

1767
01:49:33,652 --> 01:49:36,279
Tony! Look at me!

1768
01:49:36,363 --> 01:49:39,908
- Look at the punk.
- Bobby, get down. It's too dangerous.

1769
01:49:39,991 --> 01:49:44,829
Look at me, Tony.
Hey, Tony, look at me!

1770
01:49:44,913 --> 01:49:47,040
Look! Hey, Tony!

1771
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:50,919
I'm not kidding, Bobby.
Get down from there.

1772
01:49:51,002 --> 01:49:53,254
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1773
01:49:54,422 --> 01:49:57,926
I'm all right, Tony.
I'm all right. Watch me.

1774
01:50:06,267 --> 01:50:09,688
- Hey, Tony, look at me!
- That's crazy. Now you're being crazy.

1775
01:50:09,771 --> 01:50:11,773
Look at me, look at me, look at me.
I'm doing it.

1776
01:50:11,856 --> 01:50:13,108
- It's too dangerous.
- Look at me.

1777
01:50:13,191 --> 01:50:15,068
- I see you.
- Look at me.

1778
01:50:16,569 --> 01:50:18,029
Oh, Jesus.

1779
01:50:21,032 --> 01:50:23,451
It's a long way down there.

1780
01:50:25,036 --> 01:50:27,038
- Give me your hand.
- I did it!

1781
01:50:27,122 --> 01:50:29,541
Come back. Come back in. Come on.

1782
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:33,336
- Watch.
- Don't, don't.

1783
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:36,131
You're making me
very nervous now, Bobby.

1784
01:50:36,214 --> 01:50:38,383
Don't do that. Jesus Christ.

1785
01:50:38,466 --> 01:50:42,387
Get over here. Get over here, right now!
Give me your hand.

1786
01:50:43,638 --> 01:50:46,307
Oh, Jesus! No. No!

1787
01:50:46,391 --> 01:50:48,768
- Oh, come on.
- I did it.

1788
01:50:48,893 --> 01:50:51,646
- What did you do?
- I did it.

1789
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:52,981
Watch.

1790
01:50:56,901 --> 01:50:59,696
Come on, Bobby. Get over here.
Right now. Come on.

1791
01:50:59,779 --> 01:51:01,531
Now, don't get upset.
Come on. We'll talk.

1792
01:51:01,614 --> 01:51:03,616
We'll go talk in the car.
It's warmer there.

1793
01:51:03,742 --> 01:51:05,994
You didn't talk to me before.

1794
01:51:07,245 --> 01:51:09,622
How come you never called me?

1795
01:51:12,751 --> 01:51:15,086
- I didn't wanna fuck up.
- You didn't fuck up, Bobby.

1796
01:51:15,170 --> 01:51:19,340
- Come on. We'll talk, all right?
- I didn't wanna fuck up this time.

1797
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:30,101
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1798
01:51:40,612 --> 01:51:41,780
No!

1799
01:51:53,333 --> 01:51:56,294
Any of you guys think
maybe he killed himself?

1800
01:51:56,377 --> 01:51:57,629
No.

1801
01:52:01,966 --> 01:52:04,844
There's ways of killing yourself
without killing yourself.

1802
01:52:04,969 --> 01:52:08,306
Yeah. Okay, you can go now.

1803
01:52:14,187 --> 01:52:15,396
Forget the number, Chief.

1804
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:18,316
We ain't gonna find nothing
out there tonight.

1805
01:52:21,653 --> 01:52:22,821
Shit.

1806
01:52:37,168 --> 01:52:38,169
Ton?

1807
01:52:39,045 --> 01:52:40,421
Hey, Tony!

1808
01:53:52,952 --> 01:53:56,998
<i>I know your eyes in the morning sun</i>

1809
01:53:57,081 --> 01:54:01,753
<i>I feel you touch me in the pouring rain</i>

1810
01:54:02,003 --> 01:54:06,466
<i>And the moment
That you wander far from me</i>

1811
01:54:06,591 --> 01:54:10,637
<i>I wanna feel you in my arms again</i>

1812
01:54:11,137 --> 01:54:15,683
<i>And you come to me
On a summer breeze</i>

1813
01:54:15,767 --> 01:54:20,521
<i>Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave</i>

1814
01:54:20,605 --> 01:54:23,858
<i>And it's me you need to show</i>

1815
01:54:24,275 --> 01:54:25,985
<i>How deep is your love</i>

1816
01:54:26,110 --> 01:54:30,281
<i>How deep is your love
How deep is your love</i>

1817
01:54:30,365 --> 01:54:34,035
<i>I really need to learn</i>

1818
01:54:34,118 --> 01:54:38,498
<i>'Cause we're living in a world of fools</i>

1819
01:54:38,623 --> 01:54:41,084
<i>Breaking us down</i>

1820
01:54:41,167 --> 01:54:42,627
<i>When they all should let us be</i>

1821
01:54:54,097 --> 01:54:59,060
<i>- Yeah, who is it?</i>
- Stephanie? It's Tony. It's Tony Manero.

1822
01:54:59,143 --> 01:55:02,105
<i>Just get the hell out of here, please.</i>

1823
01:55:02,188 --> 01:55:06,234
- Could I just talk to you for a minute?
<i>- Talk to me? What, are you kidding?</i>

1824
01:55:06,317 --> 01:55:10,655
No, I mean it. I just want
to talk to you for a second, all right?

1825
01:55:10,738 --> 01:55:13,574
<i>- I'm gonna call the cops.</i>
- No, don't call the cops, Stephanie.

1826
01:55:13,658 --> 01:55:15,660
I just need to talk to you.

1827
01:55:15,743 --> 01:55:18,037
<i>Would you just
get away from here, okay?</i>

1828
01:55:18,121 --> 01:55:23,001
Come on, Steph,
I came in from Brooklyn. I just got in.

1829
01:55:27,005 --> 01:55:29,007
Steph, can you please?

1830
01:55:34,846 --> 01:55:37,890
Stephanie! Come on!

1831
01:55:47,525 --> 01:55:48,901
Stephanie?

1832
01:55:51,654 --> 01:55:54,282
- Is that you?
- Yeah, it's me, Stephanie.

1833
01:55:54,365 --> 01:55:56,534
Hey, look, look,
I'm really sorry about last night.

1834
01:55:56,617 --> 01:55:59,954
- You're sorry?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Stephanie. I just...

1835
01:56:00,038 --> 01:56:02,749
Look, it won't happen again,
I promise you.

1836
01:56:02,832 --> 01:56:04,751
I just... I just, I really need to talk to you.

1837
01:56:04,834 --> 01:56:07,628
What are you talking about,
you need to talk to me?

1838
01:56:07,712 --> 01:56:10,631
It's just like what I said.
I need to talk to you.

1839
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,635
Okay, listen. Now, if I open this door,

1840
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:16,971
you're not gonna pull
any funny stuff on me, right?

1841
01:56:17,055 --> 01:56:18,848
No, of course not.

1842
01:56:30,193 --> 01:56:32,904
First time I ever let a known rapist
in my apartment.

1843
01:56:32,987 --> 01:56:35,990
Hey, look, I'll just stay right here,
all right?

1844
01:56:36,074 --> 01:56:40,369
So, that way you don't think that I'm
gonna, you know, jump you or nothing.

1845
01:56:43,247 --> 01:56:45,416
What's wrong with you, man?

1846
01:56:49,587 --> 01:56:51,756
Nothing. I'll tell you later. Right?

1847
01:56:53,925 --> 01:56:57,720
Well, you can't just stand there.
This is ridiculous. Come on.

1848
01:57:00,932 --> 01:57:03,434
I've been up all night
just walking and looking around.

1849
01:57:03,559 --> 01:57:06,687
And, you know,
I'm gonna get myself my own place.

1850
01:57:06,771 --> 01:57:08,022
You know what I'm gonna do?

1851
01:57:08,106 --> 01:57:09,774
I'm getting my money,
I'm coming back, you know.

1852
01:57:09,857 --> 01:57:11,109
'Cause I ain't going back there.

1853
01:57:11,192 --> 01:57:14,570
Wait a minute. Why don't you sit down,
okay? Come on.

1854
01:57:18,282 --> 01:57:19,283
So, what are you doing?

1855
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:21,160
What am I doing?

1856
01:57:21,244 --> 01:57:24,539
I'm just not going back there, that's all.
They're assholes back there.

1857
01:57:24,622 --> 01:57:26,874
- I'm fed up to here with it. It's bullshit.
- Okay. Okay.

1858
01:57:26,958 --> 01:57:28,751
What are you gonna do?

1859
01:57:28,835 --> 01:57:30,962
What do you do?
You come in. You get a job. You know.

1860
01:57:31,045 --> 01:57:33,005
Do what you do. Get a nice apartment.

1861
01:57:33,089 --> 01:57:35,216
Okay, what kind of job?

1862
01:57:37,009 --> 01:57:38,845
I don't know.

1863
01:57:38,928 --> 01:57:41,013
What did you do? You came in,
you couldn't do nothing, right?

1864
01:57:41,097 --> 01:57:43,266
I could type when I came.

1865
01:57:45,518 --> 01:57:48,938
No big deal. I'm an able person.
I mean, I can do these things.

1866
01:57:49,021 --> 01:57:51,065
Yeah, of course you can.

1867
01:57:53,401 --> 01:57:55,987
Tony, I wanna tell you something.

1868
01:57:56,904 --> 01:58:00,241
Now, you know, I said
all that stuff to you about...

1869
01:58:01,159 --> 01:58:04,537
Using you,
practicing my act on you, you know?

1870
01:58:05,163 --> 01:58:06,664
It wasn't true.

1871
01:58:06,747 --> 01:58:10,001
There's a lot of other reasons
that I was hanging around you.

1872
01:58:10,084 --> 01:58:13,337
- What do you mean?
- You made me feel better.

1873
01:58:14,922 --> 01:58:18,301
You gave me, like, admiration,
you know? Respect.

1874
01:58:19,385 --> 01:58:20,720
Support.

1875
01:58:25,266 --> 01:58:29,604
Stephanie, maybe now that, you know,
like, I'm gonna be in town like I planned,

1876
01:58:29,687 --> 01:58:32,440
maybe, like, we could see each other.

1877
01:58:33,733 --> 01:58:36,903
No, I don't mean like that.
I know what you're thinking.

1878
01:58:36,986 --> 01:58:39,780
You're thinking, like,
I'm promoting your pussy, but I ain't.

1879
01:58:39,864 --> 01:58:41,574
I mean, like, friends, right?

1880
01:58:41,657 --> 01:58:44,869
You know, like you once said,
we could help each other.

1881
01:58:44,952 --> 01:58:48,748
- Wanna be friends?
- Yeah. I'd like to be friends with you.

1882
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,461
Think you know how, huh?

1883
01:58:53,544 --> 01:58:55,296
Think you could be friends with a girl?

1884
01:58:55,379 --> 01:58:58,341
Could you stand
being friends with a girl, huh?

1885
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,676
- The truth?
- Yeah.

1886
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:01,802
I don't know.

1887
01:59:03,179 --> 01:59:04,305
I don't know. I mean, I could try.

1888
01:59:04,388 --> 01:59:07,225
That's all I can say, Stephanie.
I could try.

1889
01:59:13,314 --> 01:59:15,358
Okay. Okay.

1890
01:59:16,442 --> 01:59:19,737
Let's be friends, all right?
We'll just be friends.

1891
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:22,406
All right.

1892
01:59:23,491 --> 01:59:24,575
Okay.

1893
01:59:29,205 --> 01:59:30,706
Friends, man.

1894
01:59:31,958 --> 01:59:36,087
<i>I know your eyes in the morning sun</i>

1895
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:39,882
<i>I feel you touch me in the pouring rain</i>

1896
01:59:41,175 --> 01:59:45,763
<i>And the moment
That you wander far from me</i>

1897
01:59:45,846 --> 01:59:50,309
<i>I wanna feel you in my arms again</i>

1898
01:59:50,393 --> 01:59:54,814
<i>And you come to me
On a summer breeze</i>

1899
01:59:54,897 --> 01:59:59,527
<i>Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave</i>

1900
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:03,447
<i>And it's me you need to show</i>

1901
02:00:03,531 --> 02:00:04,907
<i>How deep is your love</i>

1902
02:00:04,991 --> 02:00:09,453
<i>How deep is your love
How deep is your love</i>

1903
02:00:09,537 --> 02:00:12,999
<i>I really need to learn</i>

1904
02:00:13,082 --> 02:00:17,503
<i>'Cause we're living in a world of fools</i>

1905
02:00:17,586 --> 02:00:20,339
<i>Breaking us down</i>

1906
02:00:20,423 --> 02:00:24,010
<i>When they all should let us be</i>

1907
02:00:24,927 --> 02:00:28,681
<i>We belong to you and me</i>

1908
02:00:28,764 --> 02:00:31,225
<i>I believe in you</i>

1909
02:00:31,309 --> 02:00:36,230
<i>You know the door to my very soul</i>

1910
02:00:36,397 --> 02:00:40,985
<i>You're the light
In my deepest, darkest hour</i>

1911
02:00:41,110 --> 02:00:44,864
<i>You're my savior when I fall</i>

1912
02:00:45,781 --> 02:00:50,202
<i>And you may not think
I care for you</i>

1913
02:00:50,286 --> 02:00:54,999
<i>When you know down inside
That I really do</i>

1914
02:00:55,082 --> 02:00:58,586
<i>And it's me you need to show</i>

1915
02:00:59,003 --> 02:01:00,338
<i>How deep is your love</i>

1916
02:01:00,421 --> 02:01:04,842
<i>How deep is your love
How deep is your love</i>

1917
02:01:04,925 --> 02:01:07,386
<i>Well, you can tell
By the way I use my walk</i>

1918
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:09,889
<i>I'm a woman's man
No time to talk</i>

1919
02:01:09,972 --> 02:01:11,974
<i>Music loud
And women warm</i>

1920
02:01:12,058 --> 02:01:14,602
<i>I've been kicked around
Since I was born</i>

1921
02:01:14,685 --> 02:01:16,896
<i>And now it's all right
It's okay</i>

1922
02:01:16,979 --> 02:01:19,398
<i>You may look the other way</i>

1923
02:01:19,482 --> 02:01:21,776
<i>And we can try
To understand</i>

1924
02:01:21,859 --> 02:01:24,111
<i>The</i> New York Times' <i>effect on man</i>

1925
02:01:24,195 --> 02:01:26,280
<i>Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother</i>

1926
02:01:26,364 --> 02:01:28,824
<i>You're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive</i>

1927
02:01:28,908 --> 02:01:30,951
<i>Feel the city breaking
And everybody shaking</i>

1928
02:01:31,035 --> 02:01:33,412
<i>And we're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive</i>

1929
02:01:35,623 --> 02:01:38,084
<i>Stayin' alive
Stayin' alive</i>

1930
02:01:40,628 --> 02:01:47,176
<i>Stayin' alive</i>

1931
02:01:54,058 --> 02:01:56,644
<i>Well, now, I get low
And I get high</i>

1932
02:01:56,727 --> 02:01:59,105
<i>And if I can't get either
I really try</i>

1933
02:01:59,188 --> 02:02:01,148
<i>Got the wings of heaven
On my shoes</i>

1934
02:02:01,232 --> 02:02:03,651
<i>I'm a dancing man
And I just can't lose</i>

1935
02:02:03,734 --> 02:02:05,945
<i>You know it's all right
It's okay</i>

1936
02:02:06,028 --> 02:02:08,447
<i>I'll live to see another day</i>

1937
02:02:08,531 --> 02:02:10,616
