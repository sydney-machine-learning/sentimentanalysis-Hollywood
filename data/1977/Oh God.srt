1
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:56,925
- Jer, clean or dirty?
- Marginal.

2
00:01:57,836 --> 00:01:59,360
No, it's not.

3
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,508
I don't know why you use that thing.
I mean, if it's for me, it's not necessary.

4
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:14,479
- Of course, I do like to watch you use it.
- I know.

5
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:20,284
Listen, I think we should wait
with the powder room.

6
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:22,553
Nope, no more waiting for toilets.

7
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:27,654
I just don't like to see you worrying
about loans and mortgages, that's all.

8
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:29,324
Then don't look.

9
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:34,596
I don't think we should spend money...

10
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:36,902
No more thinking tonight! Let's watch TV.

11
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:41,406
Is there any good mail today?

12
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,846
A couple of junk, some bills,
and a letter for you.

13
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:57,990
Read this.

14
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:02,557
"God grants you an interview.

15
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:05,068
"1600 North Hope Street,
Los Angeles, California.

16
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:08,765
"Room 2700. Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m."

17
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,109
It's a gag.

18
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:16,672
No stamp, no return address?
Pretty crazy gag.

19
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:20,013
- It's an ad.
- For what?

20
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:25,178
For God oven cleaner, or God detergent,
or I don't know.

21
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:26,814
Nobody would dare.

22
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:38,163
Air ball.

23
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:41,270
Artie Coogan.

24
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:45,101
- What?
- Artie Coogan, that's it.

25
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:46,436
Yeah.

26
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:49,043
Crazy Artie.

27
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:52,344
No, an English teacher
wouldn't misspell "interview."

28
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:55,813
Neither would God.

29
00:03:56,988 --> 00:04:01,049
I can't meet him tomorrow. I've got
to meet the District Produce Manager.

30
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,093
- Sorry, God.
- Two points.

31
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,594
Did we make love last night?

32
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:16,796
Just checking.

33
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,032
Keep checking.

34
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,377
I love you.

35
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:44,497
Honey, it's so late.

36
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,043
That was two points.

37
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:58,908
- Wash your hands, Norman.
- We were just...

38
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:01,604
Good morning, Mr. McCarthy.
I'm sorry to be late, sir.

39
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:03,670
Landers. Hold it.

40
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:09,751
Is this how you've instructed your staff
to prepare romaine lettuce for display?

41
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:13,052
I know what you're getting at,
and I had the same argument...

42
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:16,116
- with the last district manager.
- Please answer.

43
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,161
Yes, I do.

44
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:25,730
Why would anyone buy that...

45
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:29,762
when they could get this
for the same price?

46
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:35,301
Mr. McCarthy, if I put this head of lettuce in
the bin, it's going to stay there all day...

47
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,904
it'll be there tomorrow and the next day...

48
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,007
and we will wind up throwing it away.

49
00:06:40,084 --> 00:06:41,142
Our other stores...

50
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:44,245
They do not have a Ralph's up the street
and a Lucky Market...

51
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:47,086
right around the corner
who trim even closer than I do.

52
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,752
Now, I know my customers, Mr. McCarthy.

53
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:52,790
I see.

54
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:05,869
Landers?

55
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:10,177
I also noticed that you haven't been
oiling your cukes.

56
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:13,977
- What?
- Why haven't you been oiling your cukes?

57
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:20,650
It takes time, it takes oil,
it's dishonest, Mr. McCarthy.

58
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:23,694
- Dishonest?
- Sir, there's an interview that I...

59
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:26,696
Look, our company has
certain policies, which...

60
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:28,561
I have an interview with...

61
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:29,725
You have a what?

62
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:33,561
Thank you very much.

63
00:08:58,489 --> 00:08:59,717
<i>Stay.</i>

64
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:03,490
What is this?

65
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:08,021
<i>You're right on time, I like that.
Close the door.</i>

66
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:13,601
- Who are you?
<i>- You read the note.</i>

67
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:19,039
- Who is that, Artie?
<i>- God.</i>

68
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,107
- Come on, Artie.
<i>- No, it's me, God.</i>

69
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:26,248
- God?
<i>- Right, God.</i>

70
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:29,449
<i>God Almighty, Big "G".</i>

71
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:39,823
<i>It's not a gag, I promise.</i>

72
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:46,234
<i>- Where you going?</i>
- I've got this load of plums coming in.

73
00:09:46,304 --> 00:09:49,501
<i>Let the plums wait.
How often do you talk with God?</i>

74
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:53,301
Practically never.

75
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,345
How do I know you're God?
All I hear is a voice on an intercom.

76
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:05,582
<i>You're not allowed to see me.</i>

77
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:08,091
- Why not?
<i>- Because.</i>

78
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,325
- That's no answer.
<i>- Sue me.</i>

79
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:15,089
- If you're God...
<i>- Yeah?</i>

80
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,328
- If you're really God...
<i>- Yeah?</i>

81
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:23,305
<i>If I'm really God, what?</i>

82
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,774
<i>- You leaving?</i>
- Right the first time.

83
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:32,372
<i>Where are you leaving?
Where do you think you are?</i>

84
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,317
What do you mean, where?
Right here is where, that's where.

85
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:40,153
<i>- And where is here?</i>
- 1600 North Hope Street, Room 2700.

86
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,755
<i>Jerry.</i>

87
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,657
<i>There's no Room 2700 in this building.</i>

88
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:49,893
<i>There's no 27th floor here.</i>

89
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:56,496
<i>I thought, this way
we'd have a little privacy.</i>

90
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:59,465
<i>Check it out, Go ahead, I'll wait.</i>

91
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,632
- Sir?
- Yes, sir?

92
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:29,332
How do I get to the 27th floor?

93
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,704
- In this building?
- Yeah.

94
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:34,438
I'm afraid you'd need a can opener.
We only have 17 floors.

95
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:37,978
Seventeen.

96
00:12:56,393 --> 00:12:58,020
<i>Have a nice ride?</i>

97
00:12:58,696 --> 00:12:59,924
<i>Come in.</i>

98
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,256
<i>Close the door.</i>

99
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,168
<i>Sit down.</i>

100
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:23,750
<i>Go ahead.</i>

101
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:29,952
<i>Relax.</i>

102
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:32,994
<i>Don't smoke.</i>

103
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:35,798
- I don't.
<i>- Good.</i>

104
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,325
<i>Tobacco was one of my big mistakes.</i>

105
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:41,998
- Mistakes?
<i>- You try.</i>

106
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,909
<i>Ostriches were a mistake.
Silly looking things, Avocados.</i>

107
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:52,142
<i>Made the pit too big, Like I say, "You try."</i>

108
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:56,578
<i>You still don't believe it?</i>

109
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,482
Artie, if this is you, you win.

110
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:05,220
- This is the best gag you've ever pulled.
<i>- I'm not Artie.</i>

111
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:09,027
<i>Went to a lot of trouble to make it
a comfortable interview.</i>

112
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:10,990
You misspelled it, you know.

113
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,797
<i>- What?</i>
- "Interview."

114
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,267
In your note.

115
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,975
It's "I"...

116
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:23,138
It's "I" before "E."

117
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:28,308
<i>Give me a break, A few things, I got right.
I put summer before winter, didn't I?</i>

118
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:32,522
<i>You're scared.</i>

119
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:36,155
Well, sure. But look, if this is a joke,
it's gone too far.

120
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:37,693
<i>It's no joke.</i>

121
00:14:38,362 --> 00:14:42,856
How come you've got such a...
Just a voice, like everybody's?

122
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,533
<i>Empathy, I'm talking to you
in a way you can accept.</i>

123
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,360
<i>I'm relating.</i>

124
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,405
<i>I don't like to brag,
but if I appeared to you just as God...</i>

125
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:56,435
<i>how I really am, what I really am,
your mind couldn't grasp it.</i>

126
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:59,816
I think you made a mistake.
I'm not religious.

127
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:01,009
<i>So?</i>

128
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:05,419
I'm not one of your believers.
And I sure as heck don't believe this.

129
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,890
<i>That's why I showed up.
Too many nonbelievers.</i>

130
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,887
But I read in an article
that religion is on the upswing.

131
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:17,730
<i>Religion is easy, I'm talking about faith.
You're going to help me change that.</i>

132
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:19,402
Me?

133
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,962
- I don't belong to any church.
<i>- Neither do I.</i>

134
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:27,040
<i>Go back to work.
I don't want you to get in trouble.</i>

135
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:29,410
Thank you.

136
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,215
<i>We'll talk on the way.</i>

137
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:36,250
- How?
<i>- Trust me, Like it says on the money.</i>

138
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,831
Sir? Are you all right, sir?

139
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,270
No.

140
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:02,138
<i>Jerry.</i>

141
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,714
<i>- You want me to talk louder?</i>
- Oh, God.

142
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:13,078
<i>I thought you didn't believe in me?</i>

143
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:15,625
That's just an expression.

144
00:16:15,693 --> 00:16:18,628
<i>I'm more than that,
and I want you to spread the word.</i>

145
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:19,822
Me?

146
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:23,863
- Spread what word?
<i>- That I am, I exist.</i>

147
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:26,300
<i>That we've spoken.</i>

148
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:30,638
You want me to tell people
that I've spoken with God?

149
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:33,239
<i>- Yes.</i>
- They'll put me away.

150
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,676
<i>I'm tired of all the talk that I may be dead,
or that I never was at all.</i>

151
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:41,548
<i>Or that God was just
particles of cosmos, Gas.</i>

152
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:45,217
<i>I'm not gas, I found that very insulting.</i>

153
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:50,626
- Do you actually expect people to believe...
<i>- That's your job.</i>

154
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:55,896
But I'm just a man. I'm no Moses.

155
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:59,629
<i>What was Moses?
Do you think Moses was born on Page 1?</i>

156
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,201
<i>Moses was just a messenger, my messenger.</i>

157
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:09,208
Look...

158
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:11,772
God, if...

159
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:16,875
If I tell people
that I spoke with God, they...

160
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:26,925
<i>And now an oldie but a goodie,</i>
<i>Jerry Gray and</i> A String of Pearls,

161
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,566
God?

162
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,872
<i>Top-ten time on KGOD, What is it, Jerry?</i>

163
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,410
That guy on the motorcycle thinks
I'm a nut. Is that the kind of God you are?

164
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,616
- How come you didn't let him hear you?
<i>- That's a policy of mine.</i>

165
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:57,922
<i>I try not to work with
more than one savior at a time.</i>

166
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,259
Savior? Me?

167
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:05,925
<i>- You do your job right...</i>
- I can't take this job. I don't believe...

168
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:10,370
<i>I know, but even nonbelievers want
what they've got down here to work.</i>

169
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:14,741
Have you read the papers lately?
It ain't working.

170
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:19,309
<i>That's why I came, to tell everybody
I set the world up so it can work.</i>

171
00:18:19,383 --> 00:18:23,080
<i>Only, it's up to you.
You can't look to me to do it for you.</i>

172
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,344
No.

173
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:28,017
<i>You can do it, It's only one message.</i>

174
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:31,720
<i>- Moses had to handle ten.</i>
- But you gave him tablets.

175
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:34,696
<i>- He had a bad memory.</i>
- I need something.

176
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:36,832
<i>What kind of something?</i>

177
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:41,730
I don't know. Anything. A tape recording.

178
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:45,965
<i>My voice wouldn't come out on tape.
It's very complicated.</i>

179
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:50,403
<i>It's like, you know how Dracula
can't see himself in a mirror?</i>

180
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,412
<i>It's along those lines.</i>

181
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:55,677
If people could just hear your voice...

182
00:18:55,752 --> 00:19:00,382
<i>This isn't even how I sound, I'm talking
like this so that you'll understand me.</i>

183
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:03,722
Understand? I don't understand anything.

184
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:06,622
<i>That's a beginning, Over and out.</i>

185
00:19:07,598 --> 00:19:10,328
Hold it. Don't hang up on me.

186
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,061
<i>You just went through a red light.
You're going to get yourself killed.</i>

187
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:15,536
<i>I need you down here.</i>

188
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:24,903
I have some nice, fresh chicken soup.
Why don't you let me fix you a bowl?

189
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,193
Is that all I can get from you? Soup?

190
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:48,366
- You know what, darling?
- What?

191
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,473
Why don't you and I take a few days off
and go on a little holiday?

192
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:58,444
- A holiday?
- Yeah.

193
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:02,277
We could go to San Francisco.

194
00:20:03,153 --> 00:20:06,316
You haven't even seen
your sister's new baby yet.

195
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:13,555
You don't want me to see my sister's baby.
You want me to see my sister's husband.

196
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,623
I am not crazy, and I don't need
some child psychiatrist to tell me...

197
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:20,602
that I didn't talk to God, because I did.

198
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:27,443
- On an intercom.
- And on the car radio.

199
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:31,846
Yes, Jerry.

200
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:36,216
Do you remember when Artie Coogan
set up that hidden microphone...

201
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:39,949
and he broadcast those filthy limericks
through the television set?

202
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:41,854
It was not Artie.

203
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,586
I know all of Artie's voices.

204
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:49,325
Artie is not capable of adding 10 stories
to a building that doesn't have them.

205
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:52,095
He cannot talk back and forth
through a car radio...

206
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:54,069
that's been busted for two months.

207
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:57,573
Whoever the hell this guy is,
he's very smart.

208
00:20:58,075 --> 00:20:59,940
And I'm going to listen to him.

209
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:03,946
- For a while.
- And you think it's God?

210
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:09,044
Well, he thinks he's God.
And I'm in no position to argue with him.

211
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:15,747
- I thought you believed in him.
- I do. I believe in God.

212
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:19,091
I just don't believe that he exists.
I mean, in the sense...

213
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:24,122
that he repaints floor numbers in office
buildings or doubles as a disc jockey.

214
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,593
Well, that is what he does.

215
00:21:28,238 --> 00:21:30,968
And he wants you
to give his message to the world?

216
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,099
Yes.

217
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:36,540
Jerry, does he know how you feel about him?

218
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,916
I told him. Doesn't seem to bother him.

219
00:21:44,588 --> 00:21:47,113
So is that all he told you?

220
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:49,658
That you're going to be the savior?

221
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:53,719
And that to tell everybody,
what we have down here can work?

222
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:55,097
Yes.

223
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:58,430
He also told me,
he's very disappointed in avocados.

224
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:02,668
- He is?
- He said he made the pit too big.

225
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:08,401
I am not crazy!

226
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:12,375
Jerry?

227
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:24,516
I let you sleep a little later.

228
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:27,196
I'll take the kids to school, okay?

229
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:32,858
How do you feel?

230
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:36,036
You know, about...

231
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:43,769
I almost forgot. I'm fine.

232
00:22:47,317 --> 00:22:48,477
Good.

233
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:51,912
Because, you know, I was thinking...

234
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:55,321
you didn't actually see,
all you did was hear.

235
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,994
And you know what they say.

236
00:22:58,061 --> 00:23:00,928
- What?
- Seeing is believing.

237
00:23:01,498 --> 00:23:02,726
Not hearing.

238
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:07,433
- What about Ingrid Bergman?
- Ingrid Bergman?

239
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,673
Joan of Arc. She played Joan of Arc.

240
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:15,743
Joan of Arc.

241
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:21,477
Joan didn't see either.
She just heard, like me.

242
00:23:32,095 --> 00:23:33,289
<i>Jerry?</i>

243
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:39,592
- Oh, God.
<i>- That's right.</i>

244
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,437
- Is that you?
<i>- In person.</i>

245
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:51,736
- You're not on the radio?
<i>- Have you got a radio out here?</i>

246
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:54,343
- No.
<i>- Bingo.</i>

247
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:56,443
You're here?

248
00:23:58,822 --> 00:24:01,450
- In my bathroom?
<i>- Come take a look.</i>

249
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:07,286
- I can't. I'm naked.
<i>- You think I don't know what you've got?</i>

250
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:10,896
That was another little goof of mine.
Shame.

251
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:14,062
<i>I don't know why I thought we needed shame.</i>

252
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:16,537
<i>Come on out.</i>

253
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:31,010
<i>Don't catch cold.</i>

254
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:41,153
Not what you expected?

255
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:49,595
I picked a look you could understand.

256
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:51,698
For someone else,
I would've looked different.

257
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:55,973
I could do any face, voice, whatever.
I could even be a woman.

258
00:24:57,781 --> 00:25:01,410
- Feeling a little strange?
- Very strange.

259
00:25:01,618 --> 00:25:03,586
Like you're going to faint?

260
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:07,182
You know what's good for that?

261
00:25:07,857 --> 00:25:08,857
Shaving.

262
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:12,784
- Shaving?
- Sometimes when you don't feel normal...

263
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:15,387
doing a normal thing makes you feel normal.

264
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:16,659
Here, start shaving.

265
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:36,982
Go ahead.

266
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
I am.

267
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:39,946
I don't mean with the shaving...

268
00:25:40,023 --> 00:25:42,651
with the questions
that are popping into your head.

269
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:46,153
Yeah.

270
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:51,323
- Why me?
- Why not you?

271
00:25:52,602 --> 00:25:54,194
You mean, there's no special...

272
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:58,105
Life is a crap shoot, like the millionth
customer who crosses a bridge...

273
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:00,404
gets to shake hands with the governor.

274
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:03,613
You thought I picked you
because you're better than everybody?

275
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
I'm not?

276
00:26:04,748 --> 00:26:07,046
You're better than some,
but not as good as others.

277
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:09,347
But you crossed the bridge
at the right time.

278
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:14,186
If you wanted to see me,
why didn't you just appear over my bed?

279
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:17,917
Hollywood. Next question.

280
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:29,233
People are always praying to you.
Do you listen?

281
00:26:30,073 --> 00:26:33,008
I can't help hearing. I don't always listen.

282
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:36,206
- Then you don't care?
- Of course I care.

283
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:38,945
I care plenty. But what can I do?

284
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,006
What can you do?

285
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:42,909
You're God.

286
00:26:42,986 --> 00:26:46,217
Only for the big picture.
I don't get into details.

287
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:48,757
Then whatever happens to us...

288
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,656
Happens. Here, I put in a new blade.

289
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:55,696
You mean, there's no plan...

290
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:59,030
no scheme to guide our destinies?

291
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:04,133
- A lot of it is luck.
- Luck? Just luck?

292
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:09,207
Put on a little toilet paper.
I'll get you a piece.

293
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:17,085
- You don't control our lives?
- I gave you a world and everything in it.

294
00:27:17,654 --> 00:27:19,451
It's all up to you.

295
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:24,391
- But we need help.
- That's why I gave you each other. Here.

296
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:30,260
With your powers,
you could solve so many problems.

297
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:33,067
Don't wet it.

298
00:27:34,437 --> 00:27:36,564
- Are you sure?
- Am I sure?

299
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:39,473
Did I do a good job on the Grand Canyon?

300
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,275
Anyway, why don't you?
Solve all our problems.

301
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:51,648
- Work a few miracles.
- I don't do miracles. They're too flashy.

302
00:27:51,988 --> 00:27:54,047
And they upset the natural balance.

303
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:57,657
No miracles? I knew it.

304
00:27:58,661 --> 00:28:01,494
Maybe now and then,
just to keep my hand in.

305
00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:04,829
The last miracle I did was the 1969 Mets.

306
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:08,732
Before that,
I think you have to go back to the Red Sea.

307
00:28:09,172 --> 00:28:10,696
That was a beauty.

308
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:14,671
No offense,
but I don't believe the Red Sea...

309
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:17,907
and I don't believe
six days to create the world.

310
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,445
You're right.

311
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,444
- I am?
- Tell you the truth...

312
00:28:21,518 --> 00:28:25,215
I thought about it for five days
and did the whole job in one.

313
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,153
I'm really best under pressure.

314
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:32,587
- One day to create the world?
- And the sun. I hate to work in the dark.

315
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:34,427
You have to remember...

316
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:37,796
that one of my days
is not exactly one of yours.

317
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:38,891
How long are they?

318
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:42,404
When I got up this morning,
Sigmund Freud was still in medical school.

319
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:52,177
- If you're so involved with us...
- Yeah?

320
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:56,016
How can you permit all the suffering
that goes on in the world?

321
00:28:57,287 --> 00:28:59,778
- How can I permit the suffering?
- Yeah.

322
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:02,347
I don't permit the suffering. You do.

323
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:05,326
Free will. All the choices are yours.

324
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:08,096
Choices? What choices?

325
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:12,700
You can love, cherish and nurture
each other, or you can kill each other.

326
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:16,671
Incidentally, "kill" is the word.
It's not "waste."

327
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,667
If I meant "waste," I would have written,
"Thou shalt not waste."

328
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:23,473
You're doing some very funny things
with words here.

329
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:28,347
You're also turning the sky into mud.
I look down, I don't believe the filth.

330
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:32,379
Using rivers for toilets,
poisoning my fishes.

331
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:37,455
You want a miracle?
You make a fish from scratch. You can't.

332
00:29:37,727 --> 00:29:41,788
You think only God can make a tree?
Try coming up with a mackerel.

333
00:29:42,332 --> 00:29:44,994
And when the last one is gone,
that'll be that.

334
00:29:45,134 --> 00:29:50,128
Eighty-six on the fishes. Good-bye, sky.
So long, world. Over and out.

335
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,701
- I thought you said we would make it.
- I said, you have to make it work.

336
00:29:55,512 --> 00:29:57,844
- You don't care.
- I do care.

337
00:29:58,081 --> 00:30:02,711
- Then do something about it.
- I did. I got you to carry the ball.

338
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:10,048
- I got no ball. How can I carry it?
- I gave you a mouth, didn't I?

339
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,154
Tell people how I feel, what I said.

340
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:16,062
How do I do that?

341
00:30:16,132 --> 00:30:18,566
How did you get to be an assistant manager?

342
00:30:18,635 --> 00:30:21,627
Did you ever hear of newspapers, reporters?

343
00:30:22,105 --> 00:30:26,269
You got a scoop here, an exclusive,
a hold-the-presses.

344
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:27,767
Fine.

345
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:33,779
And how do I convince anybody
that I've actually seen you?

346
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,546
- That you exist?
- Simple.

347
00:30:39,122 --> 00:30:40,282
Show them this.

348
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:55,630
- Your card?
- No, it's not my card. It's God's card.

349
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:58,632
- It's God's card?
- Look at it.

350
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:00,168
I am.

351
00:31:01,377 --> 00:31:04,608
- Do you know where I got it?
- At a novelty store?

352
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:08,248
- God gave it to me.
- Did he?

353
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:14,222
- May I ask when and where you got it?
- This morning, in my bathroom.

354
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:17,953
God visited you in your bathroom
this morning?

355
00:31:18,027 --> 00:31:19,153
Yes.

356
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:22,795
Sounds crazy to you, doesn't it?

357
00:31:23,232 --> 00:31:26,224
Yesterday,
he was just a voice on an intercom...

358
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:28,532
and then he was on the radio.

359
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:31,839
- God spoke to you on the radio?
- In my car.

360
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:33,703
- What station?
- All stations.

361
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:38,270
Right. And then this morning,
he showed up in your bathroom?

362
00:31:38,681 --> 00:31:39,739
Yes.

363
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:44,779
Why do you suppose
the Almighty spoke to you, Mr...

364
00:31:44,854 --> 00:31:46,845
- Landers.
- Mr. Landers.

365
00:31:46,923 --> 00:31:51,326
Jerry Landers. He said that he wanted
me to be his messenger, like Moses.

366
00:31:53,396 --> 00:31:56,388
What sort of work do you do, Mr. Landers?

367
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:59,401
I'm the assistant manager
of Food World in Burbank.

368
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:03,528
I see. Then you don't speak
to God every day.

369
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:06,107
Never before yesterday.

370
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:14,547
Did God say why he needed a messenger...

371
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:19,281
- at this particular time, Mr. Landers?
- Yes, he was very specific.

372
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,954
He said that he wanted us to know
that it can work.

373
00:32:25,428 --> 00:32:28,090
- What "it" is that?
- Us "it."

374
00:32:28,464 --> 00:32:31,797
Our lives, our world, everything.

375
00:32:32,402 --> 00:32:37,135
He says that he's given us everything
that we need, and it's entirely up to us.

376
00:32:37,273 --> 00:32:41,266
- And those were his exact words?
- Close enough. You can print that.

377
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:44,938
Did God specify the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>?

378
00:32:45,915 --> 00:32:47,746
That was my idea.

379
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:50,609
Well, we're very grateful.

380
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,347
I'm not a nut.

381
00:32:54,457 --> 00:32:57,290
- I didn't say that you were.
- I'm not even religious.

382
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:01,423
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Landers,
for bringing us this story.

383
00:33:01,497 --> 00:33:03,522
Look, don't brush me off.

384
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:08,335
Do me a favor, and look at that card again.
Take a good hard look at it.

385
00:33:08,705 --> 00:33:09,933
Certainly.

386
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:16,373
Now, does that look like something
I'd get at a novelty shop?

387
00:33:16,813 --> 00:33:17,871
Yes.

388
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:39,660
Norman, did you just put a bag of potatoes
on top of that white bread?

389
00:33:39,736 --> 00:33:41,033
No, sir.

390
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:49,642
- I think you did.
<i>- Mr, Landers, please come to Aisle 10.</i>

391
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:51,407
<i>Aisle 10, please.</i>

392
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:53,875
Did you hear that, Norman?

393
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,714
Yes, never put a bag of potatoes
on top of a white bread.

394
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:59,414
No, the page. I was just paged.
Did you hear that?

395
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:02,253
I didn't hear anything. Did I?

396
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,718
We'll get you a new white bread, ma'am.
Take care of it.

397
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:14,461
God?

398
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:19,672
Chemicals, all chemicals.
Turning kids into garbage cans.

399
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,679
Jerry, I didn't see one word
in the newspapers.

400
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:25,043
Of course not.

401
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:28,606
That guy at the <i>Times</i> kept looking
at me like I was some kind of lunatic.

402
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:29,878
And I felt like one.

403
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:34,221
- Did you show him my card?
- Sure I did.

404
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,748
And he said, "You can get one of those
in any novelty store."

405
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:43,121
Here. You know, I really felt like an idiot.
Please, don't do that to me again.

406
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:47,802
- You said what I said?
- Absolutely.

407
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,062
And they didn't find God's word
fit to print?

408
00:34:51,974 --> 00:34:53,942
Some tough cookies, boy.

409
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:55,668
- Did you get the Coke?
- Yes.

410
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:57,406
I have Cup-a-Soup.

411
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:02,078
- Good morning, Mrs. Levin.
- Hi.

412
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:04,051
- Mrs. Green.
- Hi, Jerry.

413
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:07,012
You know, I'd like you to meet...

414
00:35:12,328 --> 00:35:14,489
- You did it to me again.
- What'd she do?

415
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:17,525
What?

416
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:20,567
Nothing.

417
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,161
- Can I help you ladies?
- No.

418
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,867
- We're all right.
- Yes, thank you.

419
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,204
- What was that all about?
- I don't know.

420
00:35:35,351 --> 00:35:38,809
- Why did you change on me?
- Why did you start to introduce me?

421
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:41,049
I don't want to be
the only guy in the world...

422
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:44,092
Look, I can't make appearances all over.
Don't you understand?

423
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,527
- No, I don't.
- People would drop dead from hysterics.

424
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:50,063
- Mr. Landers?
- This place is too busy.

425
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:52,426
Can you sign this, please?

426
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:54,828
<i>Jerry?</i>

427
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:57,739
<i>Up here.</i>

428
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:02,104
<i>- Let's go for a ride.</i>
- I'll meet you.

429
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:04,806
- Where?
- What? Not you.

430
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:17,249
I can't understand it. Why wouldn't
a religious editor believe you?

431
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,021
Face it, you goofed again,
just like the avocado pit.

432
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,321
You picked the wrong message boy.

433
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:26,334
- You don't believe I'm here, do you?
- No, I don't.

434
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:29,869
Then how do you explain
this conversation we're having?

435
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:32,373
I'm having. I'm dreaming you.

436
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:35,902
And I ought to be real glad
when I wake up, too.

437
00:36:36,312 --> 00:36:38,212
What color are my eyes?

438
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:40,309
My eyes?

439
00:36:42,084 --> 00:36:43,176
Blue.

440
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:44,714
My shirt?

441
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:48,085
Red plaid.
What does that got to do with anything?

442
00:36:48,157 --> 00:36:50,591
- Do you dream in color?
- No.

443
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,059
Bingo, again.

444
00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:55,527
Okay. All right.

445
00:36:56,766 --> 00:36:58,256
You know a lot of things...

446
00:36:58,334 --> 00:37:00,495
and you've been making things happen...

447
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:01,866
but none of it seems...

448
00:37:01,938 --> 00:37:04,304
- Godlike?
- Yeah. Godlike.

449
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:06,375
Now, what, to you, would be Godlike?

450
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:12,907
- Change the weather.
- Special effects?

451
00:37:14,517 --> 00:37:18,283
What would you like?
A little earthquake? Small hurricane?

452
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:20,921
No, I wouldn't want anybody hurt.

453
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:24,822
I was just thinking, maybe,
what about a little rain?

454
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:27,688
- Little rain?
- Yeah. A small shower.

455
00:37:28,297 --> 00:37:30,458
One small shower. You got it.

456
00:37:36,072 --> 00:37:37,539
It's raining.

457
00:37:38,574 --> 00:37:40,201
You made it rain.

458
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:43,907
You didn't even bat an eye.
You didn't lift a finger.

459
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,279
- Rain's not that hard.
- It's unbelievable.

460
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,319
- Would you like it to rain a little harder?
- No, this is fine.

461
00:37:50,386 --> 00:37:53,116
- How about bigger drops?
- No. This is fine.

462
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:55,555
Would you care for a little snow?

463
00:37:55,758 --> 00:37:57,089
I don't believe it.

464
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:04,663
It's not raining outside. It's just in here.

465
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:07,332
Why should I spoil everybody's day?

466
00:38:08,504 --> 00:38:10,995
- This is fantastic.
- Thank you.

467
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:15,337
- It's just like Noah's ark.
- Same thing, without the smell.

468
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:49,066
- What's the problem, officer?
- I was about to ask you.

469
00:38:52,014 --> 00:38:55,643
My radiator must be leaking.
I'm sorry about that.

470
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:05,789
A radiator doesn't hold that much water.

471
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:12,895
I must have driven through a car wash
with my windows open?

472
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:17,099
- That'd do it.
- Yeah.

473
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:23,006
- Roll up the windows next time.
- Yes, sir, I will. Yes, sir.

474
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:25,337
Thank you, sir.

475
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:37,220
- He believed that dumb excuse.
- There's an aura of goodness around you.

476
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,218
You.

477
00:39:40,096 --> 00:39:42,894
Going to try a little harder
to get the word out?

478
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:48,470
- Yeah! I'll give it another shot!
- That's my boy.

479
00:39:49,071 --> 00:39:50,470
Mr. Briggs.

480
00:39:51,674 --> 00:39:53,699
- You're all wet.
- Of course I'm wet.

481
00:39:53,776 --> 00:39:56,973
I didn't dry myself, I wanted you
to see this. Do you remember me?

482
00:39:57,046 --> 00:40:00,709
Of course. You're the nonbeliever
who spoke to God, twice, I believe.

483
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:02,045
Four times, now.

484
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:05,815
- Is he still visiting you in the toilet?
- I just rode with him in my car.

485
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,651
This time, I have got the proof.

486
00:40:07,723 --> 00:40:11,955
- He gave you another calling card?
- No. He made it rain inside the car.

487
00:40:12,294 --> 00:40:15,422
This water that I'm dripping all over here
is water that he made.

488
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,298
This is holy water.

489
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:22,703
- If you'll excuse me, I really am in a hurry.
- I will not excuse you, Mr. Briggs!

490
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:24,864
You are a reporter of religious events...

491
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,398
and this is the most important
religious event of our time.

492
00:40:28,477 --> 00:40:30,138
And I expect you...

493
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:33,144
I don't expect, I insist,
that you print his message...

494
00:40:33,215 --> 00:40:35,979
in your paper and give it
the prominence it deserves.

495
00:40:36,051 --> 00:40:38,611
Or, by God, you'll hear from me again.

496
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:41,749
Jerry.

497
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:45,918
No, listen to this.

498
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:49,929
"It should come as no surprise to anyone
that in these tense-filled times...

499
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:51,967
"religious freaks abound.

500
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,832
"From the Bronx cabbie who claims
he drove Mary Magdalene...

501
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:57,304
"to the airport last
Christmas..." Listen.

502
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:59,898
"To the Burbank, California,
supermarket manager...

503
00:40:59,975 --> 00:41:03,809
"who insists he has had
four conversations with God, no less."

504
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:04,971
What?

505
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:06,912
"According to this second gentleman...

506
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:10,349
"who flashes a calling card
with God's name on it...

507
00:41:10,653 --> 00:41:12,746
"God wants very much for us to know...

508
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:16,416
"He is alive and well and that
our world can work. It's up to us."

509
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:18,050
Let me see that.

510
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,623
The <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.

511
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:23,590
- Where is it?
- How could you, for God's...

512
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:26,499
It's right here, with some terrific company.

513
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:30,535
See this? A janitor who sleeps all night
tied up on a cross.

514
00:41:31,106 --> 00:41:33,131
Did anybody else say they saw God?

515
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:37,612
No, but there's an insurance salesman
selling life-after-death policies.

516
00:41:38,214 --> 00:41:43,208
But only you have talked to the Big Boss.
Did you just say that you saw him?

517
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,715
- Yes.
- You didn't just hear him?

518
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:50,349
One line. That's all
they gave it is one line.

519
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:54,021
- Are you saying now that you saw God?
- Three times, yeah.

520
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:59,364
- Three times?
- In the bathroom, at work, and in the car.

521
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:04,730
One lousy line. I don't believe it.

522
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:16,244
Let's go away for a couple days, okay?

523
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:21,320
- Bobbie, I know how crazy this all sounds.
- No, you don't.

524
00:42:25,894 --> 00:42:28,692
I saw him. He spoke to me.

525
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:33,830
All right, let's say, for a minute,
that you saw God...

526
00:42:33,902 --> 00:42:36,962
Look, don't humor me.
That'll really make me crazy.

527
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:39,803
Okay! You saw him.

528
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:43,843
- But why is he talking to you?
- Why not me?

529
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,608
Why not the Pope, or Billy Graham,
or somebody way up there?

530
00:42:47,683 --> 00:42:50,811
- He doesn't care about religion.
- God doesn't care about religion?

531
00:42:50,886 --> 00:42:52,080
That's what he said.

532
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:55,952
He sure picked a funny business
to go into then, didn't he?

533
00:43:02,097 --> 00:43:03,530
I'm sorry, Jerry.

534
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,166
I can't seem to accept the concept of you...

535
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:18,577
actually having a real, honest-to-God
conversation with God.

536
00:43:19,214 --> 00:43:22,945
I don't understand
why he wanted to talk to you.

537
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:29,854
God, listen to me, this whole thing
is making me nuts now, too.

538
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:31,183
Too?

539
00:43:31,727 --> 00:43:34,560
- You do think I'm crazy.
- No.

540
00:43:36,732 --> 00:43:38,757
I don't think you're crazy.

541
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:41,833
Which is why I think I'm crazy.

542
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:46,667
Bobbie, how can I convince anyone at all,
if I can't convince you?

543
00:43:49,411 --> 00:43:53,142
Jerry, for some reason
that I can't even begin to fathom...

544
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:56,476
you really believe all this stuff,
don't you?

545
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,144
Can't you?

546
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,427
I believe...

547
00:44:07,496 --> 00:44:08,963
that you believe.

548
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:14,331
Which, in some sense,
is the same as believing, I guess, isn't it?

549
00:44:20,876 --> 00:44:23,140
Do you understand what I've said?

550
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,805
Do you have any questions?

551
00:44:30,486 --> 00:44:31,646
Adam?

552
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,683
Sounds pretty bananas, Dad.

553
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:45,795
Hello?

554
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:46,992
Who?

555
00:44:47,836 --> 00:44:49,997
No, he isn't home right now.

556
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,635
No, that's not him.

557
00:44:54,476 --> 00:44:57,070
Yes, you can print that in your paper.

558
00:44:57,146 --> 00:44:59,774
He is definitely not the man
in the <i>Times</i> today.

559
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:02,473
- Can I go now, Dad?
- Sure, Son.

560
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:05,509
I'll meet you.

561
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:09,815
Look, I'm his wife. You can believe me.
Don't call back.

562
00:45:33,782 --> 00:45:37,741
- What do you think?
- Maybe he's going through a stage.

563
00:45:38,353 --> 00:45:40,218
You know, "mentalpause."

564
00:45:40,556 --> 00:45:42,217
That's "menopause."

565
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:45,292
- Yeah, like Grandma.
- I hope.

566
00:45:48,063 --> 00:45:49,655
<i>And finally, this note.</i>

567
00:45:49,731 --> 00:45:53,758
<i>The</i> Los Angeles Sunday Times <i>reports</i>
<i>today that in Tarzana, California...</i>

568
00:45:53,836 --> 00:45:57,363
<i>a supermarket manager, Jerry Landers,
had an alleged conversation...</i>

569
00:45:57,439 --> 00:45:59,532
<i>with someone he claimed was God.</i>

570
00:45:59,608 --> 00:46:02,634
<i>According to the story,
God has appeared on earth to reaffirm...</i>

571
00:46:02,711 --> 00:46:06,169
<i>that He lives and our world can work.
It's up to us.</i>

572
00:46:07,716 --> 00:46:11,015
<i>This reporter would like to hedge his bets
on the outside chance...</i>

573
00:46:11,086 --> 00:46:15,523
<i>that God did make this appearance
and that he just might be tuned to ABC.</i>

574
00:46:15,591 --> 00:46:17,923
<i>We'd like him to know, we did report it.</i>

575
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:20,655
<i>This is Jerry Dunphy.
Thank you and good night.</i>

576
00:46:23,665 --> 00:46:28,432
- Even Moses didn't give his last name.
- That should get the phone ringing.

577
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:36,535
I told you.

578
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:41,276
Hello.

579
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:45,618
Yes, this is Jerry Landers.
It's the <i>Tarzana Daily Review</i>.

580
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:48,113
Yes, I'm the one.

581
00:46:48,757 --> 00:46:50,816
Spoke with him? Absolutely.

582
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,656
About 6 foot, blondish hair...

583
00:46:56,298 --> 00:46:57,458
Oh, him.

584
00:46:58,667 --> 00:47:01,534
About 5' 7", I guess. Gray hair.

585
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:04,103
- I almost forgot my project.
- Jerry.

586
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:07,005
- I'm coming!
- You made the front page.

587
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:08,503
What?

588
00:47:11,947 --> 00:47:14,040
- Everybody, look.
- What?

589
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:20,188
Channel 11? That's the 10:00 news.

590
00:47:23,959 --> 00:47:27,952
- Can we stay up and watch us?
- Jerry, I don't want the kids on TV.

591
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:30,764
Can't be any worse than watching it.

592
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:33,558
Don't worry. Come on, kids.

593
00:47:34,536 --> 00:47:36,094
<i>Hold the cameras.</i>

594
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,799
<i>- Mr, Landers?
- Yes.</i>

595
00:47:40,909 --> 00:47:42,809
<i>Channel 11, 10:00 news.</i>

596
00:47:43,145 --> 00:47:46,205
<i>You're quoted as saying
that you've talked with God, sir?</i>

597
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:47,111
<i>Yes.</i>

598
00:47:47,182 --> 00:47:49,150
<i>- Face to face?
- That's right.</i>

599
00:47:49,217 --> 00:47:50,514
He's a fruitcake.

600
00:47:50,586 --> 00:47:55,114
<i>And you say God wants to affirm he's alive
and he's very disappointed...</i>

601
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:59,149
<i>- with the way we're handling our world?
- That's right.</i>

602
00:48:00,095 --> 00:48:02,996
<i>How are you going to get people
to believe you?</i>

603
00:48:03,098 --> 00:48:05,225
<i>It wasn't my idea.</i>

604
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,792
<i>He picked me.</i>

605
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:12,764
Is God going to reveal himself to you,
as you claim he has?

606
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:15,936
Not as I claim he has. As he has.

607
00:48:17,045 --> 00:48:22,005
I don't know if he'll show up again,
but he gave me his message and...

608
00:48:22,117 --> 00:48:24,745
- Dad. It's 10 to.
- Yes, Adam.

609
00:48:25,988 --> 00:48:27,285
That he exists?

610
00:48:27,356 --> 00:48:31,315
Yes, and that he would like us
to cherish and nurture each other...

611
00:48:31,393 --> 00:48:34,487
<i>- as opposed to killing one another.
- He said that?</i>

612
00:48:35,297 --> 00:48:39,529
<i>Yeah, that he's our shepherd,
and we shall not want.</i>

613
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:43,471
<i>- We can quote you?
- I didn't make that up.</i>

614
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:50,501
<i>For 10:00 news, this is Mario Machado
and the man who talked to God in Tarzana.</i>

615
00:48:52,447 --> 00:48:55,712
<i>The second time,
the first time was in Los Angeles.</i>

616
00:48:57,052 --> 00:48:58,076
<i>I stand corrected.</i>

617
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:04,955
<i>Mr, Landers, please call
Mr, Summers at his office.</i>

618
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,190
<i>Mr, Summers for Mr, Landers.</i>

619
00:49:19,274 --> 00:49:21,071
- Landers.
- Mr. Summers.

620
00:49:21,143 --> 00:49:22,735
Glad you could get here so fast.

621
00:49:22,811 --> 00:49:24,676
- Well, you said...
- Right, have a seat.

622
00:49:24,746 --> 00:49:25,746
Thank you.

623
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:27,840
- How's it going, Landers?
- Fine.

624
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:31,750
- You took over while Slavic is vacationing?
- Yes, sir.

625
00:49:32,354 --> 00:49:35,983
- Think you can handle a store as manager?
- I'm sure I can.

626
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:37,355
Good.

627
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:40,225
- Everything all right at home?
- Wonderful.

628
00:49:40,295 --> 00:49:43,230
The missus? Kids? Adam? Betsy?

629
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:44,356
Becky.

630
00:49:44,433 --> 00:49:48,802
Good, what is this "seeing God" crap
all about?

631
00:49:49,938 --> 00:49:52,998
It's not crap, Mr. Summers. I've seen him.

632
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:57,142
I've heard it all in this chair.

633
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,141
I know what being a manager
can do to a man.

634
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,110
Trouble with books.

635
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:06,945
- Humping check-out girls in the freezer.
- I'm only the assistant.

636
00:50:07,022 --> 00:50:08,455
You can tell me.

637
00:50:08,523 --> 00:50:11,788
There's nothing like that to tell.
I really have seen him.

638
00:50:13,328 --> 00:50:18,288
Landers, the founder and
principal stockholder of Food World...

639
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,497
is a man devoted to prayer.

640
00:50:22,237 --> 00:50:26,105
Lowell Wilson has personally
gotten down on his knees...

641
00:50:26,975 --> 00:50:29,068
with three US Presidents.

642
00:50:29,144 --> 00:50:32,944
He attended prayer breakfasts
and asked for God's blessing...

643
00:50:33,215 --> 00:50:37,447
with the Joint Chiefs of Staff
right in the war room of the Pentagon.

644
00:50:39,054 --> 00:50:43,252
I don't think that Mr. Wilson
is going to take too kindly to the idea...

645
00:50:43,325 --> 00:50:45,589
that one of his employees...

646
00:50:46,228 --> 00:50:50,324
is claiming to have had a personal
audience with the Almighty himself.

647
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:54,663
I should think that he would be very happy
to know that his prayers are heard.

648
00:50:54,736 --> 00:50:57,296
Mr. Wilson has reached
that point in his life...

649
00:50:57,372 --> 00:50:59,704
where he can be sure his prayers are heard.

650
00:50:59,775 --> 00:51:01,743
He doesn't need any help from you.

651
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:04,904
It's not me. I'm just kind of like a Moses.

652
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:10,344
Look, Landers.

653
00:51:11,419 --> 00:51:14,616
I don't want to pump any sunshine
up your skirt...

654
00:51:14,689 --> 00:51:18,625
but you have a future at Food World.
Don't blow it.

655
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:23,588
Now, you just keep your mouth shut,
and stay away from reporters.

656
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:27,967
And if I don't?

657
00:51:29,771 --> 00:51:32,968
God may have been interested in you
as an assistant manager...

658
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:36,738
we'll just see how he feels
about you as a bag stuffer.

659
00:51:40,982 --> 00:51:42,279
Over here!

660
00:51:42,984 --> 00:51:45,612
I thought I'd straighten up a little.

661
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:48,485
The mess people make.

662
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:50,718
Take a seat.

663
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:54,228
It's started?

664
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,963
You said you saw me,
and the pressure started.

665
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:01,298
- Is it going to get any worse?
- How should I know?

666
00:52:02,571 --> 00:52:04,505
What do you mean, how should you know?

667
00:52:04,573 --> 00:52:07,098
- How could I know?
- You know everything.

668
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,768
I only know what is.

669
00:52:09,845 --> 00:52:14,441
Also, I'm very big on what was.
On what isn't yet, I haven't got a clue.

670
00:52:15,116 --> 00:52:17,209
- But when you said...
- Move your foot.

671
00:52:17,285 --> 00:52:18,547
Sit down.

672
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:21,249
When you said everything would work out...

673
00:52:21,323 --> 00:52:23,188
I thought you could tell the future.

674
00:52:23,258 --> 00:52:27,160
Absolutely, I could tell the future,
the minute it becomes the past.

675
00:52:27,229 --> 00:52:31,097
I said, everything could work out,
if that's everybody's choice.

676
00:52:31,299 --> 00:52:34,325
People have to decide
what's to be done with the world.

677
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:37,496
I can't make a personal decision
for everybody.

678
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,770
Why the face? So far, so good.

679
00:52:40,842 --> 00:52:44,175
We hit the papers, a little TV,
we're in business.

680
00:52:45,046 --> 00:52:47,037
I'm liable to lose my job.

681
00:52:47,949 --> 00:52:52,215
Lose a job, save a world. Not a bad deal.

682
00:52:58,059 --> 00:52:59,458
Hey, Adam.

683
00:53:08,203 --> 00:53:11,468
- What are you doing here?
- I got off early from work, Son.

684
00:53:11,539 --> 00:53:13,769
I thought I'd give you a lift home.

685
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:15,833
No thanks, Dad. I'll walk.

686
00:53:16,912 --> 00:53:20,177
- Come on.
- No, I got new tennis shoes on.

687
00:53:20,682 --> 00:53:22,513
I want to break them in.

688
00:53:23,518 --> 00:53:25,076
See you later.

689
00:53:26,755 --> 00:53:28,552
Come on, let's go.

690
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,405
<i>Why wouldn't they be embarrassed?</i>

691
00:53:49,844 --> 00:53:53,575
- Their friends ribbed the hell out of them.
- That's rotten.

692
00:53:54,015 --> 00:53:57,644
They wanted to know if you could
get their test answers from God.

693
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:00,745
And could he do anything
about their little-league team?

694
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,290
They gave them a very rough day.

695
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:06,418
Jerry, what are you going to do
about Mr. Summers?

696
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:09,361
What can I do?
What do you want me to do?

697
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:13,525
I want you to say no more about it,
like he said not to.

698
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:18,466
Bobbie,
Mr. Summers represents Food World.

699
00:54:18,873 --> 00:54:22,832
God is with "World World."
It's a slightly bigger obligation.

700
00:54:23,411 --> 00:54:26,869
- Bigger than your job?
- I have no choice.

701
00:54:27,248 --> 00:54:28,806
That's the problem.

702
00:54:28,883 --> 00:54:30,783
The problem is, you do!

703
00:54:31,419 --> 00:54:34,786
How far do you intend to take this?
How long is this going to go on?

704
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:39,850
Until everyone gets the message.
Until I can convince people of this miracle.

705
00:54:40,428 --> 00:54:41,861
I mean, that's what it is.

706
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:43,795
It's a miracle, nothing less.

707
00:54:43,865 --> 00:54:47,460
I have to reach the greatest number
of people possible and tell them.

708
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:50,766
It's for you.
The producer of <i>The Dinah Shore Show</i>.

709
00:54:51,439 --> 00:54:55,671
You've been on television a long...
Not that long. I'm sorry.

710
00:54:55,744 --> 00:54:58,144
No, I'm much younger than I look.

711
00:54:58,813 --> 00:55:01,646
- No, I didn't want to say it that way.
- You look...

712
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:05,311
I'm younger than people think I am,
because I've been around a long time.

713
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:07,855
Everything you've done
has had such tremendous impact.

714
00:55:07,922 --> 00:55:10,982
<i>It's been magnificent.
I've never done anything bad in my life.</i>

715
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:12,458
<i>I'm one of the perfect people.</i>

716
00:55:12,527 --> 00:55:14,495
<i>- That's kind of exciting.
- It is.</i>

717
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:16,792
<i>Do you remember your first moment
on television?</i>

718
00:55:16,865 --> 00:55:21,825
<i>Actually, I do, It was in 1948.
It was Maggie McNellis's Crystal Room.</i>

719
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:24,064
<i>We were told to be visual in those days.</i>

720
00:55:24,139 --> 00:55:26,539
The Picture of Dorian Grey
<i>was very popular then.</i>

721
00:55:26,608 --> 00:55:29,941
<i>I gave a 15-second impression</i>
<i>of</i> The Picture of Dorian Grey,

722
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:32,206
<i>About the man who carouses.</i>

723
00:55:32,447 --> 00:55:34,915
<i>He stays looking good,
but his picture falls apart.</i>

724
00:55:48,863 --> 00:55:51,093
- Ready, Mr. Landers?
- Right.

725
00:55:52,467 --> 00:55:54,401
<i>I think I broke a jaw.</i>

726
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:00,334
America is not ready for this.

727
00:56:02,544 --> 00:56:05,604
Okay, you'll take the empty seat
next to Dinah.

728
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:10,111
- This show is taped, isn't it?
- Yes, it'll be on a week from today.

729
00:56:10,552 --> 00:56:14,886
You may have read about my next guest
in the newspapers recently.

730
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:19,320
He is a supermarket manager
from Tarzana, California...

731
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:23,621
who says that he has been instructed
by God to spread the message...

732
00:56:23,698 --> 00:56:26,724
that God lives and God cares.

733
00:56:27,368 --> 00:56:29,734
Please welcome Mr. Jerry Landers.

734
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:36,276
- Am I on?
- Almost, that applause is for you.

735
00:56:38,847 --> 00:56:41,577
- Is Dinah nice, Daddy?
- Not now, honey.

736
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,650
<i>- You're not nervous, are you?
- No.</i>

737
00:56:46,588 --> 00:56:50,820
<i>I don't mind telling you, I am.
You have some pretty powerful friend.</i>

738
00:56:53,128 --> 00:56:55,528
- Why are they laughing?
- Just watch.

739
00:56:56,064 --> 00:56:58,123
Because God is Daddy's friend.

740
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:03,964
<i>- Why do you suppose he picked you, Jerry?
- God only knows, I mean...</i>

741
00:57:06,141 --> 00:57:07,403
<i>You're right.</i>

742
00:57:07,475 --> 00:57:12,139
<i>You said that God wants us to know
that he still cares.</i>

743
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:15,347
<i>Is there anything else
that he wants us to know?</i>

744
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:19,113
<i>Yes, that he's given us everything
that we need to make our life work...</i>

745
00:57:19,187 --> 00:57:21,519
<i>make the world work,
and that he's watching us.</i>

746
00:57:21,589 --> 00:57:23,580
<i>- He's watching?
- Yes.</i>

747
00:57:23,658 --> 00:57:25,091
<i>Watching us?</i>

748
00:57:25,994 --> 00:57:27,393
<i>- Now?
- Yes.</i>

749
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:36,895
<i>You agreed earlier
to be part of an experiment today...</i>

750
00:57:37,438 --> 00:57:39,838
<i>with the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

751
00:57:39,908 --> 00:57:41,967
<i>Do you want me to take a lie detector test?</i>

752
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:43,772
<i>- No.
- I will.</i>

753
00:57:44,646 --> 00:57:48,980
<i>What this is, is a sketch artist
from the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

754
00:57:49,284 --> 00:57:53,812
<i>He's an expert and very adept
at making a sketch from a description.</i>

755
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:57,915
<i>I think all of us here would like to know
what God looks like.</i>

756
00:57:57,992 --> 00:57:59,550
<i>You would like to know.</i>

757
00:58:03,831 --> 00:58:05,093
<i>- Shall we?
- Okay.</i>

758
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:06,599
<i>Follow me.</i>

759
00:58:07,535 --> 00:58:11,164
<i>- Jerry, this is Mr, Fernando Ponce.
- Hello, sir.</i>

760
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:13,002
<i>- Please sit there.
- Thank you.</i>

761
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:18,311
<i>Mr, Ponce, as I said, is an expert
at eyewitness sketches...</i>

762
00:58:18,513 --> 00:58:20,504
<i>for the LA Police Department.</i>

763
00:58:22,951 --> 00:58:25,749
<i>- How do I start?
- Tell me about the shape of his face.</i>

764
00:58:26,187 --> 00:58:27,882
<i>The shape is...</i>

765
00:58:29,557 --> 00:58:31,081
<i>triangular.</i>

766
00:58:31,526 --> 00:58:32,652
<i>- Good.
- I guess.</i>

767
00:58:33,995 --> 00:58:37,556
<i>- He's got large ears.
- He has?</i>

768
00:58:37,632 --> 00:58:40,430
Jerry, I don't believe you actually did this.

769
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:41,991
It was their idea.

770
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:44,230
<i>He does, He wears glasses.</i>

771
00:58:45,373 --> 00:58:47,034
<i>God wears glasses?</i>

772
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:51,569
<i>He's wearing a fishing cap.</i>

773
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,249
<i>- A fishing cap?
- Maybe it's like a baseball cap.</i>

774
00:58:55,383 --> 00:58:58,477
<i>His lips are kind of thin.
His nose is straight.</i>

775
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:01,953
<i>It's round on the ends.</i>

776
00:59:02,023 --> 00:59:04,082
No one's supposed to know
what God looks like.

777
00:59:04,158 --> 00:59:05,716
- I do.
- You do?

778
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,687
Yeah. In <i>Bible Comics,</i>
they had a picture of him last week.

779
00:59:10,265 --> 00:59:14,759
<i>They're horn-rimmed glasses.
They're plastic ones, you know?</i>

780
00:59:14,836 --> 00:59:17,999
<i>Where would you suppose
he would get his glasses?</i>

781
00:59:20,074 --> 00:59:21,598
<i>I don't know.</i>

782
00:59:23,378 --> 00:59:25,437
<i>- Anywhere he likes.
- Yeah.</i>

783
00:59:27,515 --> 00:59:30,882
Boy, I sure hope my friends are
doing their homework.

784
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:34,683
<i>This is what God looked like to you?</i>

785
00:59:35,723 --> 00:59:38,283
<i>He's sort of captured the sense...</i>

786
00:59:39,327 --> 00:59:40,521
<i>I guess.</i>

787
00:59:41,362 --> 00:59:43,956
<i>America, here it is...</i>

788
00:59:44,399 --> 00:59:48,165
<i>as seen through the eyes of Jerry Landers.</i>

789
00:59:48,236 --> 00:59:49,294
<i>God.</i>

790
01:00:01,616 --> 01:00:04,107
Dad, you're going to get God arrested.

791
01:00:06,654 --> 01:00:10,852
- You said it would be done by 6:00.
- I'm sorry, but I just got the part.

792
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:17,021
- Weren't you on the <i>Dinah Show</i> last night?
- Yeah.

793
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:20,563
Yeah, that was real different.

794
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:23,230
Excuse me.

795
01:00:23,404 --> 01:00:25,634
How am I supposed to get home now?

796
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,134
Where to, mister?

797
01:00:32,513 --> 01:00:33,741
Get in.

798
01:00:46,294 --> 01:00:48,387
I hope you have a license.

799
01:00:56,137 --> 01:00:59,834
- Did you watch <i>Dinah Shore</i> last night?
- I watch everything.

800
01:01:00,775 --> 01:01:03,938
I got you national exposure.
I hope you're happy.

801
01:01:04,712 --> 01:01:06,441
I could be happier.

802
01:01:07,382 --> 01:01:08,474
How?

803
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:10,312
For starters, you do a show like that...

804
01:01:10,385 --> 01:01:12,910
you don't let them put you on
the last few minutes.

805
01:01:12,987 --> 01:01:15,012
That's for fellas who write diet books.

806
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:16,818
It wasn't up to me.

807
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,490
And what was that drawing thing?

808
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,427
- He was a police artist.
- Man draws crooks.

809
01:01:23,131 --> 01:01:27,727
Makes everybody look like a crook.
Made me look like a second-story man.

810
01:01:28,403 --> 01:01:32,066
- It's publicity.
- I'm used to a little better treatment.

811
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:37,143
That painting of me by Michelangelo,
that's a picture.

812
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:40,103
And he did it laying flat on his back.

813
01:01:41,082 --> 01:01:42,310
Now what happens?

814
01:01:42,383 --> 01:01:46,979
Now we see who can still believe,
who wants to, who needs to.

815
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:50,147
A few million people
saw you last night, right?

816
01:01:50,224 --> 01:01:52,624
A few million?
Some of them will believe you.

817
01:01:52,693 --> 01:01:55,389
Some are going to want to
punch me in the head.

818
01:01:55,463 --> 01:01:57,397
Some will want to fire me.

819
01:01:57,465 --> 01:01:59,797
Some may decide I'm too crazy to live with.

820
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:02,961
We can't worry about those.
The ball is rolling.

821
01:02:03,171 --> 01:02:07,301
- Yeah, right over me.
- Don't be a malcontent, I'll watch over you.

822
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:10,469
While you're watching over me,
would you mind watching the road?

823
01:02:10,545 --> 01:02:12,274
I'd rather watch a nice sunset.

824
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,724
<i>Dinah Shore</i> must get a pretty big rating.

825
01:02:35,403 --> 01:02:37,030
You're on, kid.

826
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:50,813
- Jerry?
- Yes, God?

827
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:54,010
You have the strength
that comes from knowing.

828
01:03:21,148 --> 01:03:24,606
Can I have one minute with you?
I have something very important to say.

829
01:03:24,685 --> 01:03:25,947
It just can't wait.

830
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:28,488
Please, bless my baby.

831
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:32,684
Touch him, pray for him. Pray for my baby.

832
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,558
If I could just have one second with you...

833
01:03:36,664 --> 01:03:39,155
- It's not for me, it's for you.
- Sanctify my body.

834
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:41,394
Bless him, make him a true believer!

835
01:03:41,469 --> 01:03:44,165
I have something very important.
This is for you!

836
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:46,729
- Give me your golden staff.
- I can't!

837
01:03:47,408 --> 01:03:51,367
- God said it's okay.
- I'll tell you this, it's very important!

838
01:03:51,512 --> 01:03:54,072
Officer, could you move
the rest of them along?

839
01:03:54,148 --> 01:03:55,410
Yes, sir.

840
01:03:56,551 --> 01:03:59,179
One little moment, please.
What I have to tell him is...

841
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:00,253
Okay.

842
01:04:00,621 --> 01:04:03,613
I went to empty the garbage,
and two people blessed me.

843
01:04:03,691 --> 01:04:05,886
Then one of them blessed the garbage.

844
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,521
And then he asked me if our children
were conceived immaculately.

845
01:04:09,597 --> 01:04:10,928
Now, calm down, honey.

846
01:04:10,998 --> 01:04:13,159
The police had to take our kids
to school today.

847
01:04:13,234 --> 01:04:15,794
- They said it was safer.
- That's awful!

848
01:04:16,003 --> 01:04:18,494
Yes, that's awful.
You want to hear awfuller?

849
01:04:18,573 --> 01:04:21,064
Mr. Summers said that Lowell Wilson...

850
01:04:21,142 --> 01:04:25,203
is personally deciding
whether or not you can keep your job.

851
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:27,274
Is that awful enough for you?

852
01:04:27,348 --> 01:04:29,441
Now, Bobbie, don't let it get to you.

853
01:04:29,517 --> 01:04:31,144
Don't let it get to me?

854
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:35,449
Jerry, it's gotten to me! Don't you see?

855
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:39,284
Jerry, look, you've got him to talk to.

856
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,660
It's just me here,
me and those religious nuts outside!

857
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:46,456
I have to leave the phone off the hook.

858
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:49,799
People keep calling up
and asking to talk to God.

859
01:04:50,104 --> 01:04:54,165
Except, of course, for the guy
who offered to chew on my pantyhose!

860
01:04:55,977 --> 01:04:59,743
Telegrams, notes in the mail box
and the doorways.

861
01:05:00,348 --> 01:05:02,816
Today they even put one in the dog's mouth.

862
01:05:02,883 --> 01:05:04,282
This is from the university.

863
01:05:04,352 --> 01:05:06,946
I've been invited to appear
before a theology group.

864
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:09,819
<i>- They want to verify the miracle.
- Terrific.</i>

865
01:05:09,924 --> 01:05:14,122
<i>It is! This'll give me credibility,
and God'll get his word across.</i>

866
01:05:14,195 --> 01:05:15,753
<i>It'll help me keep my job.</i>

867
01:05:16,998 --> 01:05:20,229
Mr. Landers,
it is the consensus of this group...

868
01:05:21,002 --> 01:05:25,996
that you are a person of
little or no theological knowledge.

869
01:05:26,874 --> 01:05:29,434
You have demonstrated, over the years...

870
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:33,810
an astonishing lack of interest
in spiritual matters.

871
01:05:35,049 --> 01:05:39,679
It strikes me,
as one who has actually heard his voice...

872
01:05:40,554 --> 01:05:45,548
that you have virtually no prerequisites
to make direct contact...

873
01:05:45,626 --> 01:05:48,686
- with the Almighty, whatsoever.
- You've heard him?

874
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:53,096
He has made his word known to me.

875
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:54,498
What was he wearing?

876
01:05:55,269 --> 01:05:57,601
I know his word through the scriptures.

877
01:05:57,672 --> 01:05:59,936
It would be blasphemy to suggest...

878
01:06:00,007 --> 01:06:02,908
that we could describe the Creator
in human terms.

879
01:06:02,977 --> 01:06:04,103
Why?

880
01:06:04,178 --> 01:06:05,702
If He created us...

881
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:10,581
why wouldn't he appear to us as one of us?

882
01:06:10,651 --> 01:06:11,651
Don't you...

883
01:06:19,326 --> 01:06:21,260
Don't you, young man...

884
01:06:21,862 --> 01:06:25,457
try to teach this assemblage
the role of the Deity.

885
01:06:27,835 --> 01:06:31,134
Rabbi Silverstone,
my good and great friend...

886
01:06:31,205 --> 01:06:35,574
brother in the work of the Lord, with
whom we have broke bread many times...

887
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:38,407
is a pillar of the American Jew community.

888
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:43,677
Bishop Reardon represents millions
of Roman Catholics.

889
01:06:44,485 --> 01:06:48,080
Bishop Marcos,
multitudes of Greek Orthodoxers.

890
01:06:48,856 --> 01:06:52,087
Why, we have virtually every
religious persuasion...

891
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:53,717
represented here today.

892
01:06:53,794 --> 01:06:56,695
And I personally have been chosen...

893
01:06:56,764 --> 01:06:59,892
to render the benediction
at this year's Super Bowl.

894
01:07:02,536 --> 01:07:07,496
Mr. Landers, we really find
insufficient documentation...

895
01:07:08,142 --> 01:07:09,803
to support your claim.

896
01:07:09,877 --> 01:07:11,845
But you're not saying it didn't happen.

897
01:07:11,912 --> 01:07:15,575
No, we are saying
there is insufficient documentation.

898
01:07:15,649 --> 01:07:20,143
Which puts the score at God 7, you 0.

899
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:24,524
We have decided, however,
out of a sense of fairness...

900
01:07:24,592 --> 01:07:27,152
and ecclesiastical curiosity...

901
01:07:27,495 --> 01:07:31,363
to allow you to present us
with certain evidence.

902
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:33,396
What evidence?

903
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:36,231
We have assembled a set of questions...

904
01:07:37,371 --> 01:07:39,805
for you to ask God.

905
01:07:40,775 --> 01:07:42,675
There are 50 questions.

906
01:07:44,211 --> 01:07:45,508
Fifty.

907
01:07:46,614 --> 01:07:49,139
You want me to get God to take a quiz?

908
01:07:49,216 --> 01:07:51,650
Unless you've been concealing
an abundant knowledge...

909
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:53,846
Which I find highly doubtful.

910
01:07:53,921 --> 01:07:57,721
There are questions there
that you could not possibly answer.

911
01:07:59,527 --> 01:08:02,428
Look, I don't know when...

912
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:04,821
or if he'll ever appear again.

913
01:08:04,899 --> 01:08:09,427
As a control measure, you will remain
locked in your hotel room...

914
01:08:09,804 --> 01:08:11,271
alone.

915
01:08:12,873 --> 01:08:14,773
- Not even my wife?
- No.

916
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:17,367
There'll be no outside calls, whatsoever.

917
01:08:19,246 --> 01:08:21,180
You could, of course, decline.

918
01:08:21,248 --> 01:08:24,445
But then,
that would form the basis of our report.

919
01:08:34,428 --> 01:08:35,588
God?

920
01:08:53,214 --> 01:08:55,182
- God?
- Room service.

921
01:09:02,823 --> 01:09:05,018
Just put it right around over here, please.

922
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:10,052
You can't come in. I understand.

923
01:09:10,931 --> 01:09:12,831
Do I need to sign this?

924
01:09:15,736 --> 01:09:17,567
Thank you very much.

925
01:09:31,685 --> 01:09:34,449
- They forgot the ketchup.
- Come in!

926
01:09:35,256 --> 01:09:37,281
They're playing our number.

927
01:09:47,034 --> 01:09:50,299
$11 for a steak? Who would have thought?

928
01:09:50,504 --> 01:09:54,565
With me, cows were an afterthought.
Just to give new mothers a little rest.

929
01:09:56,644 --> 01:09:59,772
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
- Eat. It'll get cold.

930
01:10:05,486 --> 01:10:06,612
Pretty cute.

931
01:10:07,187 --> 01:10:10,179
- What is it?
- They made sure you couldn't answer.

932
01:10:10,257 --> 01:10:12,851
The questions are in the ancient tongue
of Aramaic.

933
01:10:12,927 --> 01:10:14,656
Is that what that is?

934
01:10:15,162 --> 01:10:19,724
They've figured out so many ways to talk
to each other, they're finding nobody can.

935
01:10:20,334 --> 01:10:24,236
Let's see.
"What's the true origin of the universe?

936
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:30,433
"What is the source of the planet Earth?"
It's a History final, right?

937
01:10:35,215 --> 01:10:36,807
So many repeats.

938
01:10:37,851 --> 01:10:39,648
Eat the steak, and then get a pen.

939
01:10:44,024 --> 01:10:47,016
"Did man fall from grace
in the Garden of Eden?"

940
01:10:48,362 --> 01:10:52,298
I'll tell you something, never came out.
I made Adam 17.

941
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:54,990
Eve was 15, 16, tops.

942
01:10:55,369 --> 01:10:58,463
I figured then,
16, 17 was middle-age, you know.

943
01:10:58,539 --> 01:11:03,067
Who knew people would live so long?
Trees, I figured they had the best chance.

944
01:11:03,143 --> 01:11:05,976
Now I realize that they were kids, babies.

945
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,380
Young people can't fall from my grace.
They're my best things. Put that down.

946
01:11:14,555 --> 01:11:16,682
- "Which of the world's..."
- Wait.

947
01:11:18,192 --> 01:11:19,192
Okay.

948
01:11:19,259 --> 01:11:23,320
"Which of the world's religions is
the closest to the divine truth?"

949
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:27,895
The divine truth is not in a building
or a book or a story.

950
01:11:29,003 --> 01:11:32,962
Put down that the heart is the temple
wherein all truth resides.

951
01:11:36,276 --> 01:11:38,710
"Is Jesus Christ the son of God?"

952
01:11:45,686 --> 01:11:46,983
Jesus was my son.

953
01:11:49,023 --> 01:11:50,547
Buddha was my son.

954
01:11:51,091 --> 01:11:53,719
Mohammed, Moses, you...

955
01:11:53,861 --> 01:11:57,262
the man who said there was
no room in the inn was my son.

956
01:11:57,331 --> 01:12:00,528
So is the one who charges $11 for steak
in this one.

957
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:02,034
Let's mush on.

958
01:12:02,536 --> 01:12:04,663
What was that last question?

959
01:12:07,307 --> 01:12:10,674
- "Will there..."
- "Will there be a judgment day for man?"

960
01:12:12,446 --> 01:12:15,847
If they mean a doomsday,
an end-of-the-world thing...

961
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:18,077
I'm certainly not going to get into that.

962
01:12:18,152 --> 01:12:21,883
But if you want my personal opinion,
I wouldn't look forward to it.

963
01:12:21,955 --> 01:12:25,413
There'd be a lot of yelling,
and I don't need that anymore than you do.

964
01:12:25,492 --> 01:12:26,720
Got that?

965
01:12:27,561 --> 01:12:28,721
Got it.

966
01:12:29,363 --> 01:12:32,332
"What is the meaning of man's existence?"

967
01:12:34,935 --> 01:12:36,835
Life is like a glass of tea.

968
01:12:38,005 --> 01:12:42,942
No, I better not go for laughs.
Voltaire may have had me pegged, right?

969
01:12:43,577 --> 01:12:47,741
He said I was a comedian playing
to an audience who's afraid to laugh.

970
01:12:47,915 --> 01:12:51,442
But seriously,
put down that man and women-persons...

971
01:12:52,219 --> 01:12:55,518
their existence means
exactly and precisely...

972
01:12:55,589 --> 01:12:59,047
not more, not one tiny bit less,
just what they think it means.

973
01:12:59,126 --> 01:13:01,560
What I think doesn't count at all.

974
01:13:02,396 --> 01:13:05,388
- That's very profound.
- Sometimes I get lucky.

975
01:13:08,235 --> 01:13:10,465
- Last question.
- Thank God.

976
01:13:10,537 --> 01:13:11,936
You're welcome.

977
01:13:13,207 --> 01:13:16,074
"Why have you chosen
to appear at this time?"

978
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,010
You've already said.

979
01:13:18,078 --> 01:13:20,239
Maybe they want to hear it
in your own words.

980
01:13:21,882 --> 01:13:25,841
I want to say to everyone that everything
around them that they see and smell...

981
01:13:25,919 --> 01:13:28,717
and feel and hear,
they should delight in all this.

982
01:13:28,789 --> 01:13:31,781
That what is here are
some of my very best ideas.

983
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:33,554
I want everyone to try very hard...

984
01:13:33,627 --> 01:13:36,118
to make sure
it doesn't all go down the drain.

985
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:39,325
Give me, I'll do it.

986
01:13:42,436 --> 01:13:45,894
Can you remember exactly what you said?
It was perfect.

987
01:13:48,575 --> 01:13:51,601
Boy, these answers are
really going to get them.

988
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,972
That's my handwriting!

989
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:57,149
Imagine that.

990
01:13:58,552 --> 01:14:00,679
Shall I call the panel
and tell them I'm ready?

991
01:14:00,754 --> 01:14:04,053
Never mind the panel.
You deliver those papers to Rev. Williams...

992
01:14:04,124 --> 01:14:07,321
- the one who looks like a football player.
- I didn't like him.

993
01:14:07,394 --> 01:14:10,488
He's having one of his big dos
at the Shrine Auditorium.

994
01:14:10,564 --> 01:14:14,125
Every time I turn around,
he's spreading the word, my word.

995
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:18,103
Only, my words he ran out of years ago.
I'll tell you the truth.

996
01:14:19,106 --> 01:14:21,040
The reason I put everybody here naked...

997
01:14:21,108 --> 01:14:25,306
I wasn't trying to be cute,
I just didn't want to create clothes.

998
01:14:25,379 --> 01:14:29,645
With clothes, there's right away pockets,
and you have to put something in them.

999
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:31,980
You take these,
and give them to Rev. Bigmouth.

1000
01:14:32,052 --> 01:14:34,577
Tell him that God says he's a phony.

1001
01:14:34,855 --> 01:14:38,621
Also, tell him if he wants to get rich, fine.
Tell him to sell Earth Shoes.

1002
01:14:38,692 --> 01:14:42,560
But personally tell him
I'd like him to shut up. I'll see you.

1003
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:47,859
God?

1004
01:14:49,536 --> 01:14:50,662
Yeah?

1005
01:14:51,438 --> 01:14:54,305
- Thank you.
- Hope I get an "A."

1006
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,307
<i>Love.</i>

1007
01:15:01,281 --> 01:15:03,306
<i>Let's talk about love.</i>

1008
01:15:04,518 --> 01:15:05,678
<i>What is it?</i>

1009
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:08,849
<i>You can love your brother, can't you?</i>

1010
01:15:09,223 --> 01:15:12,192
<i>You can love your wife or your husband.</i>

1011
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,953
<i>You can love your new dress.</i>

1012
01:15:16,496 --> 01:15:18,464
<i>You can love my new car.</i>

1013
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:22,664
<i>You can pass by a pet shop...</i>

1014
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:26,630
<i>and say, "I just love
that little doggie in the window,"</i>

1015
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:30,705
<i>You can love this, and you can love that.</i>

1016
01:15:31,445 --> 01:15:33,640
<i>But what am I talking about?</i>

1017
01:15:34,748 --> 01:15:36,579
<i>Some folks say...</i>

1018
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:40,313
<i>that love is what they saw
in a pornographic movie.</i>

1019
01:15:41,421 --> 01:15:44,254
<i>But that is lust, not love.</i>

1020
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,261
<i>- Is that what you want?</i>
- No!

1021
01:15:49,763 --> 01:15:52,061
<i>- Is that love?</i>
- No!

1022
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:55,101
<i>- Is that what the Bible teaches?</i>
- No!

1023
01:15:55,168 --> 01:15:57,728
<i>- Is that what I'm talking about?</i>
- No!

1024
01:15:57,838 --> 01:16:01,535
<i>No, because what I'm talking about
is the kind of love...</i>

1025
01:16:01,608 --> 01:16:04,168
<i>that calls for a sacrifice.</i>

1026
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:08,440
<i>Are you willing to make a sacrifice...</i>

1027
01:16:08,515 --> 01:16:11,245
<i>to show God how much you love him?</i>

1028
01:16:11,318 --> 01:16:12,444
Yes!

1029
01:16:12,519 --> 01:16:16,888
<i>To show God how you love him
with all of your heart and soul?</i>

1030
01:16:17,424 --> 01:16:18,424
Yes!

1031
01:16:18,992 --> 01:16:21,756
<i>- How do we love God? With all our...</i>
- Hearts!

1032
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:24,695
<i>- How do we love God? With all our...</i>
- Souls!

1033
01:16:24,765 --> 01:16:27,529
<i>- Is that what I'm talking about?</i>
- Yes!

1034
01:16:28,702 --> 01:16:30,693
<i>Yes, amen, I say, yes!</i>

1035
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:33,899
<i>- Raise your right hand, and say amen!</i>
- Amen!

1036
01:16:33,974 --> 01:16:35,532
<i>- Say amen!</i>
- Amen!

1037
01:16:43,617 --> 01:16:46,780
<i>And you can show God how you love him...</i>

1038
01:16:48,388 --> 01:16:50,413
<i>by digging down deep...</i>

1039
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:57,119
<i>so that this ministry will reach
all of the people of the earth!</i>

1040
01:16:57,564 --> 01:16:59,725
<i>Because the Bible tells us:</i>

1041
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,668
<i>"Show God you love him,
and he will show you the way,"</i>

1042
01:17:04,137 --> 01:17:05,399
Amen!

1043
01:17:06,006 --> 01:17:08,804
<i>Now, I'm going to ask all of you
to come up.</i>

1044
01:17:09,176 --> 01:17:11,167
<i>Those of you who haven't come up before...</i>

1045
01:17:11,244 --> 01:17:14,179
<i>I'm going to ask you to come up for God.</i>

1046
01:17:14,981 --> 01:17:19,611
<i>Shake my hand, and let God see us together.</i>

1047
01:17:20,787 --> 01:17:23,483
<i>Because the Bible tells us...</i>

1048
01:17:23,557 --> 01:17:26,958
<i>that God knows the falling of a sparrow...</i>

1049
01:17:27,594 --> 01:17:32,588
<i>and the depth of a pocket,
and that is what I'm talking about!</i>

1050
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,993
Amen!

1051
01:17:35,168 --> 01:17:38,399
<i>Come up, brothers and sisters...</i>

1052
01:17:38,672 --> 01:17:43,405
<i>and put in our hands
what you would put in God's hands...</i>

1053
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:48,274
<i>and he will have the whole world
in his hands!</i>

1054
01:17:50,016 --> 01:17:54,578
"He's got the whole world in his hands

1055
01:17:54,654 --> 01:17:58,715
"He's got the whole world in his hands

1056
01:17:58,792 --> 01:18:02,751
"He's got the whole world in his hands

1057
01:18:02,829 --> 01:18:04,626
"He's got the whole world..."

1058
01:18:04,698 --> 01:18:07,360
May the Lord bless and keep you.
It's so good to see you.

1059
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:08,492
You can put that right...

1060
01:18:08,568 --> 01:18:11,036
Yes, thank you very much. God bless you.

1061
01:18:12,706 --> 01:18:16,142
May the Lord always bless you
and keep you. It's so good to see you.

1062
01:18:16,209 --> 01:18:17,836
Thank you, please keep moving.

1063
01:18:18,912 --> 01:18:20,903
- Rev. Williams.
- That's all right.

1064
01:18:20,981 --> 01:18:23,006
He is in need of me.
What are you doing here?

1065
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:25,847
- God sent me to you.
- One moment!

1066
01:18:27,954 --> 01:18:31,583
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
brothers and sisters...</i>

1067
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:36,425
<i>this is the young man
who has used so much energy...</i>

1068
01:18:36,496 --> 01:18:40,489
<i>to convince everyone that he has seen God.</i>

1069
01:18:42,302 --> 01:18:43,360
<i>Now, wait!</i>

1070
01:18:45,539 --> 01:18:47,837
<i>Would you repeat what you just said to me?</i>

1071
01:18:49,509 --> 01:18:50,771
<i>God sent me to you.</i>

1072
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:54,747
<i>God sent him to me!</i>

1073
01:18:56,016 --> 01:18:59,110
<i>- Are you certain of that?
- Yes, I just left him.</i>

1074
01:19:00,387 --> 01:19:04,380
<i>He wanted me to give you these answers
to all of those questions.</i>

1075
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:06,551
<i>- God specified me?
- Yes.</i>

1076
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:10,023
<i>And he also asked me to tell you
that he's very unhappy.</i>

1077
01:19:10,096 --> 01:19:12,826
<i>God is very unhappy.</i>

1078
01:19:12,899 --> 01:19:17,393
<i>Yes, he's unhappy that you're
getting rich this way.</i>

1079
01:19:17,471 --> 01:19:21,464
<i>And that he'd like you to stop pretending
that you're spreading his word.</i>

1080
01:19:21,741 --> 01:19:24,209
<i>In fact, he suggested that you sell shoes.</i>

1081
01:19:25,512 --> 01:19:27,742
That's what he said! You're a fake!

1082
01:19:28,748 --> 01:19:30,773
<i>This poor boy is ill.</i>

1083
01:19:30,917 --> 01:19:32,179
Get him out of here!

1084
01:19:35,222 --> 01:19:36,883
Rev. Williams!

1085
01:19:38,925 --> 01:19:42,986
Slander, Your Honor.
Slander, surely, cruel and foul.

1086
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:47,531
The Rev. Willie Williams is
on the road for God...

1087
01:19:47,601 --> 01:19:50,126
to the tune of 100,000 miles a year.

1088
01:19:50,637 --> 01:19:53,731
He's a tireless, selfless
servant of the Lord.

1089
01:19:54,674 --> 01:19:59,668
The idea that he'd line his pockets
in this pursuit is the unkindest cut of all.

1090
01:20:00,947 --> 01:20:03,882
Not only is Willie Williams'
organization nonprofit...

1091
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:08,649
he personally pays over six figures
in income tax every year.

1092
01:20:09,022 --> 01:20:11,547
Give him back his honor, Your Honor.

1093
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:16,819
Award him the damages we seek
from this defendant.

1094
01:20:18,465 --> 01:20:20,558
A man so out of touch with reality...

1095
01:20:20,634 --> 01:20:24,502
he even tries to smear the good name
of a religious giant.

1096
01:20:24,905 --> 01:20:28,773
A man whom the President of
the United States once called...

1097
01:20:28,842 --> 01:20:31,072
"God's own quarterback."

1098
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,043
Thank you, Your Honor.

1099
01:20:38,485 --> 01:20:41,579
Mr. Landers, will you come
to the bench, please?

1100
01:20:46,993 --> 01:20:49,621
- You haven't changed your mind?
- No, sir.

1101
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:54,594
A professional lawyer would be helpful.
This is a tough time for you to be alone.

1102
01:20:56,169 --> 01:20:58,637
I won't be alone, sir.

1103
01:21:05,345 --> 01:21:08,610
- They're just going to kill you today, Jerry.
- We'll see.

1104
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:12,107
We're going to lose everything
you worked for.

1105
01:21:14,054 --> 01:21:16,420
Isn't there any way
you can say you're sorry?

1106
01:21:16,489 --> 01:21:18,252
That it was all a big mistake?

1107
01:21:18,825 --> 01:21:22,124
No, because I'm not, and it wasn't.

1108
01:21:22,963 --> 01:21:25,625
I just can't believe
that God would set me up...

1109
01:21:25,699 --> 01:21:28,099
<i>to get me into all of this trouble.</i>

1110
01:21:28,168 --> 01:21:30,898
<i>I have to believe that he had a reason...</i>

1111
01:21:30,971 --> 01:21:34,907
<i>and I have to believe
that he'll bail me out.</i>

1112
01:21:35,275 --> 01:21:39,575
<i>And all I want to say is,
that young man is out of his mind.</i>

1113
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,213
And the absolute being, the all-powerful,
all-knowing, all-merciful...

1114
01:21:45,285 --> 01:21:48,448
infinite spirit, the supreme soul...

1115
01:21:48,521 --> 01:21:50,955
the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords...

1116
01:21:51,591 --> 01:21:54,719
the infinite, everlasting eternal being...

1117
01:21:55,295 --> 01:21:58,389
last came to you how?

1118
01:22:00,433 --> 01:22:01,798
As a busboy.

1119
01:22:08,475 --> 01:22:10,739
Your Honor, I rest my case.

1120
01:22:15,649 --> 01:22:17,913
You may step down now, Mr. Landers.

1121
01:22:26,259 --> 01:22:29,057
Call your witnesses, please, Mr. Landers.

1122
01:22:29,262 --> 01:22:33,198
Yes, Your Honor, I would like to call
one witness and one witness only.

1123
01:22:42,142 --> 01:22:43,871
I'm waiting, Mr. Landers.

1124
01:22:45,278 --> 01:22:46,336
Yes.

1125
01:22:48,682 --> 01:22:53,119
Your Honor, I would like to call
to the stand the Lord God.

1126
01:22:57,257 --> 01:23:01,159
I object. The defendant's trying
to make a mockery of this proceeding.

1127
01:23:01,394 --> 01:23:03,487
Your Honor, I was trying to make a point.

1128
01:23:03,563 --> 01:23:05,463
- What point?
- Your Honor...

1129
01:23:08,768 --> 01:23:11,794
when I just asked God to take the stand...

1130
01:23:12,472 --> 01:23:17,239
in that brief moment after I called him,
wasn't there a trace of expectation?

1131
01:23:17,444 --> 01:23:19,309
Just a trace, Your Honor?

1132
01:23:20,747 --> 01:23:24,444
Wasn't there a hesitation in this room?
Didn't you feel it?

1133
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,051
Didn't we all feel it?

1134
01:23:30,623 --> 01:23:33,820
It was the possibility that God does exist.

1135
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:38,326
And if he exists, he could materialize
and sit right in that chair.

1136
01:23:39,299 --> 01:23:42,757
In that moment, Your Honor,
when no one in this room knew...

1137
01:23:42,836 --> 01:23:46,363
what was going to happen next,
in that flash of an instant...

1138
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:51,200
lies the benefit of the doubt you must
give me to know that my story is true.

1139
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:54,178
And that I spoke exactly as God asked me.

1140
01:23:55,515 --> 01:24:00,475
Mr. Landers, I cautioned you earlier
that legal representation would be helpful.

1141
01:24:01,221 --> 01:24:04,452
I must now warn you that,
in addition to the plaintiff's charges...

1142
01:24:04,524 --> 01:24:07,084
I'm seriously considering
citing you with contempt.

1143
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,160
Amen.

1144
01:24:08,228 --> 01:24:11,095
For what you apparently thought
was a very clever stunt.

1145
01:24:11,164 --> 01:24:15,225
You're getting deeper and deeper
into trouble with this court, Mr. Landers.

1146
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:16,825
Excuse me, Your Honor.

1147
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:21,165
It's him.

1148
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:24,441
Bobbie, it's him.

1149
01:24:27,514 --> 01:24:30,039
- This is most irregular.
- Your Honor, he...

1150
01:24:30,116 --> 01:24:31,708
I'll take it from here.

1151
01:24:33,052 --> 01:24:35,179
May I ask who you are, sir?

1152
01:24:35,255 --> 01:24:38,349
You better swear me in.
You'll never believe it.

1153
01:24:47,066 --> 01:24:50,627
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

1154
01:24:50,703 --> 01:24:52,227
So help me me.

1155
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:54,597
So help you you?

1156
01:24:55,975 --> 01:24:59,604
If it pleases the court,
and even if it doesn't please the court...

1157
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,613
I'm God, Your Honor.

1158
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,747
Order in the court.

1159
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:14,854
Your Honor, I'd like permission
to question this witness.

1160
01:25:15,228 --> 01:25:18,322
Sit down, Sonny,
I've answered enough questions.

1161
01:25:22,969 --> 01:25:27,201
He saw me, just like he said.
Each word true.

1162
01:25:28,374 --> 01:25:31,810
The man tried to tell a lie,
his tongue would snap off.

1163
01:25:32,345 --> 01:25:35,439
Which I wouldn't say
I could say about everybody.

1164
01:25:35,515 --> 01:25:37,540
Why is it so hard for you to believe?

1165
01:25:37,617 --> 01:25:41,053
Is my physical existence
any more improbable than your own?

1166
01:25:42,288 --> 01:25:45,655
What about all that hoo-hah with the devil
a while ago, from that movie?

1167
01:25:45,725 --> 01:25:48,319
Nobody had trouble believing
that the devil took over...

1168
01:25:48,394 --> 01:25:50,692
and existed in the little girl.

1169
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:52,693
All she had to do was wet the rug...

1170
01:25:52,765 --> 01:25:55,893
throw up some pea soup,
and everybody believed.

1171
01:25:57,103 --> 01:25:59,833
The devil you could believe, but not God?

1172
01:26:01,207 --> 01:26:04,870
I work in my own way.
I don't get inside little children.

1173
01:26:05,445 --> 01:26:08,312
They got enough to do,
just being themselves.

1174
01:26:09,148 --> 01:26:12,117
I'm not going to go around
to every person in the world and say:

1175
01:26:12,185 --> 01:26:14,619
"Look, it's me, I want to talk to you."

1176
01:26:14,888 --> 01:26:16,549
So I picked one man.

1177
01:26:18,157 --> 01:26:19,818
One very good man.

1178
01:26:21,828 --> 01:26:24,626
I told him God lives. I live.

1179
01:26:26,199 --> 01:26:30,761
He had trouble believing, too,
in the beginning. I understood.

1180
01:26:33,006 --> 01:26:36,100
I'm not sure how
this whole miracle business started.

1181
01:26:36,175 --> 01:26:40,077
The idea that anything connected with me
has to be a miracle.

1182
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,714
Personally, I'm sorry that it did.

1183
01:26:42,782 --> 01:26:45,751
It makes the distance between us
even greater.

1184
01:26:47,687 --> 01:26:51,748
But if a miracle helps you believe
that I am who I say I am...

1185
01:26:54,961 --> 01:26:57,054
I'll give you one, a good one.

1186
01:26:57,864 --> 01:27:01,732
Let me see.
What's my most impressive miracle?

1187
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:08,835
Pick a card.

1188
01:27:09,008 --> 01:27:12,500
- What?
- Pick a card, any card.

1189
01:27:15,949 --> 01:27:20,886
- I don't know what you think you're doing.
- A cute little miracle. Go ahead, pick one.

1190
01:27:21,087 --> 01:27:23,783
- There are no cards there.
- Look again.

1191
01:27:30,463 --> 01:27:32,931
There's nothing miraculous
about good sleight of hand.

1192
01:27:32,999 --> 01:27:35,126
Have you ever seen this one?

1193
01:27:43,543 --> 01:27:47,946
Yes, I've seen them make cards appear
and disappear.

1194
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:54,084
As a matter of fact, I once saw
a magician make an elephant disappear.

1195
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:57,617
Good. Now I'll show you one
that you haven't seen.

1196
01:28:01,094 --> 01:28:03,221
Have to get these shoes fixed.

1197
01:28:05,832 --> 01:28:08,198
Watch this, Your Honor.

1198
01:28:27,453 --> 01:28:30,718
<i>I know how hard it is, in these times,
to have faith.</i>

1199
01:28:31,290 --> 01:28:34,657
<i>But maybe if you could have the faith
to start with...</i>

1200
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:39,831
<i>maybe the times would change.
You could change them, Think about it.</i>

1201
01:28:40,767 --> 01:28:43,736
<i>Try, And try not to hurt each other.</i>

1202
01:28:44,537 --> 01:28:46,664
<i>There's been enough of that.</i>

1203
01:28:47,106 --> 01:28:49,131
<i>It really gets in the way.</i>

1204
01:28:49,709 --> 01:28:53,440
<i>I'm a God of very few words,
and Jerry's already given you mine.</i>

1205
01:28:54,747 --> 01:28:58,740
<i>However hopeless, helpless,
mixed-up and scary it all gets...</i>

1206
01:28:59,719 --> 01:29:01,209
<i>it can work.</i>

1207
01:29:01,988 --> 01:29:04,422
<i>If you find it hard to believe in me...</i>

1208
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:08,151
<i>maybe it would help you to know
that I believe in you.</i>

1209
01:29:08,828 --> 01:29:10,853
<i>Your Honor, I rest my case.</i>

1210
01:29:23,843 --> 01:29:25,037
What?

1211
01:29:31,851 --> 01:29:34,251
This court is now recessed.

1212
01:29:36,322 --> 01:29:39,485
May I see both parties
in my chambers, please?

1213
01:29:40,026 --> 01:29:43,860
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?</i>

1214
01:29:44,564 --> 01:29:46,156
<i>So help you you?</i>

1215
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:49,862
Where's...

1216
01:29:53,539 --> 01:29:55,200
<i>Order in the court.</i>

1217
01:29:56,976 --> 01:30:01,310
<i>Your Honor, I'd like permission
to question this witness.</i>

1218
01:30:11,424 --> 01:30:13,221
That's all there is.

1219
01:30:13,559 --> 01:30:18,428
Not one word of what I assume
we all assume we heard.

1220
01:30:18,498 --> 01:30:20,056
Someone must have erased it.

1221
01:30:22,635 --> 01:30:25,126
Nobody erases tapes anymore.

1222
01:30:26,539 --> 01:30:30,100
- Then the machine...
- No. Not a thing wrong with it.

1223
01:30:31,444 --> 01:30:33,776
He said he couldn't be recorded.

1224
01:30:33,846 --> 01:30:38,283
God, when he first spoke to me,
he said it wasn't his real voice I heard.

1225
01:30:38,351 --> 01:30:41,115
He said he was just using one
that I could understand.

1226
01:30:41,187 --> 01:30:42,916
He did it again today.

1227
01:30:42,989 --> 01:30:45,787
And there's nothing wrong
with your stenotype machine?

1228
01:30:45,858 --> 01:30:48,850
It took down every word, Your Honor,
except now...

1229
01:30:48,928 --> 01:30:51,192
some of them are not on the paper.

1230
01:30:51,531 --> 01:30:54,864
Don't you see?
He wants us all to decide for ourselves...

1231
01:30:54,934 --> 01:30:56,993
whether or not we saw him and heard him.

1232
01:30:57,069 --> 01:31:00,197
It's what he always said,
that everything is up to us.

1233
01:31:00,273 --> 01:31:05,006
No! There is no proof whatsoever
that God was in that courtroom today.

1234
01:31:05,444 --> 01:31:07,742
No, none whatsoever.

1235
01:31:07,813 --> 01:31:11,408
- We saw Him! We heard Him!
- We did.

1236
01:31:14,053 --> 01:31:17,955
- He made himself and the cards disappear.
- We saw it.

1237
01:31:19,058 --> 01:31:23,324
On the basis of our common experience
here today...

1238
01:31:23,996 --> 01:31:27,591
I can see why you first claimed,
and later maintained...

1239
01:31:27,667 --> 01:31:32,161
that you had seen,
and been in the actual presence of...

1240
01:31:33,406 --> 01:31:34,406
God.

1241
01:31:34,874 --> 01:31:39,834
And for that reason,
your remarks to the Rev. Williams...

1242
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:42,380
could be regarded as a divine assignment.

1243
01:31:43,349 --> 01:31:47,911
I shall rule, therefore,
that the charge of slander be dismissed.

1244
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:49,921
Sam!

1245
01:31:51,023 --> 01:31:54,186
Now, if, as you also claim...

1246
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:57,957
it is God's opinion...

1247
01:31:58,197 --> 01:32:02,224
that we should all make
our own decisions...

1248
01:32:02,301 --> 01:32:04,895
and abide by them accordingly...

1249
01:32:04,971 --> 01:32:08,839
then I must also rule
that on the basis of the evidence...

1250
01:32:12,878 --> 01:32:16,041
or rather the lack of it...

1251
01:32:16,415 --> 01:32:19,578
that as much as we all may think...

1252
01:32:19,652 --> 01:32:22,348
that what we saw here today was real...

1253
01:32:23,456 --> 01:32:27,415
God did not, in fact,
appear here before us.

1254
01:32:30,896 --> 01:32:34,730
You may, of course,
appeal to a higher court.

1255
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,761
We heard from the highest court.

1256
01:32:41,907 --> 01:32:43,238
Thank you.

1257
01:32:44,076 --> 01:32:47,876
- Good-bye, Mister Slavic.
- And Jer, we'll send you your picture.

1258
01:32:49,482 --> 01:32:51,109
- Would you do that?
- Sure.

1259
01:32:51,183 --> 01:32:52,183
Thank you.

1260
01:34:37,723 --> 01:34:38,917
Hello?

1261
01:34:39,792 --> 01:34:41,953
- Where are you?
- Turn around.

1262
01:34:50,503 --> 01:34:52,266
How do you like it?

1263
01:34:52,338 --> 01:34:56,035
I'm going on a trip
to spend a little time with animals.

1264
01:34:56,342 --> 01:35:00,335
I like animals, and sometimes
I don't spend enough time with them.

1265
01:35:01,147 --> 01:35:04,981
- We failed, didn't we?
- What are you talking? We did terrific.

1266
01:35:05,317 --> 01:35:09,754
I gave a message of encouragement,
you passed it along, now we'll see.

1267
01:35:10,256 --> 01:35:13,851
You did good. We both did good.
We're covered.

1268
01:35:14,126 --> 01:35:15,957
You think anybody got the message?

1269
01:35:16,028 --> 01:35:19,122
Do you think we have enough apples
in the world?

1270
01:35:19,498 --> 01:35:20,498
Apples?

1271
01:35:20,599 --> 01:35:23,932
We got all the apples we need.
You're Johnny Appleseed.

1272
01:35:24,003 --> 01:35:28,804
You drop a few seeds, and you move on.
If the seeds are good, they'll take root.

1273
01:35:29,208 --> 01:35:31,768
I gave you great seeds, the best.

1274
01:35:32,077 --> 01:35:33,601
I lost my job, you know.

1275
01:35:34,346 --> 01:35:37,406
There are other cities, other supermarkets.

1276
01:35:37,483 --> 01:35:39,212
Everybody thinks I'm a nut.

1277
01:35:39,585 --> 01:35:44,045
Galileo, Pasteur, Einstein, Columbus.

1278
01:35:44,423 --> 01:35:47,017
You're in good company. Hold on.

1279
01:35:50,095 --> 01:35:51,687
Better be going.

1280
01:35:52,097 --> 01:35:54,463
- Aren't you coming back?
- No.

1281
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:58,228
- Ever?
- When ever comes, we'll see.

1282
01:35:58,637 --> 01:36:02,266
Sometimes, now and then...

1283
01:36:03,442 --> 01:36:04,909
couldn't we just talk?

1284
01:36:04,977 --> 01:36:08,208
I'll tell you what. You talk, I'll listen.
