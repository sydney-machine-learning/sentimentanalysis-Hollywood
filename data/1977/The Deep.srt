another look down there?

176
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:08,578
Yes. Well, as I said,
it might, but not to me.

177
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,913
Thank you. Sorry you can't stay for lunch.

178
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,166
DAVID: Wait a minute, Mr.
Treece. That's all?

179
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,418
Come on, David. Let's go.
Just a sec. Just a sec.

180
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,004
Boy, you might not mind
wasting any more of your time,

181
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,006
but I can't have you
wasting anymore of mine.

182
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,924
Listen, you said there was
something special.

183
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,635
Let's go take a look. Good afternoon.

184
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,795
You Okay?

185
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,304
[HORN HONKING]

186
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,349
DAVID: Gail.

187
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:12,517
[HONKING]

188
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:13,935
Go right.

189
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,232
[HONKING]

190
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,485
I wonder what the hell this guy's doing.

191
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,823
David!

192
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,826
[HONKING]

193
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,953
Try and pull over.

194
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,746
I can't!

195
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,583
[HONKING]

196
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,135
David!

197
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,568
David? Yeah?

198
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,583
HENRI: Should have sold me that bottle.

199
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,879
Now you force me to take what
you would not let me pay for.

200
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:11,093
Well, if it'll ease your mind,
I'll still name a price.

201
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,725
Take off their blindfolds.

202
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,099
Look, if it's not in the bag,
I don't know where in the hell it is.

203
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,481
The girl. Look, she hasn't got it--

204
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,484
If his tongue moves again, cut it.

205
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,862
I'll do it.

206
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,023
Put it back on.

207
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,954
Since neither of you
seem to have that bottle,

208
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:28,791
I must assume it is now
the property of Romer Treece.

209
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,919
Well, then, for Christ's sake, let him go.

210
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:39,468
It hasn't been all that pleasant
for you, has it, Mr. Sanders?

211
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,305
Enjoy yourselves this evening.

212
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,891
Eat a good dinner,

213
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,352
go dancing.

214
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:52,815
But be off the island by tomorrow.

215
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,661
Treece.

216
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,290
Come on, Treece.

217
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,502
All right, Treece. What the hell's going on?

218
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,171
Take it up.

219
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,089
Listen, I'll look after this.

220
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,552
<i>Okay -</i>

221
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,683
COFFIN: Hold it. TREECE: Coffin?

222
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:36,108
He's the only man alive who might
know one of these ampoules on sight.

223
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,943
Can I show him your map, please?

224
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,155
He was the sole survivor
of the Goliath, you see.

225
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,244
Thank you.

226
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,540
Now, then, Adam,

227
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,960
this one of your legendary ampoules?

228
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,056
This is the real thing, all right.

229
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,479
The old girl's finally lost her virginity.

230
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,816
My friends found it there.

231
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:24,490
Well, the way she's lying here a
storm must've flipped her around.

232
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:28,160
She was never this close
to the edge of the reef before.

233
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,414
You're lucky.

234
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,125
Five people have died over the last 30 years

235
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,920
trying to crawl inside that ship.

236
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,673
Blew themselves up poking torches around.

237
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,260
There's enough live ammo down
there to blow up half the island.

238
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,930
Oh, come on, will somebody just cut the crap?
Blew themselves up for what?

239
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,723
<i>Goliath</i> was a military ship, boy.

240
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,768
Went down with munitions
and medical supplies.

241
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,311
Or so they say.

242
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,771
They're there, all right.

243
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,398
All right, what's there?

244
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:06,198
Morphine, 98,000 ampoules.

245
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,409
I packed them myself.

246
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,828
Jesus. Why didn't you tell us the truth?

247
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:14,206
If you had of told us, we wouldn't have
had that run-in with that Haitian.

248
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,542
The name's Cloche.

249
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,128
The fact you didn't know nothing
is probably what saved you.

250
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,964
I wasn't sure myself until now.

251
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:24,758
The first time he's told me the truth.

252
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:29,096
Adam, what do you reckon
to the rest of them, then?

253
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:35,269
They're probably all smashed
up by the ordnance now.

254
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,606
The way she's lying here,

255
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,610
this time there won't be any steel
plate to have to burn through.

256
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,614
They've performed a bloody autopsy on
that wreck with everything but forceps,

257
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,949
but nobody ever found one of those before.

258
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,492
Well, we found one.

259
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,163
Oh, we are having a wonderful
day, aren't we, David?

260
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,165
How come nobody found one until now?

261
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:59,209
Well, the sea's a joker, boy.
Loves to fool you.

262
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,963
Dive a wreck one day, you find nothing.
That night, blows up a storm,

263
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,634
go back again, same spot,
you find a carpet of golden coin.

264
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,012
We just had one of the worst storms
in 10 years, haven't we, Adam?

265
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,181
MAN: Coffin!

266
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,350
Goddamn it. Coffin.

267
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,603
"Coffin. Goddamn it, Coffin."

268
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,689
Nice to meet you folks.

269
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,700
Mr. Treece?

270
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,703
Which one of us turns this thing
over to the government?

271
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,291
Well, now, miss,

272
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,460
I'm going to have to think on that.

273
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:45,339
You see, I was never one
much to bother with formalities.

274
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:47,716
Morphine's not exactly a formality.

275
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,803
That's halfway to heroin. Halfway to hell.

276
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,098
I know all about that. So does Cloche.

277
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,226
By the time some Hamilton bureaucrat
gets off of his fat bum,

278
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:59,436
it will be heroin.

279
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:03,983
That's why I'm gonna
dive down there tonight.

280
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,695
You haven't answered
my question, Mr. Treece.

281
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,660
I'll answer the question, babe. I'm
turning this over to the government.

282
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:17,705
I'm all the government you need, boy.

283
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,877
Put that right back.

284
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,559
Now, the reasons are two.
They're mine and yours.

285
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:41,729
Mine, if there are thousands
of ampoules down there

286
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,106
and Cloche gets his hands on them,

287
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:47,192
that junk will be on the street
in New York in a week.

288
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,612
Yours, if you're lucky,
it's the only one left,

289
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:54,616
but if you go to the government,
your treasure hunt will be off

290
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,952
and if there is any treasure down there,

291
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,831
you'll just be reading about
somebody else finding it.

292
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,298
David, please don't dive.

293
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,426
Make up your own mind, boy.

294
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,637
I have made up my mind, Treece.

295
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,806
I'm diving with you tonight,

296
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,142
or otherwise I'm handing over
all this information

297
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,770
to the authorities this afternoon.

298
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:37,159
Look, Gail, it's important to me.
You understand?

299
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,411
Listen, David, it's morphine. Morphine.

300
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,954
We only met the man today.

301
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,916
Don't know anything more about him
than you want to.

302
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,502
I can't afford to pass it up.
It's an experience.

303
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,670
Experience? Don't you mean privilege?

304
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,465
He suckered you in like a 5-year-old.
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

305
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:53,550
I blackmailed him. You remember that?

306
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:57,513
Is that the way you remember it?
Yes, because that's the way it was.

307
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,850
There's treasure down there, Gail. I know.
I got a feeling. So I gotta go look.

308
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,686
You're so blind right now, you couldn't
even see it if it was in front of you.

309
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:08,315
Well, look, I feel things, so I do them.
That's just the way I am.

310
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,484
And you wind up with T-shirts.

311
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:15,781
Oh, Jesus. That's unfair.
That's totally unfair.

312
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,575
Look, I didn't come here for you.

313
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,119
I came here for us.

314
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,037
So would you please think about it?

315
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,459
I always think about us.

316
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,359
Say, who is that guy?
I don't like him at all.

317
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:55,863
Well, you're going to have to learn to like
him because that's Kevin, he's family.

318
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:59,408
My mother liked him.
Told him to look after me.

319
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,493
TREECE: Put your gear in the cabin.

320
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,245
COFFIN: Well, here I am.

321
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,207
I'm all ready. I've got all my gear.

322
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:11,670
Well, I'm sorry you had such a long walk,
Adam, because you're not diving tonight.

323
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,381
The hell I'm not.

324
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,926
That's my ship out there.
Those are my mates.

325
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,053
Your ship's dead.

326
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,763
So are your mates.

327
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,933
So were you too when I found you
washed up on the beach.

328
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,604
And there's never bringing any
of us back again, is there?

329
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,522
You just go on home now.

330
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,357
Good night.

331
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,319
All set, captain? Aye.

332
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:52,878
Full moon tonight. We're gonna
stick out like a cherry on a cream pie.

333
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,964
Cast her off forward, Kev.

334
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,528
Would you like some of that rum?

335
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,155
Yeah.

336
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,412
There you go. No, thanks.

337
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,332
I never drink before I dive.

338
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,421
You know what they say about these waters?

339
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,966
If the Jamaican pirates don't get you,

340
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:42,594
it'll be the cold embrace of the sea.

341
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,181
And that's no lover's kiss.

342
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,353
You know every ship from the New World

343
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,523
passed through these waters? They had to.

344
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:58,277

just a few days.

How much is Treece paying you, by the way?

01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,956
I'll pay 10 percent.

How many did they bring up today?

Six. Four thousand or so.

And yet Treece claims
they're all down there?

That's what the girl says, yes.

711
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:05,239
It almost seems as if Treece is
hiding something from both of us.

Doesn't it, my friend?

You know, maybe you were right.

Come here. Have a look at this.

that were lost in the storm.

722

But according to this list,

723
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:52,286
more was lost than the fleet's
sailing manifest said was sent.

724
01:28:53,746 --> 01:28:56,999
You know the difference?
The difference is jewels.

725
01:28:57,416 --> 01:29:01,587
Not trinkets, mind you.
Masterpieces, works of art.

726
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:05,424
Two pages of the list were lost.
They never got to Seville.

That's where the original is.

733
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:26,779
Yeah, but does it say anything
about what we found?

01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:29,281
Like the pine cone filled with pearls

This doesn't even look like
a proper manifest to me.

739
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:41,877
It's not a manifest. It's a shopping list.

For a woman. For what?

741
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:47,049

Oh, come on, Gail.
We've got an E.F., not a D.P.

745
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:01,980
GAIL: The Duchess of Parma was her title.

746
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:04,233
Elizabeth Farnese was her real name.

747
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,320
Come on, girl. Get on with it.
Well, it seems that in 1714

748
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:11,115
when King Philip's first wife had just died,

749
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:14,201
he developed a royal lust

750
01:30:14,368 --> 01:30:16,245
for the beautiful Duchess of Parma.

751
01:30:16,412 --> 01:30:19,289
Well, she finally agreed
to marry him, by proxy,

752
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:22,876
but he wasn't there yet because
Elizabeth wasn't the kind of woman

753
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:25,921
to give away something
for nothing, like her virginity.

754
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:27,881
And before he could touch that,

755
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:33,011
she insisted that he deck her up
with a set of jewels, quote,

756
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,305
"unique in all the world," unquote.

757
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:38,225
Now, Philip commissioned
those jewels to be made

758
01:30:38,392 --> 01:30:41,353
and if that's what we found,
he never got laid.

Oh, beautiful. Just beautiful.

01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:47,151
Yeah, she was a pretty smart lady.

You know, I've known him for three years

is a sweater and a pair of sneakers.

770
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:14,386
and you knew it had something so personal,

771
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:16,847
so valuable, belonging to the king of Spain.

772
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:22,519
You might not put it on a
prime target like a flagship.

773
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:25,063
You might just put it
on a French tobacco ship.

774
01:31:25,856 --> 01:31:28,192
I mean, you know the fleet
would be there for protection,

775
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:31,528
but then the whole fleet sinks
except the French tobacco ship

776
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:34,072
and the governor keeps to his story

777
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:37,743
and he lists the box as lost
along with the fleet.

in another hurricane off Bermuda

There is a dragon pendant. "A

That's it. That's it.

Then the jeweller that made this
pendant also made this medallion.

858
01:46:49,904 --> 01:46:52,156
Now, if I go down there and I find the chain

Treece, we solved it. It was here all along.

864
01:48:17,241 --> 01:48:20,244
It's the provenance. David's
seen part of it down there.

865
01:48:20,411 --> 01:48:23,623
You solved nothing.
What the hell you talking about?

866
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:26,417
I'm going to blow the <i>Goliath</i> now.

867
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:28,669
Why now?

868
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:33,174
Because if anything happens to me,

869

there's nobody else left to do it.

You go ahead and blow the Goliath,
Treece. You go ahead and blow it.

872
01:48:55,863 --> 01:48:58,824
But first, I'm going down there.
I'm getting that provenance.

873
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:04,247
Go upstairs, pack, and go home.

To hell with it, Treece. I'm not doing that.

As you please, boy.

878
01:49:17,677 --> 01:49:19,428
Excuse me.

879
01:49:26,018 --> 01:49:28,354
You don't need me down there, do you?

David, I'm gonna signal you
when I fire this fuse.

01:51:05,618 --> 01:51:09,413
After that, I don't care if you've found
the Holy Grail itself.

885
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:12,750
You've only got three minutes, so get out.

886

Listen. Now, don't worry.

01:51:21,926 --> 01:51:24,595
Just turn on the air dredge
when I get in, all right?

I'll be all right, huh?
