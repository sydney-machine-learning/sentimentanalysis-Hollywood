1
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,059
<i>Guy?</i>

2
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,520
<i>Guy. You've got to go!</i>

3
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,688
- Guy, it's okay.
- No!

4
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:08,651
Son, the tar is rising. You've got to go.

5
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,236
No, not without you!

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,031
<i>Don't look at us. Look behind you.</i>

7
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:17,452
Do you see the light?
You need to follow that light, okay?

8
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,579
Don't stop. Don't hide.

9
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,373
Follow the light,

10
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,959
<i>and you'll find Tomorrow.</i>

11
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,852
"Follow the light."

12
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,944
<i>Travel log: Guy here.</i>

13
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,530
<i>It's been 14 moons
since the mission began.</i>

14
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,533
<i>Following the light,
but no sign of Tomorrow yet.</i>

15
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,035
<i>Travel log: it's been 29 moons.</i>

16
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,912
<i>Still no sign of Tomorrow.</i>

17
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,456
<i>I did find this little fellow.</i>

18
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,291
<i>He's all alone, just like me.</i>

19
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,876
<i>He's a good lookout.</i>

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,713
<i>I'm thinking of calling him "Watch."</i>

21
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,048
<i>Travel log: it's been 54 moons.</i>

22
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,092
<i>Seventy-three moons.
A hundred and ten moons.</i>

23
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,969
<i>Two hundred moons.</i>

24
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,555
Travel log: it's been...

25
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,682
a lot of moons.

26
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,766
All the moons.

27
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,268
Still no sign of Tomorrow.

28
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,272
Something's coming. Belt, disguise mode.

29
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,280
It's a person!

30
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,386
<i>Oops. Yeah, that was me.</i>

31
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,055
<i>Hi. I'm Eep.</i>

32
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,516
<i>In my defense,
I had been living in a cave my whole life,</i>

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,852
<i>and I didn't really come across
other people very often,</i>

34
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,271
<i>let alone... a boy!</i>

35
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:12,359
<i>And to think, the only two teenagers
in the world, and we found each other.</i>

36
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,235
<i>It's like fate brought us together.</i>

37
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,321
<i>My whole family loved him...</i>

38
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,864
Whoo-hoo!

39
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,115
<i>...except for Dad.</i>

40
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,410
<i>But eventually, Guy won him over.</i>

41
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,621
- Fire.
- Fire.

42
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,373
<i>And now we're traveling the world,</i>

43
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,833
<i>searching for a perfect place
to call home,</i>

44
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,044
<i>a place Guy calls Tomorrow.</i>

45
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,421
Ooh! Tomorrow.

46
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,881
<i>Isn't Guy amazing?</i>

47
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,218
<i>He gives me a funny feeling,
like I have butterflies in my stomach.</i>

48
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,638
<i>Not just the ones I had
for lunch, but other butterflies.</i>

49
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,683
<i>I don't know what this feeling's called,
but it looks like this.</i>

50
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,185
<i>And this, and this, and this!</i>

51
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:51,272
<i>I love drawing this shape!
I don't know why. It just feels right.</i>

52
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:55,068
Eep likes Guy. Eep likes Guy.

53
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,736
Gross. Right, Douglas?

54
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,657
Mom! Thunk is looking at my diary again!

55
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,242
Thunk, leave your sister alone!

56
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,910
Come on, Eep. Share the tablet.

57
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,079
- I'm not done yet! Give it back!
- No!

58
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,664
Kids, stop fighting.

59
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,541
Get him, Eep! Go for the groin.

60
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,127
I will turn this death cat around!

61
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,964
<i>There have been
plenty of obstacles along the way,</i>

62
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,091
<i>but it's nothing us Croods can't handle.</i>

63
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,845
We've got some angry kangadillos
on our tail.

64
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,264
Aah!

65
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,858
Belt, seat belt mode.

66
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,364
I told you,
don't take the canyon!

67
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,242
- Okay!
- You never take the canyon!

68
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,829
Whoa!

69
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:56,796
Ooh.

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,798
Drop her!

71
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,429
Oh!

72
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,513
Sandy!

73
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,520
- Oops.
- Hey!

74
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,897
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,523
Hey! Get your head in the game!

76
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,405
That's my girl.

77
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,990
Boom!

78
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,034
- Boomsies?
- Boomsies.

79
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,704
<i>Dad always says,
"The pack stays together."</i>

80
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,039
The pack stays together!

81
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,416
<i>But with Guy,</i>

82
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,960
<i>sometimes it feels like
it's just the two of us.</i>

83
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,254
<i>♪ I think I love you ♪</i>

84
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:40,882

So... hungry.

98
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,575
Ahh!

99
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,118
I still would've eaten that.

100
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,703
All right, pack.

101
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,331
Nothing has tried to kill us in the last
ten minutes, so let's camp here.

102
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,001
Gran and Thunk,
you find us a place to sleep.

103
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,627
- Here.
- Here's good.

104
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,838
Sandy and Chunky,
you stand watch.

105
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,591
Ugga and I will forage.

106
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,093
Guy and Eep? Guy and Eep?

107
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,845
Guy and Eep?

108
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,263
- Boop.
- Boop!

109
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,431
- Boop.
- Boop.

110
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,515
- Boop.
- Boop.

111
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,933
Hello! Hey!

112
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,602
You're in charge of the fire.

113
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,355
- No problem, Dad.
- You can count on us, Dad.

114
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,606
Don't call me that!

115
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,233
Hey.

116
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,735
"Hey" what?

117
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,070
Hey, you.

118
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,571
"Hey, you" back.

119
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,199
Uh-uh. I "Hey, you'd" first.

120
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,117
And I'm "heyying" you right back.

121
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,622
Look at them!

122
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,041
Guy used to have so many ideas.

123
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,835
I mean, wasn't he the one
that gave us fire?

124
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,382
Now he's useless!
Th-They'd never survive on their own!

125
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,133
Hungry.

126
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:51,513
I know, Thunk, and we'll eat our ration
of dry twigs and bitter roots

127
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,058
just as soon as two pack members,
who shall remain nameless,

128
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,894
do their jobs and start the fire!

129
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,314
Come on, man. Just chill.

130
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,068
No, you "come on, man!"
I'm gonna chill your a...

131
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,152
Hey, hey, hey, Grug.

132
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,447
Easy. Calm down, big guy.

133
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,285
You know, Grug, eventually,

134
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,957
Eep and Guy, they're gonna wanna
start their own pack, just like we did.

135
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,041
It's our nature.

136
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,419
No way. Not happening!

137
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,921
The pack is stronger together.

138
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,466
Yes! You did it!

139
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,011
Eep would never leave us. No.

140
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,471
Like Eep would ever... Come on.

141
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,692
No. No!

142
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,944
Pack stays together.

143
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,572
Pack stays together. Pack stays together.

144
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,121
Oh!

145
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,749
Eep. Eep, are you awake?

146
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:01,833
Yeah.

147
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,668
Hold on. I'm coming over.

148
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,754
Aah!

149
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,131
Oh. Hey, Gran.

150
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,271
- Hi.
- Hi.

151
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,440
Can he hear us?

152
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,692
- Nah. Once he's out, he's out.
- Oh.

153
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,362
- Hey.
- Hey.

154
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,907
No, no. This is a "hey" with a question.
Um...

155
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,576
So, uh, I was thinking...

156
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,912
That's not my hand.

157
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,583
Anyway, uh...

158
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,461
I couldn't sleep.
I was thinking about Tomorrow.

159
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,171
Our Tomorrow.

160
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,715
Our Tomorrow?
What do you mean?

161
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,342
What I mean is, um,

162
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:58,014
maybe our Tomorrow is different
than the rest of... of the pack's.

163
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,976
Maybe our Tomorrow is a place
of our own, you know?

164
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,063
Like a home. Just the two of us.

165
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,648
Just the two of us?

166
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,527
Hmm. Guy, I'd really miss my family.

167
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,531
But that does sound amazing!

168
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,032
A place of our own?

169
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,951
Our home?

170
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,120
Ooh! Can our home have flowers?

171
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,746
Sure can. And butterflies.

172
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,331
And a sweet, babbling brook?

173
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,999
And privacy.

174
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,793
Ooh! What's "privacy"?

175
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,213
It means you only smell the feet
you wanna smell.

176
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,297
Wow.

177
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,216
So, um...

178
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,804
do you, Eep Amber Crood,

179
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,099
think you could
spend your Tomorrow with me?

180
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,812
I do.

181
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:52,569
I'm going to fall asleep
and dream about our home.

182
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,487
- Good night, Guy.
- Good night, Eep.

183
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,534
Just the two of them?

184
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,874
Warping my baby's mind
with whispers and kisses.

185
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:09,878
"Can Grug hear us?"
Oh, yeah, Grug hears. Grug hears all.

186
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,505
All about your private
two-person house of Tomorrow,

187
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,592
whispering, kissing,
butter-babble-brooking.

188
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,178
What the heck is that?

189
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,103
Thunk,

190
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,730
make it stop.

191
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:30,940
Hit snooze!

192
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,108
Stop it, tummy.

193
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,654
Another glorious morning.

194
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,823
What's that? You wanna play?

195
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,075
Go get it, boy!

196
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,284
No, Sandy!

197
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,412
Mom! Sandy's fetching
Douglas's stick again.

198
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,042
Uh, what's that?

199
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,544
Kill circle!

200
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,551
Safety off, babe.

201
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,636
Thanks.

202
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,643
Today is a good day to die!

203
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,938
Hey, everyone!
You'll never guess what I fo...

204
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,483
Oops. Sorry, honey.

205
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,694
We thought you were a predator
trying to kill us.

206
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,987
No, never apologize
for an effective kill circle.

207
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,865
You have to come see this.
Follow me! Come on. This way.

208
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:21,991
Whoo-hoo!

209
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,952
Yes! You're gonna love it!

210
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,877
- Wow!
- Whoa.

211
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,888
Dun-dun-duh?

212
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,643
What is that?

213
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,062
I've never seen anything like it.

214
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,608
What is it, Mom? Make it leave.

215
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,902
There's something about this.

216
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,866
I think it's... the end of the world.

217
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,118
Looks like I've seen it all.

218
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,080
Well, that's it for me.
I'm glad it's you, Chunky.

219
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,458
It's not the end.

220
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,295
It's just the beginning.

221
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,548
Welcome to our Tomorrow!

222
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,054
- Whoa.
- Wow!

223
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,138
Wow!

224
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,435
Look at all this food!

225
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,103
Guy, are you seeing this?

226
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,314
You're the best dad ever! Let's eat!

227
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,399
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
One moment, Thunk.

228
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,569
Before we eat,
I'd like to say a few words.

229
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:44,491
Let this flag mark the day
I discovered our home,

230
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,994
filled with flowers, and butterflies,

231
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,662
and a sweet, babbling brook.

232
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,039
Huh?

233
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,750
Here, right here,
all your needs will be met...

234
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,044
- I'm hungry!
- In a minute!

235
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,295
Go now! He's not looking.

236
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,297
- Whoa!
- Whoa. Ahh.

237
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,008
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just a minute. Just a minute. One minute.

238
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,302
No, no, no. Wait, wait. Just wait.

239
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:08,014
This is our home, a place we'll always
be together forever and ever,

240
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,349
and you're welcome!

241
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,519
I did this.

242
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,853
Problem solved.

243
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,439
Whoo-hoo!

244
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,942
Food!

245
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,612
Isn't it strange how this food
grows in perfectly straight ro...

246
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,697
Ahh!

247
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,575
Whoo-hoo!

248
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,151
I don't feel like eating anymore.

249
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,444
Mom, am I sick?

250
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,988
No, honey. You're full.

251
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,948
Full feels weird.

252
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,744
I can't eat another bite.

253
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,954
Wait.

254
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,375
Yes, I can.

255
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,544
Buh-nah-nuh.

256
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,879
Banana?

257
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:24,674
I tasted one once, long, long ago.

258
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:28,678
It was summer.
The sun was warm on my shoulders.

259
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,889
Flowers were in high bloom.

260
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,766
I was just a cub.

261
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:36,728
Well, I ate that banana in one bite.

262
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:41,358
And ever since, a day hasn't gone by
without me thinking about it.

263
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,361
What was it like, Father?
What was it like?

264
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,446
No words can describe it, Thunk.

265
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,783
No words are good enough.

266
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:53,370
We get it, Dad. Just grab the banana!

267
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,497
Come here, sweet thing.

268
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,018
Do you guys hear that?

269
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,938
What is that?

270
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,193
What's happening? I can't see.

271
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,404
It's getting closer!

272
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,156
Kill circle?

273
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,453
Something got over the wall.

274
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:36,621
Don't get too close.

275
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:40,375
Who knows what kind of weird
beyond-the-wall creatures they are.

276
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,669
Let's just jab at them from afar.

277
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,004
- Jab!
- Ow!

278
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,422
Jab, jab!

279
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,548
Ah!

280
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,842
Wait a moment.

281
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,053
Look past the matted pelts
and gnashing teeth.

282
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,682
The eyes,
there's a kind of humanity in them.

283
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,976
Ba-na-na.

284
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,020
It's trying to communicate.

285
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,480
Hope, these are people!

286
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,318
Cave people.

287
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,988
I thought cave people died off years ago.

288
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:20,457
We happy meet you.

289
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,584
In hearts...

290
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,212
...much joy.

291
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,466
- Thanks.
- Much joy to you too.

292
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,801
Oh. They speak beautifully.

293
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,763
Oh, forgive our condescension, friend.

294
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:35,847
I'm Phil.

295
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,850
And I am Hope. And we are...

296
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:39,976
The Bettermans.

297
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,895
"Better man"?

298
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,813
- Betterman.
- Emphasis on the "better."

299
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,982
Well, we're the Croods.

300
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,734
- And this is...
- Guy?

301
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,944
Wow. Good guess.

302
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,405
Mr. and Mrs. Betterman?

303
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,407
- Guy!
- What-What's going on here?

304
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,451
- Oh, Guy.
- Guy. Guy!

305
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,328
Hope, it's Guy.

306
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,080
Guy, Guy, Guy.

307
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,706
What's going on here?

308
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,668
I grew up with Hope and Phil.

309
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,337
They were
my parents' best friends until...

310
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,463
Oh, Guy.

311
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,132
We thought we lost your whole family.

312
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:15,512
That was the moment we realized,
in such a dangerous world,

313
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,223
there had to be a better way to live.

314
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,393
Wha...

315
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,811
Is that your home?

316
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,230
Whoa! That's their home!

317
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,357
- Whoa, mama!
- Look, Dad!

318
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,359
Wow.

319
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,111
Hey, Guy, race you to the top.

320
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,657
Oh, um, excuse me, little tiger girl?

321
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,118
- Uh, we don't climb this tree.
- Huh?

322
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,037
- There's a "Betterman" way.
- Unofficial motto.

323
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,581
- Ooh.
- Okay, everybody in?

324
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,166
Ah!

325
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,920
Yeah, the, um, death cat
will have to stay outside.

326
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,131
See ya, Chunky.

327
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,508
Sorry. Animals track in too much...

328
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,136
um, dirt.

329
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,303
Going up.

330
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,305
Whoa! What's happening?

331
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,934
Oh.

332
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,272
Welcome to the Betterman home!

333
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,481
Wow!

334
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,858
It's beautiful!

335
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,818
Kind of big, isn't it?

336
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,070
What?

337
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:19,159
Whoa! I can see the clouds!
But I'm inside.

338
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,369
What is this? What is this?

339
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,164
Uh, we call that a window.

340
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,208
Window.

341
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,211
Okay.

342
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,298
Guy, Dawn will be so happy to see you.

343
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,674
- Dawn?
- Dawn?

344
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,301
Yeah, yeah. We grew up together.

345
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,969
Oh, Dawn!

346
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,220
Ahh!

347
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,515
Oh. That's just your reflection.
It's called a mirror.

348
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,850
Oh, sorry.

349
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:44,976
Dawn!

350
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,063
- Sorry.
- Dawn!

351
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,689
Where is she?

352
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,317
- I'm in the panic cubby!
- Panic cubby!

353
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,028
Dawn, it wasn't wild animals.

354
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,654
It's safe to come out.

355
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,578
Mom, maybe we should drill some air holes
in the door of the panic cubby?

356
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,747
No air holes. Snakes could get in.

357
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,083
But you'll never believe
who we just found.

358
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,835
- Guy?
- Dawn?

359
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,171
Guy! Is it really you?

360
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,589
It's you! You're here!

361
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:18,510
You're so old! So are you!
That's what I said!

362
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:19,594
Oh, together again.

363
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,430
These two were inseparable
when they were young.

364
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,224
Inseparable.

365
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,809
Dawn's a girl?

366
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,814
Hold on, stop.
You accessorize with a sloth?

367
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,650
I accessorize with a sloth!
This is Belt!

368
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,655
- Mine's Sash.
- Ooh la la.

369
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,657
Oh, oh! These are the Croods.

370
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,741
- Hello.
- Hey.

371
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,410
- 'Sup?
- And this...

372
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,911
Wait. Nope, nope.

373
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,371
Yeah. This is Eep.

374
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,248
- You're a girl?
- Yeah.

375
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,499
A girl...

376
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,875
friend!

377
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,128
I've never had a girlfriend before!

378
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,546
- Me either! Me either!
- Girlfriends!

379
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:55,964
Okay, careful! Small bones.

380
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,465
Extra vertebrae!

381
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,050
- This is amazing!
- What do we do?

382
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:01,261
- What do we say to each other?
- What's happening to our voices?

383
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,847
Why are our voices getting so high?

384
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:12,480
As our houseguests,
you're welcome to anything you want.

385
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,358
I know what I want.

386
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,570
Uh, except for that.

387
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,488
But there's so many of them.

388
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,698
Uh, sorry, Grug.

389
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,659
I'm afraid we have one house rule here.

390
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,077
We don't eat the bananas.

391
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,287
But they're right here.

392
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,373
Anything else, anything at all,
is yours to enjoy.

393
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:33,460
But we don't eat the bananas.

394
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,628
- Really?
- Heh?

395
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,922
- No bananas?
- Heh?

396
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,007
But...

397
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,967
We won't eat your bananas.

398
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,969
It's getting late, so...

399
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,472
Well, we can just sleep-pile right here.

400
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,682
Got it. Solid spot, Dad.

401
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,393
Look, Phil. They sleep in a pile.

402
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,395
- Ooh, fun!
- Nuh-uh.

403
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,357
Actually, everyone gets their own rooms.

404
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,901
We get separate rooms!

405
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,028
- What's a room?
- What's a separate?

406
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,073
We Bettermans believe
that privacy promotes individuality.

407
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,532
Unofficial motto.

408
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:08,912
Well, we Croods believe that
the pack sticks together no matter...

409
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:09,996
What?

410
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,790
Tell me about my room,
Mr. Better-dad.

411
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,792
Well, son, it's right this way.

412
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,878
It all started with a tree and an idea.

413
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,551
Wow. What a day.

414
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:26,054
I never thought
I'd see the Bettermans again.

415
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,347
- Hey, you!
- Hey.

416
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,431
Wow.

417
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,934
Sure beats the view
from any cave I know.

418
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,769
Yeah,
I can't believe this place.

419
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:38,358
Oh, this bed is so comfortable.

420
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,194
Ah, nobody's foot in my mouth.

421
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,780
So much better.

422
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,615
Yeah.

423
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:51,871
So, is this that privacy thing
you were telling me about?

424
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,456
Just feels kind of...

425
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,209
far... you know?

426
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:58,837
Guy?

427
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:00,338
Guy?

428
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,258
Guy?

429
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:09,889
Time to watch some late-night window.

430
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,267
Ooh, ooh. Check it out, Douglas.
This guy's my favorite.

431
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:17,022
Okay, moommoth. Whatcha gonna do now?

432
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,234
Oh! What an idiot!

433
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,875
Ugga?

434
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,045
Ugga.

435
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,300
- Ugga!
- Kill circle!

436
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,969
Oh. Hey, honey.

437
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,721
Yeah, I couldn't sleep either.

438
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:53,099
All these separate rooms.
Who could live in a place like this?

439
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,184
Well...

440
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,771
And there's something off about that
Phil Betterman guy. Like, way off.

441
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,856
Grug, you know what I think?

442
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,775
Maybe we could stay.

443
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,444
Excuse me?
You're thinking about staying here?

444
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,198
No. I want to be in the wild
fighting vulture rats for scraps.

445
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,075
- Of course I want to stay.
- Yeah, but...

446
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,451
- It's nice here.
- But...

447
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:14,579
And you were just worried about
your daughter leaving,

448
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,165
but the pack is together.

449
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,249
Sort of.

450
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,795
If you give this place a chance,
you might actually like it here.

451
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,757
Do I have to like Phil?

452
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,176
You have to be nice. No hitting.

453
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,136
Okay.

454
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,138
But if I have to be alone...

455
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,309
I'm gonna be alone with you.

456
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,604
I mean, can you believe it?

457
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:43,775
After all these years,
and Guy shows up on our doorstep.

458
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:47,737
And to think that we were worrying
about Dawn being alone.

459
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,072
And now Guy's back!

460
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,282
It's like fate
brought them back together.

461
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,159
Like it was meant to be.

462
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:58,039
But did you see the way
that cave girl was holding Guy's hand?

463
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:58,957
Hmm.

464
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,752
You don't think Guy could possibly
be serious about that Meep?

465
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:04,462
Or "Peep"? Or is it "Eep"?

466
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:05,797
"Eep." It's "Eep," right?

467
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,926
Well, I'm just not sure
Eep fits in here. You know?

468
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,554
In fact, none of them do.

469
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:16,850
Poor things do seem to struggle
with the concept of walls.

470
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:20,061
I don't know if cave people
belong in a modern world.

471
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,938
Aah!

472
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:24,315
I'm going to watch window forever!

473
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,276
Do they know that?

474
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,070
I feel like we just need to
help them understand

475
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,197
that they have a bright future...

476
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,824
outside these walls.

477
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:38,413
And Guy's future is inside the walls.

478
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,248
With Dawn.

479
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,043
Hope Betterman, always thinking of others.

480
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:45,086
Honestly, I just can't help it.

481
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,388
Ooh, that was...

482
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:58,224
...hands down,
the best night's sleep I've gotten in...

483
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,559
- Morning, Guy!
- Oh!

484
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:00,727
Hi, Mr. Betterman.

485
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,062
Fresh bitter bean juice?

486
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,689
Uh, thank you?

487
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,733
- Hi, Guy!
- Ah! Mrs. Betterman.

488
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,194
These are for you.
I made them last night.

489
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,074
Oh, uh, I should wake Eep up.

490
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:17,035
You know, it's been seven hours
since I said, uh, "Hey."

491
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,953
That's adorable!

492
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:22,540
You know, let's let that poor Eep sleep.
She must be exhausted.

493
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,709
- Nah, I'm sure she's...
- Oh, look!

494
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,504
Here's Dawn! What a coincidence.

495
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:31,132
Why, Dawn, whatever are you doing
on this particular rope bridge

496
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:33,718
at this particular moment in time?

497
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,846
My morning chores?

498
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,556
Morning chores!

499
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:52,779
Genius.

500
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:58,660
Genius!

501
00:26:58,743 --> 00:26:59,869
Genius!

502
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:01,830
Genius!

503
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:04,332
Genius! Genius! Genius!

504
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,378
Genius.

505
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:15,093
Genius. Mmm.

506
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,767
- Boom.
- Boom.

507
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,519
Couldn't sleep last night.

508
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:25,854
Me neither.

509
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:27,981
When I woke up,
your mom was missing.

510
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:30,400
You don't think
a predator took her, do you?

511
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:31,943
Nope. Found her.

512
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,033
It's like this place is changing everyone.

513
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:41,119
We don't sleep-pile anymore.
We don't wake up together.

514
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,955
And Thunk just stares at that box.

515
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,415
Ohh.

516
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:48,168
Not now, Douglas. The birds are on.

517
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:51,713
Dad, relax. It's been one night.

518
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:54,090
And a little change can be... Guy?

519
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:59,054
- Hey.
- Guy?

520
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:03,058
Wow. You're you,
but you don't look like you.

521
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,519
And you smell like flowers.

522
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,146
And soft rain.

523
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,357
More like a clear mountain stream.

524
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,275
With just a hint of vanilla.

525
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,944
It's called a shower.
You should try it.

526
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,906
You want me to smell like vanilla?

527
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:19,157
Just a hint.

528
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,867
What happened to your clothes?

529
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,078
We burned his clothes
while he was in the shower.

530
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:27,290
In fact, they were so dirty
that we washed them and then burned them.

531
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,507
Come on, Thunk. We're going outside.

532
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,842
I don't wanna.
I'm watching birds.

533
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,887
In my day, we didn't stare at birds.
We fought them.

534
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,347
Let me live my life!

535
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,432
Hey, new friend girl!
Want some breakfast?

536
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:45,809
Uh, sure!

537
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,560
Oh! I'll start the fire again.

538
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:48,687
Fire.

539
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:53,650
Hey.

540
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,193
Hey, yeah. Check this out.

541
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:02,409
Now, that's how you make a fire.
You don't need two people anymore.

542
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:05,704
I can't believe how much time
I wasted clacking rocks. This is amazing!

543
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:08,957
And it's such a time-saver,
and it's so simple.

544
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,500
No more smashed fingers.

545
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,043
The Bettermans really do...

546
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:25,849
Oh, there you are.
I was looking all over for you.

547
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:29,227
Whoa. We are really up here!

548
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,980
Do I smell weird to you?

549
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:35,025
You smell... different.

550
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,860
Like river rocks with, uh...

551
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,654
a hint of moss.

552
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,407
Whoa! What's that mark on your wrist?

553
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,284
Oh, it's just a scar.

554
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,368
Scar?

555
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,912
Yeah, from a thorned crab.
No big deal.

556
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,581
Whoa! And that?

557
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,207
Razor worm.

558
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,251
- Well, what about that one?
- Scorpion badger.

559
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:55,879
Swamp snake, sky snake, volcano,

560
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,130
end of the world,

561
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,550
my little sister, my little sister,
my little sister. She bites a lot.

562
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,303
And my dad doesn't even know
about this one.

563
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:06,598
Whoa. Peanut toe.

564
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:10,685
Every mark is an adventure!

565
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,355
My parents won't even let me have scars.

566
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:16,399
That's why they built the wall.
To keep me safe.

567
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,363
You're not allowed outside the wall?

568
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:24,866
Nope, not since
what happened to Guy's family.

569
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,328
So, this farm...

570
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,331
is like your cave.

571
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,916
You're just like me!

572
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,251
Come on.

573
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,881
Oh, man. Is this your ride?

574
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,424
Nah, it's my dad's.

575
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:48,515
Listen to this baby purr.

576
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:51,142
- See that pig gator over there?
- Yeah.

577
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,061
- Wanna jump it?
- Yeah.

578
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:56,940
Whoo!

579
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:59,317
- See that chicken seal over there?
- Yeah.

580
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:00,610
- Wanna jump it?
- Yeah!

581
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,487
Whoo!

582
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,447
- You see that wall?
- Yeah!

583
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,491
- Wanna jump it?
- Yeah!

584
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:09,661
No! Eep, I'm not allowed
to go outside the wall!

585
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:12,497
Don't worry.
We'll be back before anyone knows.

586
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,057
Are you okay?

587
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,309
Whoo-hoo!

588
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:37,063
Oh, my gosh! My heart is pounding!
I feel so alive!

589
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:40,400
Let's jump more stuff.

590
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:44,195
Whoo!

591
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,865
Ready?

592
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:47,949
Let's do it.

593
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,453
Yeah!

594
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,455
Again! Something bigger!

595
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:54,831
Uh...

596
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,875
Oh! Mrs. Betterman.

597
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,669
We were just checking out this invention.
What's it for?

598
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,380
Um... It... W...

599
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:04,299
You know, why don't you ask Phil?

600
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:07,093
He spends a lot of time in there.

601
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:09,512
Anyway, here.

602
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,473
I thought you might want to have this.

603
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:14,184
It's some old pictures of our families.

604
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,187
Oh.

605
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,355
Thank you.

606
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:22,108
Whoa!

607
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,152
Where does this go?

608
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:28,656
Dad, what if I miss something?
I wanna go back inside.

609
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,951
No, Thunk. Play with Douglas.
He's feeling left out.

610
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:35,288
And he's sad that everyone isn't
spending time together anymore.

611
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,793
All right.
You wanna play fetch, Douglas?

612
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:43,296
Yeah? Okay. Okay. Go get it!

613
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,340
Oh!

614
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:47,759
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

615
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:49,844
I'm going back to the window!

616
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,890
Hey! There he is!

617
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,935
Grug! Over here, buddy.

618
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:58,812
Let's go for a ride.

619
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,897
Grug. Gruggers.

620
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,065
G-G-G-Grug.

621
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,149
Grug.

622
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,736
Grug? Grug.

623
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,530
Wanna go for that ride?

624
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,407
Pretty impressive, eh, Grug?

625
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,741
Funny story,

626
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:17,497
everything you see before you used to be
a sad, hopeless, dust-filled wasteland.

627
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,998
That doesn't sound funny.

628
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,334
But through the power of higher thought,

629
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:25,797
I devised a way to get all the water
from that high mountain source

630
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,007
to flow down here.

631
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,299
How interesting.

632
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:31,928
Yup, I turned a barren desert
into a lush oasis.

633
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:34,472
Now we have all the water we need
and then some.

634
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:36,975
Matter of fact, we're thinking of
putting in a new...

635
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,935
- Ooh, banana.
- No!

636
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,228
Ow.

637
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,438
What'd you do that for?

638
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:45,025
Sorry. I'm afraid I must remind you
of our one rule.

639
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,860
We don't eat the bananas.

640
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:50,196
Well, why not?
I mean, they're everywhere!

641
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,616
Look! You got a whole bowl full of them
over there. Who are those for?

642
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,077
Grug, we could talk about fruit all day.

643
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,370
Or...

644
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,664
do you wanna see something really cool?

645
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:00,999
I don't know.

646
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,139
Hey. Fixing yourself a snack?

647
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:21,186
Oh, I thought I'd clean up a little.
Noticed we made a bit of a mess yesterday.

648
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:25,190
Oh, no. I hadn't noticed.

649
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:28,193
Um, you can just put that over there
in the compost bin.

650
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,277
Oh, smart.

651
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,074
Good job.

652
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:38,661
Well, we didn't want you to think
we're a family of savages.

653
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:42,331
Savages.

654
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:44,250
Sandy, drop it.

655
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,710
Drop it!

656
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,588
Kids, right?

657
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:51,882
So, Ugga,
you must really miss the wild.

658
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:54,344
- Right? With the hunting...
- Not really.

659
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,763
- ...and the gathering...
- Not really.

660
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,682
...the baying at the moon.

661
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:01,393
Not at all.

662
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,104
Honestly, it sucks out there.

663
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:07,941
If no one's died before breakfast,
it's a win.

664
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,777
It is so much better in here.

665
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,070
Oh.

666
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,321
That's nice.

667
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:15,949
Yeah.

668
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:20,036
Actually, Grug and I were thinking
that maybe we...

669
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,789
Ah! I almost forgot. I made this for you.

670
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,332
- A basket?
- Mm-hmm.

671
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,377
Well, it's more like-like a travel basket.

672
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,837
Travel basket?

673
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,338
Yeah, for the road.

674
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:34,801
It's got fruit, nuts, soap, more soap
and a neck pillow.

675
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:39,139
Oh. Yeah. This'll be great...
for the road.

676
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:41,266
Thank you.

677
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:44,310
It's the least we can do
to thank you for bringing Guy home.

678
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:45,687
- Home?
- Home.

679
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,771
Guy?

680
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:48,189
Guy's home. You got it.

681
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,358
Well, gotta go.
See you at dinner, okay?

682
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:59,075
Yeah!

683
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:02,704
Whoo!

684
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,914
Ooh!

685
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,750
Huh? Whoa!

686
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:12,547
Whoa.

687
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,884
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

688
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:19,054
Yeah!

689
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,601
Whoa!

690
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,406
Ooh!

691
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,451
Ahh! Eep!

692
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,122
Eep?

693
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,224
Ow.

694
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:06,810
I have a scar.

695
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:07,936
You have a scar!

696
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:09,771
- I have a scar!
- Yeah!

697
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:11,022
Ow!

698
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:16,778
Don't tell Mrs. Betterman,

699
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:20,448
but while she thinks
I'm toiling in the hot sun,

700
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,367
I'm actually in here,

701
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,868
my man cave.

702
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:27,080
It's hot in here.

703
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:31,126
Grug, you might be more comfortable
if you removed your fur pelt.

704
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:32,544
I-I already did.

705
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:34,379
Right.

706
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:39,050
Yeah, it's a place a father
can escape the chaos of family life.

707
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,636
Relax, hang with his bros,

708
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,222
if bros he has.

709
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:45,890
Another shark milk?

710
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:50,645
So, you come in here
to hide from your family?

711
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:54,190
Not hide, help. I help my family.

712
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,739
So, uh,

713
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,365
how does this help your family?

714
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:03,825
Yeah.

715
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:08,329
This is where I find solutions
to my family's biggest problems.

716
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:10,915
Okay.

717
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:14,544
So, feeling relaxed? Comfortable?

718
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:17,047
Susceptible to suggestion?

719
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:20,592
What's your problem, big guy?

720
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:22,677
I don't have a problem.

721
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,221
Come on, Grug.
I've seen you moping around.

722
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:26,348
What's your problem?

723
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:28,433
I'm hot. That-That's my problem.

724
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:29,893
Knock, knock.

725
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:33,188
I'm knocking on the door, big guy.
Open it.

726
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:34,939
No.

727
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:37,275
- Open up to me.
- No.

728
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,528
- Share with me.
- Uh-uh. I don't wanna. I'm hot.

729
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:41,905
Tell me your problem.

730
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:43,406
I don't have a problem.

731
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,949
You have a problem.

732
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:47,243
Tell me your problem.

733
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:48,661
- I don't...
- Tell me.

734
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:49,621
- I don't...
- Tell me.

735
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,039
- I don't...
- Tell me. Tell me.

736
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:53,208
I don't like it here, all right?

737
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:56,086
My pack's all split up.
There's no one to sleep-pile with.

738
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:58,254
You won't let me eat bananas.

739
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:01,132
Guy gave Eep a rock.
He kissed my hand.

740
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:03,343
They're planning on leaving the pack.

741
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:04,928
And I don't like you at all!

742
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:07,138
Hmm. Now, that's interesting.

743
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:10,308
You know, maybe I just
need to get to know you better.

744
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:13,353
No, not that.
The part about Eep and Guy.

745
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:16,564
Oh. Guy's trying to take my daughter away.

746
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:19,776
Father to father,
I worry about my daughter too.

747
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:22,612
She was so lonely
before Guy came back.

748
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:23,822
Yeah.

749
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:26,408
It's almost like Guy's the problem.

750
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:29,828
Wait a minute. Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

751
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:31,705
Yes. No.

752
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:33,373
I don't know. Hot.

753
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:35,125
Are you suggesting...

754
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:38,878
...we take Guy off your hands
so Dawn isn't lonely,

755
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:41,881
and Eep stays with you,
with your pack?

756
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:44,718
Uh, am I?

757
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:47,762
Why, Grug, that's a truly great idea.

758
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:50,432
You've done it!
You've solved both our problems.

759
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:53,560
No. Really?

760
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:55,270
So, we have a deal, bro?

761
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,023
Deal.

762
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:06,698
Hey, Ugga!
I just had the best time with Phil!

763
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:09,909
Look at me.
Standing up straight, got lots of ideas.

764
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:11,578
You know, Phil's a good listener.

765
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:14,956
He knows a smart idea
when he hears... one.

766
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:19,544
Heh.

767
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:23,256
The Bettermans want us
to leave without Guy.

768
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,634
- Oh, um... You think so, huh?
- As if we would ever do that.

769
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:28,636
- Well...
- Guy's a member of our pack.

770
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,721
Kind of.

771
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:33,099
And can you imagine what that would do
to Eep? It would absolutely destroy her!

772
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,642
Well, initially.

773
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,728
They think we're just simple cave people.

774
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:39,981
That we're so stupid,
we'd trade Guy for a fruit basket.

775
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:43,651
And then she tried to
make me think it was my idea!

776
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:46,946
- That is a great idea.
- Betterman.

777
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,865
As if we'd ever do that!

778
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:51,117
- So we have a deal?
- Betterman.

779
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:53,203
They must think
we're pretty stupid.

780
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:56,331
You've done it, Grug. Thinking man.
You're not stupid.

781
00:40:56,414 --> 00:40:57,957
- Betterman!
- Betterman!

782
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,251
- Betterman!
- Betterman!

783
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:03,463
Betterman!

784
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,427
Maybe we should
take it down a notch, honey.

785
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:14,641
We gotta focus. We've gotta get Guy
and get out of here.

786
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:16,351
Okay. But first,

787
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:20,855
there's something I've wanted to do
for a really, really long time.

788
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:29,114
Ah. I can't believe they kept
these old picture albums.

789
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:30,990
That's the Bettermans.

790
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:34,953
Okay, this is my mom,
this is my dad, and that's me.

791
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:38,373
Yeah, I get it. I was skinny.

792
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:45,213
It's pretty great here, huh, Belt?

793
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:48,800
Shh!

794
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:58,435
Whee!

795
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:00,770
Shh.

796
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:05,233
Is that my dad? Hide me!

797
00:42:05,316 --> 00:42:06,526
Mr. Betterman?

798
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:09,112
"Mr. Betterman"?

799
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:12,782
It's just Guy. Hi, Guy!

800
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:14,075
Hey, you.

801
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,578
- Where'd you go?
- Took Chunky for a joyride.

802
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:18,788
- Joyride!
- Joyride?

803
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,331
We rolled the death...

804
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:21,833
- Outside the wall.
- ...cat!

805
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:25,337
You took Dawn for a joyride

806
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,130
- outside the wall?
- Yeah.

807
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:29,382
The Bettermans don't want Dawn
outside the wall.

808
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:32,886
They built the wall for a reason,
you know, to keep everyone safe.

809
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:34,304
Guy, relax.

810
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:38,016
Yeah, Guy, take it down low.

811
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:39,809
What's wrong with her?

812
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:41,644
It's just a reaction to the bee venom.

813
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,938
- Bee venom?
- Bee venom!

814
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,148
What the...

815
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:48,109
- It's just a little bee sting.
- "Little"?

816
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:51,196
Hey, you're not the boss of me.

817
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:52,405
This is a very severe...

818
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:53,782
Shh.

819
00:42:53,865 --> 00:42:56,743
Eep, this is a very severe bee sting!

820
00:42:56,826 --> 00:42:58,953
- "This is a very severe bee sting."
- She's fine.

821
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:00,330
No, no. She's not fine.

822
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,082
- I'm fine.
- Dawn!

823
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:05,877
Eep, that was not smart.
She could have been seriously hurt.

824
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,879
You gotta think about these things!

825
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:10,548
Why are you acting like this?
You like adventures.

826
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:14,135
No! No. I like not dying.
Things are different now.

827
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:16,388
But she needed to get out.

828
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:19,057
She's just like me.
This is her cave!

829
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,685
No, she's not like you.
This is not her cave!

830
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:23,144
She's not a cave girl.

831
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:26,523
"Cave girl"?

832
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:33,947
What does he mean by "cave girl"?

833
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,824
I'll give him a cave girl!

834
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,751
I trust you've all brought your appetites.

835
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:49,004
Chef Hope's been working hard all day.

836
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:52,132
Mmm.
This is so good, Mrs. Better-mom.

837
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:54,968
You're eating the flower arrangement.

838
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,513
Wow.

839
00:43:58,596 --> 00:44:01,433
Uh, Grug, Ugga,
what can we offer you?

840
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:02,642
Ah, we're good.

841
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:05,311
Yeah, we ate a little something
on the way over.

842
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:07,439
Oops. Pardon me.

843
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:08,898
Eh...

844
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:10,108
Okay.

845
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:11,192
Oh, look!

846
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,445
- Oh!
- Guy and Dawn are here...

847
00:44:13,528 --> 00:44:15,280
...together.

848
00:44:16,948 --> 00:44:18,324
You good to do this?

849
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:20,452
Just try to keep your giant hand
out of sight.

850
00:44:20,535 --> 00:44:21,619
- Gotcha!
- Ah!

851
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:29,544
Oh, welcome, Eep.
Your seat is over here, next to...

852
00:44:29,627 --> 00:44:30,628
Gran.

853
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:35,300
We're not done.
You called me a cave girl.

854
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:38,053
But y-y-you are a cave girl.

855
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:42,515
But you said "cave girl"
like it's a bad thing.

856
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,769
What's wrong with cave people, Guy?

857
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:47,604
There's nothing wrong with cave people.

858
00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:49,397
Can I get you a towel
or a utensil or something?

859
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:53,610
I'm good.

860
00:44:53,693 --> 00:44:55,028
Why are you acting like this?

861
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:57,030
I'm just acting like a cave girl, Guy.

862
00:44:57,113 --> 00:44:59,115
But I guess that's not good enough
for you anymore.

863
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:00,241
I never said that.

864
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:03,078
Grug, let's take this moment
to talk about your great idea.

865
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:04,245
Uh, what?

866
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:06,122
Grug felt, and I concurred,

867
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:09,501
that Guy should be
with his kind of people, evolved people.

868
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:11,294
And Eep should stay with her kind.

869
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:14,339
- So we made a deal.
- Say again?

870
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:15,465
- What deal?
- His deal!

871
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:18,301
- Your idea.
- Your idea?

872
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,804
Guy stays with us,
and Eep stays with her pack.

873
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:22,180
Grug's words, not mine.

874
00:45:22,263 --> 00:45:24,599
- You tried to get rid of me?
- Really, Dad?

875
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:26,101
No! Honey, I don't think that.

876
00:45:26,184 --> 00:45:28,478
I mean, he made me think
that I thought that.

877
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:29,979
He tricked me!

878
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:32,107
He took me
into his stupid secret man cave,

879
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,483
and he tricked me.

880
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:34,901
What's a man cave?

881
00:45:34,984 --> 00:45:37,696
It's a place I go to get away.

882
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:38,988
Away from what?

883
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:41,074
Away from you! Duh!

884
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:43,243
- What?
- We're all thinking it.

885
00:45:43,326 --> 00:45:45,203
- How dare you?
- How dare you!

886
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:46,746
How dare the both of you!

887
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,332
You're trying to fix me up with Guy?

888
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,834
What happened to your hand?

889
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:52,711
Oh. I got stung by a bee. Oh!

890
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:54,421
Outside the wall. Oh!

891
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:56,923
- You went outside the wall?
- Outside the wall?

892
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:59,217
- This is all your fault!
- Oh! Our fault?

893
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,301
Can I say something?

894
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:01,511
- No!
- Okay.

895
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:03,680
I can't believe
you actually made that deal.

896
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:06,224
- What did they do to you?
- I got scars.

897
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:07,517
Our baby!

898
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,977
It was really hot.

899
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,855
I was full of shark milk.
I was naked!

900
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:13,523
Why, Phil? Why?

901
00:46:13,606 --> 00:46:17,444
Because privacy promotes individuality!
Unofficial motto!

902
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:20,071
Well, kiddo, looks like
we all have something to hide.

903
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:27,245
That's it! Come on, Guy. We're leaving.

904
00:46:27,328 --> 00:46:29,956
Wait, hold on a second.
First, you wanted to get rid of me, Grug,

905
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,750
and now you want me to come with you?

906
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,335
You were trying to take my daughter away!

907
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:36,629
Promising my baby girl butterflies
and babbling brooks.

908
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:38,006
Aha!

909
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:39,841
You see? I knew you were listening.

910
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:41,801
There is no privacy with you people.

911
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:43,887
Oh, you mean cave people?

912
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,055
Not what I said.

913
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:49,184
Positives, Eep, that's all I'm saying.
Lots of things here are better.

914
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:53,563
- "Better"?
- Like not starving, no sleep pile.

915
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:57,901
- What's wrong with the sleep pile?
- Oh, come on, Eep! The sleep pile reeks!

916
00:46:57,984 --> 00:46:59,235
Reeks of love!

917
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:02,322
Well, at least I smell like me.

918
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:04,532
I don't even know what you smell like.

919
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:06,201
Flowers and soft rain.

920
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:08,119
I don't even know who you are anymore!

921
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:11,247
With your vanilla
and your stupid neck rock!

922
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:14,042
It's this place. This place is...

923
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,544
Home! This place is home!

924
00:47:17,253 --> 00:47:18,254
"Home"?

925
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:20,924
This is the place
my parents wanted me to find!

926
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:22,759
This is Tomorrow.

927
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:27,972
Well, clearly,
I don't belong in this Tomorrow.

928
00:47:30,183 --> 00:47:31,768
I'm leaving.

929
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:33,061
Are you coming with me?

930
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:34,938
I, um...

931
00:47:35,897 --> 00:47:37,023
I can't.

932
00:47:40,568 --> 00:47:42,821
Then I guess we have
two different Tomorrows.

933
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,371
Eep.

934
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:01,381
So, who's ready for dessert?

935
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:02,590
I told you,

936
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:05,135
we're not hungry!

937
00:48:05,218 --> 00:48:06,761
You ate a banana?

938
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:09,973
Nuh-uh. We ate all the bananas.

939
00:48:10,598 --> 00:48:14,185
That's impossible.

940
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,187
Not for cave people.

941
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:18,481
What have you done?

942
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:20,567
They're just bananas, Phil.

943
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,111
"Just bananas"?
"Just bananas," she says!

944
00:48:23,194 --> 00:48:24,821
That was my one rule!

945
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:27,323
Wait, we're not done.

946
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,701
There was more
I was planning on saying to you!

947
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:33,705
Mrs. Better-mom,
I'll just take my dessert at the window.

948
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:37,417
You kidding me?
I've lived with her family for how long?

949
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,587
With the... With the dirt and the smell.

950
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,716
Eep? Eep, is that... you?

951
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:49,012
I don't know.

952
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,974
- Did you hit him?
- No.

953
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:54,225
I thought about it.

954
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:57,604
The bananas were key to our survival.

955
00:48:57,687 --> 00:49:03,109
The bananas were keeping us safe.

956
00:49:03,193 --> 00:49:04,819
Safe from what?

957
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:10,283
It's here...

958
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:11,951
for the bananas!

959
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:13,411
What is, Phil?

960
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:16,414
It has come every night
for 100 moons or more.

961
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:22,671
<i>I found bananas are the only thing
that keeps it at bay.</i>

962
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:29,469
What's on the other side
of the wall, Phil?

963
00:49:29,552 --> 00:49:33,223
<i>Night after night, it was never enough!</i>

964
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:41,731
It wants its bananas!

965
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:44,150
What's behind the wall, Phil?

966
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:45,777
What is it, Phil?

967
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:49,531
- What are the bananas for?
- What is it?

968
00:49:49,614 --> 00:49:52,200
I don't know!

969
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:04,587
Huh?

970
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:08,299
It's just a little punch monkey.

971
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:11,094
I'm leaving.

972
00:50:11,177 --> 00:50:13,388
You just kept giving it bananas?

973
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:18,059
Wait, wait. Let me understand something.

974
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:21,896
You had no idea you were working...

975
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:24,899
for an itty-bitty monkey?

976
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:32,115
Giving it bananas for years!

977
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:44,294
That's not good.

978
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,090
No, no, no! Get away!

979
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:51,843
Phil!

980
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:57,682
Come on, come on, come on!

981
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:09,361
Oh, Douglas, those flowers
did not agree with me.

982
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:11,279
What'd I miss?

983
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:15,909
Hey, Mrs. Better-mom,
wasn't there a wall there before?

984
00:51:19,704 --> 00:51:20,705
Phil?

985
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:22,832
Dad? Guy?

986
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:23,958
Grug?

987
00:51:25,835 --> 00:51:27,087
It's gone.

988
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,631
The wall is gone. Phil's gone.

989
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:32,759
Oh, my gosh. Something has taken him,
taken all of them.

990
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:34,135
What are we gonna do?

991
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:37,514
No sign of them.
But I did find this though.

992
00:51:37,597 --> 00:51:40,225
- Is that my basket?
- Good eye.

993
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:42,560
Sandy can track them with this.

994
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:43,937
Sandy, seek.

995
00:51:45,146 --> 00:51:46,147
Okay, right.

996
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:49,192
You guys go, and Dawn and I
will stay here and fix the wall.

997
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:52,529
Or better yet, Dawn, let's get you
back inside your panic cubby.

998
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:55,281
In fact, I think we can both fit
if we suck it in.

999
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:57,617
She's got the scent.

1000
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:59,452
Whatever took them
couldn't have gotten far.

1001
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:01,746
Mom,

1002
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:03,331
I'm going too.

1003
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:06,918
Dawn, listen to yourself!
We are not like them.

1004
00:52:07,002 --> 00:52:08,503
Dad needs us.

1005
00:52:08,586 --> 00:52:10,296
Wait. Dawn!

1006
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,719
Dawn, you'll need the travel basket.

1007
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:17,095
It has a neck pillow.

1008
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:19,389
Where are you taking us?

1009
00:52:19,472 --> 00:52:20,515
Stop talking!

1010
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:23,059
If you're going to eat us,

1011
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:25,937
you should eat the fat one first.
He ate your bananas.

1012
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:27,731
Oh, don't you blame me for this.

1013
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:29,774
- This is all your fault!
- My fault?

1014
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:31,192
Tell him, Guy!

1015
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:34,070
She says I changed.

1016
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:36,865
I didn't change!
This is the real me, baby!

1017
00:52:36,948 --> 00:52:38,867
You know? You know what I'm saying?

1018
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:41,995
What you see, that's what you get.
That's what you...

1019
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:43,872
There you are. I lost you for a second.

1020
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:45,832
Anyway, I don't need anybody.
No one at all.

1021
00:52:45,915 --> 00:52:49,878
Ow! Fine! Wasn't much
of a conversation anyway.

1022
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:53,006
Guess it's just me with my thoughts.

1023
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:54,341
Travel log.

1024
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:56,843
Literally, I'm traveling in a log.

1025
00:52:56,926 --> 00:52:58,970
So, it's been a while. A little update.

1026
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:00,680
<i>Remember that Tomorrow?</i>

1027
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:03,475
<i>You know, the one
I spent my whole life looking for?</i>

1028
00:53:03,558 --> 00:53:07,312
<i>Well, turns out, the girl I love
wants nothing to do with it...</i>

1029
00:53:07,395 --> 00:53:08,396
<i>or me.</i>

1030
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,149
<i>Girls, very, very complicated.</i>

1031
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:13,985
<i>Dear diary. Hey, it's me.</i>

1032
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:16,071
<i>Remember what I said about fate?</i>

1033
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:18,990
<i>Well, fate's dumb and a liar</i>.

1034
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:21,284
<i>Fate thinks it's better than you.</i>

1035
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:23,411
<i>Fate wants to stay with...</i>

1036
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:27,040
<i>The Bettermans! They're amazing.
I mean, have you seen their tree house?</i>

1037
00:53:27,123 --> 00:53:29,668
<i>What's so great about living in a tree?</i>

1038
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:32,212
<i>Showers, instant fire,
so much food, and...</i>

1039
00:53:32,295 --> 00:53:33,713
<i>"Privacy."</i>

1040
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:35,131
<i>Well, one thing's clear.</i>

1041
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:36,758
- It's over!
- ...over!

1042
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:37,967
- Fine!
- Fine!

1043
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:39,302
- Who cares?
- Not me.

1044
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:49,020
Are you okay?

1045
00:53:49,104 --> 00:53:51,773
- Huh?
- It's so bright out here.

1046
00:53:51,856 --> 00:53:54,859
I just need to watch the window for a...
I just need to watch it for a minute!

1047
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,780
Oh.

1048
00:53:58,863 --> 00:54:00,782
Hey, my travel basket!

1049
00:54:00,865 --> 00:54:03,576
Travel window.

1050
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:07,580
Ugga, can you tell your son to keep
his grubby hands off my stuff, please?

1051
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:10,375
Listen, I feel really bad
about what happened at dinner

1052
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:12,961
with my parents, and you, and Guy.

1053
00:54:13,044 --> 00:54:14,546
Oh.

1054
00:54:14,629 --> 00:54:17,465
Please, I'm good. It's in the past!

1055
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:21,678
You know, Guy and I, we're too different.

1056
00:54:21,761 --> 00:54:26,349
Well, you and I are different,
and we get along great, right?

1057
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:27,809
Yeah, yeah.

1058
00:54:27,892 --> 00:54:30,145
But it's-it's complicated.

1059
00:54:30,228 --> 00:54:31,813
He's a boy.

1060
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:34,983
He is... um... stupid.

1061
00:54:35,066 --> 00:54:36,317
You know, it's different.

1062
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:38,820
What's the matter? Boy problems?

1063
00:54:38,903 --> 00:54:42,240
Well, in my day,
we didn't have boy problems.

1064
00:54:42,323 --> 00:54:47,078
Because we didn't have any boys,
or men, or clothes.

1065
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:50,999
We were a warrior tribe of wimmins.

1066
00:54:51,082 --> 00:54:53,710
The Thunder Sisters!

1067
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:56,963
What's a Thunder Sister?

1068
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:59,841
Just Gran's old bedtime stories.

1069
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:01,176
True stories!

1070
00:55:01,259 --> 00:55:04,637
Okay. Dawn, stop talking
to the crazy lady. Whoa!

1071
00:55:05,263 --> 00:55:07,724
We aren't actually
gonna cross that, are we?

1072
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:09,684
Yes. Sandy's tracking the scent.

1073
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:12,145
Well, there's gotta be another way.
You know?

1074
00:55:12,228 --> 00:55:16,775
Maybe one that's stable
and not infested with land sharks!

1075
00:55:16,858 --> 00:55:17,859
Tell you what,

1076
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:21,571
you be in charge of gift baskets,
and I'll be in charge of tracking the men.

1077
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:22,655
We cross!

1078
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:26,076
Oh, no, no, no. We are not crossing this!

1079
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,328
My cat, my rules. We cross!

1080
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:30,997
- Maybe we should take a vote?
- Around!

1081
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:33,249
- Whoa!
- Cross!

1082
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,709
Around!

1083
00:55:35,293 --> 00:55:37,212
- Cross!
- No!

1084
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:42,133
Sandy, come!

1085
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:47,847
Thank you, Hope. This is so much safer.

1086
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:52,102
I can't see!

1087
00:55:52,185 --> 00:55:53,478
What's happening?

1088
00:55:53,561 --> 00:55:55,230
Where are they taking us?

1089
00:55:55,313 --> 00:55:57,857
Hold tight, Guy.
As soon as we get out of this log,

1090
00:55:57,941 --> 00:56:00,860
I'll start swinging and punching
our way to freedom.

1091
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:10,036
Come on, punch monkeys! Let's get this on!

1092
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:20,171
It's-It's not just punch monkeys.

1093
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:21,423
It's kick monkeys,

1094
00:56:21,506 --> 00:56:24,050
headbutt monkeys, low-blow monkeys,

1095
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:26,094
bite monkeys, ab-tight monkeys!

1096
00:56:26,177 --> 00:56:28,638
Shoulders that punch! Tails that crunch!

1097
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:31,850
Deranged stranglers! Strange danglers!
Fanged manglers!

1098
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:34,185
Mouth-breathers! Brain squeezers!

1099
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:35,979
And a dude with...

1100
00:56:36,604 --> 00:56:37,647
weird eyes.

1101
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:40,233
Mmm.

1102
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,584
Hmm.

1103
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:00,837
They seem to have
some kind of primitive language.

1104
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,173
But you can't speak it,
huh, smarty-pants?

1105
00:57:03,256 --> 00:57:06,551
Well, no. But I'm sure
after a few months in captivity...

1106
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:09,679
I can talk to them.
I'm fluent in punch monkey.

1107
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:11,431
- You are?
- Impossible.

1108
00:57:11,514 --> 00:57:14,392
Oh, I really don't want to do this.
It's not a pretty language.

1109
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:19,189
Pardon me, I'd like to ask...

1110
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:22,984
Hmm.

1111
00:57:23,693 --> 00:57:25,070
Uh-huh.

1112
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:26,946
- Ooh! I see.
- So, what's he saying?

1113
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:31,826
They're angry because
Phil broke the terms of their contract!

1114
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:34,954
Ludicrous! We had no formal agreement,
you chiselers!

1115
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:37,749
Oh! Also, they want their bananas.

1116
00:57:37,832 --> 00:57:41,920
Yeah, bananas are delicious.
Why is that our problem?

1117
00:57:42,003 --> 00:57:44,005
And one more question.

1118
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,888
Many moons ago,
their world was a paradise.

1119
00:57:51,971 --> 00:57:53,848
This is gonna be a long story.

1120
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:56,726
<i>"It was a time of much joy.</i>

1121
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,895
<i>The water flowed freely.</i>

1122
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:01,231
<i>The bananas grew in bunches.</i>

1123
00:58:01,314 --> 00:58:03,983
<i>We had art, politics...</i>

1124
00:58:04,067 --> 00:58:06,111
- <i>...economics...</i>
- Ooh.

1125
00:58:06,194 --> 00:58:08,196
<i>...but most of all, bananas.</i>

1126
00:58:08,279 --> 00:58:10,490
<i>So many bananas.</i>

1127
00:58:10,573 --> 00:58:12,450
<i>Then, at full moon,</i>

1128
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:14,619
<i>the monster came for its bananas.</i>

1129
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:17,205
<i>Yep. Good times."</i>

1130
00:58:17,288 --> 00:58:19,999
- Wait. Um, go back.
- Yeah. Did he say "monster"?

1131
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:22,669
We are not going back!
As I was saying...

1132
00:58:22,752 --> 00:58:24,087
<i>"Good times.</i>

1133
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:28,425
<i>But then, for some strange reason,
the water went away.</i>

1134
00:58:28,508 --> 00:58:31,553
<i>After that, the bananas went away too.</i>

1135
00:58:31,636 --> 00:58:34,097
<i>But the monster didn't go away. No.</i>

1136
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:37,100
<i>It came back for its bananas.</i>

1137
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,685
<i>There were no bananas."</i>

1138
00:58:45,483 --> 00:58:48,945
In summary,
they really need those bananas.

1139
00:58:49,529 --> 00:58:51,364
Monsters, bananas.

1140
00:58:51,448 --> 00:58:55,618
I'll tell you what their problem is.
Their water supply is dried up.

1141
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:57,620
Tell them this word-for-word, Guy.

1142
00:58:57,704 --> 00:59:01,666
I, Phil Betterman, single-handedly
turned a desert into an oasis

1143
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,502
by diverting water
from a high mountain source,

1144
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:07,047
much like that... one.

1145
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,548
Wait, Guy, don't translate that.

1146
00:59:11,676 --> 00:59:14,095
Too late.

1147
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,015
It was all him!

1148
00:59:17,098 --> 00:59:20,185
He stole your water, ate your bananas
and ruined your society!

1149
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:24,606
That's it! I will not be pelted!

1150
00:59:25,815 --> 00:59:28,318
Now, impertinent apes...

1151
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:31,029
...meet the full force of my intellect.

1152
00:59:31,112 --> 00:59:35,533
Look upon Betterman the toolmaker
and despair!

1153
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:36,785
Jab, jab.

1154
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:39,704
Ooh!

1155
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:48,254
Jab, jab, jab.

1156
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:49,923
Way to go, Phil.

1157
00:59:51,132 --> 00:59:53,968
Way to go, Hope. We lost the scent.

1158
00:59:57,597 --> 01:00:00,058
No, no, no! Travel window!

1159
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:02,686
Come on, come on. Whoo!

1160
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:04,270
It still works, everybody!

1161
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:07,232
We are lost.

1162
01:00:07,315 --> 01:00:10,860
This is why you don't follow cave people.
One more word out of...

1163
01:00:10,944 --> 01:00:14,406
We have forgotten the old ways,

1164
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:18,326
the ways of the world when it was young,
and I was young,

1165
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:25,417
when I was the queen matriarch
of a warrior tribe of wimmins.

1166
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,043
The Thunder Sisters.

1167
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:30,380
You got it, girl.
The Thunder Sisters.

1168
01:00:30,463 --> 01:00:34,050
We faced down danger
and kicked death in the crotch!

1169
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:38,513
We don't need the Thunder Sisters, Mom.
We need a way to find the men!

1170
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:40,432
Oh, a way?

1171
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:43,643
The Thunder Sisters always find a way!

1172
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,979
Think you got one more flight
in you, old girl?

1173
01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:50,275
Oh, my goodness.

1174
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:55,321
Fly, Wigasus, fly!

1175
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:56,948
Go.

1176
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:58,825
Go and find them, Wigasus.

1177
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:02,078
That is it!

1178
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:04,247
You are all crazy!

1179
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:07,042
And you know what?
That hair's not coming back. It escaped.

1180
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,044
Which is what we need to be doing,
Dawn.

1181
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:12,047
Getting away from these crazy...
cave people!

1182
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:13,131
Mom!

1183
01:01:13,214 --> 01:01:15,550
You came barging
into our lives uninvited,

1184
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:18,928
without even wiping
your disgusting... feet!

1185
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:23,808
And peeping Thunk over here,
with his dumb... window.

1186
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:25,560
This show is for older kids.

1187
01:01:25,643 --> 01:01:27,979
And that flea-infested rat baby!

1188
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:29,731
- Mmm?
- You dumb baby.

1189
01:01:29,814 --> 01:01:31,316
Okay. I'm gonna kill her.

1190
01:01:31,399 --> 01:01:33,109
Hey, hey, hey. Chill.

1191
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:34,569
And you!

1192
01:01:34,652 --> 01:01:38,531
Taking my daughter outside the wall,
giving her scars and stupid ideas!

1193
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:40,784
Mom!
Don't talk to my friend that way.

1194
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:42,494
And I'm glad Guy came to his senses

1195
01:01:42,577 --> 01:01:44,704
and realized he doesn't belong
with a cave girl.

1196
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:47,040
He belongs with us,
the Bettermans!

1197
01:01:47,123 --> 01:01:48,583
Let's go, Dawn!

1198
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:50,460
Mom, where are you going?

1199
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:52,712
Got to get away!

1200
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:55,048
Cave people!

1201
01:02:02,263 --> 01:02:03,515
Oh, no.

1202
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,686
What is that?

1203
01:02:17,028 --> 01:02:18,029
Eep!

1204
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:22,701
Get him, Eep! Get him!

1205
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:25,370
- Mom!
- There she is!

1206
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:29,499
We're coming for you, ice lady!

1207
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:42,804
Kill circle!

1208
01:02:42,887 --> 01:02:45,974
Come on, stabby. Time to get stabbing.

1209
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:53,940
Guys, wait a minute.

1210
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:55,817
Everyone lower your weapons.

1211
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,319
Dawn. What is she doing?

1212
01:02:58,403 --> 01:02:59,988
Trust her. Lower your weapons.

1213
01:03:03,366 --> 01:03:05,827
Come here, little guy.
You can come out.

1214
01:03:07,328 --> 01:03:09,456
Yeah. It's okay. You got it.

1215
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:14,210
This isn't a monster.

1216
01:03:14,294 --> 01:03:15,503
It's a mom

1217
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:19,924
who was just afraid for her baby
and being protective,

1218
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:22,677
and maybe a bit, uh, rude.

1219
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:26,681
And maybe she just didn't realize

1220
01:03:26,765 --> 01:03:30,852
that the outsiders weren't a threat
but actually...

1221
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:32,312
friends.

1222
01:03:32,395 --> 01:03:33,897
And that maybe,

1223
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,650
the wolf spiders and outsiders
could live in beautiful harmony together

1224
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,861
in their tree house!

1225
01:03:39,944 --> 01:03:41,279
I mean ice cave.

1226
01:03:42,322 --> 01:03:43,323
Whoa.

1227
01:03:43,406 --> 01:03:46,868
You got all that
just from looking at them?

1228
01:03:46,951 --> 01:03:51,790
Perhaps the window
by which I view the world is flawed.

1229
01:03:52,999 --> 01:03:54,959
I'm gonna go pet them.

1230
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,463
Oh, look,
they're hugging me with their teeth!

1231
01:03:58,546 --> 01:03:59,714
Ow!

1232
01:04:10,684 --> 01:04:12,686
- Guy.
- Eep?

1233
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:15,063
- Guy.
- Eep, you came back!

1234
01:04:15,146 --> 01:04:16,356
No.

1235
01:04:17,065 --> 01:04:18,566
You made your choice.

1236
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:22,320
- No. That's not what I wanted!
- Enjoy your... Tomorrow!

1237
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:24,197
Eep! Come back!

1238
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,281
No!

1239
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:40,422
Grug, do you mind?
I'm trying to think!

1240
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:45,010
Well, I'm trying to get out of here
before that monster shows up!

1241
01:04:46,386 --> 01:04:48,763
There's no monster,
you bonehead.

1242
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:51,558
They just want to... scare us.

1243
01:04:51,641 --> 01:04:52,642
That's it!

1244
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:56,271
Time to strike fear
into the hearts of these apes.

1245
01:05:03,653 --> 01:05:08,116
Look upon Betterman the fire maker
and despair!

1246
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:09,200
Flame, flame!

1247
01:05:12,537 --> 01:05:15,165
Great. Now they have spears and fire.

1248
01:05:15,248 --> 01:05:17,667
Guy, he just gave the monkeys fire!

1249
01:05:30,513 --> 01:05:33,600
You ready? And shake.

1250
01:05:33,683 --> 01:05:35,185
Oh. And shake!

1251
01:05:36,811 --> 01:05:39,356
And shake, and shake, and shake,
and shake, and shake!

1252
01:05:39,439 --> 01:05:42,150
Hey, Gran?
Are you sure this is safe?

1253
01:05:42,233 --> 01:05:45,320
Don't worry. It won't hurt... much.

1254
01:05:45,403 --> 01:05:48,823
- Where's Eep?
- She went off to get more firewood.

1255
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:51,326
- I'm gonna go find her.
- Ugga, help me.

1256
01:05:51,409 --> 01:05:52,994
Shh.

1257
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:54,412
Eep?

1258
01:05:54,496 --> 01:05:56,373
Eep?

1259
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:12,806
Oh, hey!

1260
01:06:12,889 --> 01:06:13,932
I'm just...

1261
01:06:14,432 --> 01:06:16,184
I'm just getting some firewood.

1262
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:21,106
I think you've got it covered.

1263
01:06:21,189 --> 01:06:24,609
Do you wanna take a break
from beating up the forest?

1264
01:06:31,658 --> 01:06:33,451
Are you ready to talk about it?

1265
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:44,295
I can't believe
he would choose a tree over me.

1266
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:46,756
I don't think it's that simple.

1267
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,260
Guy knew the Bettermans
when he was little.

1268
01:06:50,343 --> 01:06:53,179
They're the closest thing
he has to a family.

1269
01:06:55,598 --> 01:06:58,101
Every time I've been hurt before...

1270
01:06:59,227 --> 01:07:02,647
I've gotten a mark I can see.

1271
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:06,067
This hurts so much,

1272
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:08,236
and I can't even see it.

1273
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,030
I can see it.

1274
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:13,533
Doesn't matter.

1275
01:07:13,616 --> 01:07:15,410
We're just too different.

1276
01:07:16,202 --> 01:07:17,704
I don't even care.

1277
01:07:18,538 --> 01:07:22,083
Eep, if something hurts this much,

1278
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:24,210
maybe it means you do care.

1279
01:07:24,961 --> 01:07:28,340
Maybe it's something worth fighting for.

1280
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:32,844
So, what are you gonna do about it?

1281
01:07:40,518 --> 01:07:44,022
Mom, you sure you don't wanna join us?
It's really warm in here.

1282
01:07:44,105 --> 01:07:46,566
Uh, I'm not really a sleep-pile person.

1283
01:07:46,649 --> 01:07:50,904
I have a shawl to keep me... warm.
That's okay.

1284
01:07:50,987 --> 01:07:54,407
I'll just use the travel basket
to shield mys...

1285
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:56,368
Aw, come on!

1286
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:07,379
It's cozy, isn't it?

1287
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:09,547
- Mmm.
- Told ya.

1288
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:16,554
Hey, um, Ugga?

1289
01:08:17,138 --> 01:08:18,723
- Eep?
- Hmm?

1290
01:08:18,807 --> 01:08:20,350
Hi.

1291
01:08:20,433 --> 01:08:22,519
I just wanna say, um...

1292
01:08:23,812 --> 01:08:26,147
that I have been terrible.

1293
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:32,529
After everything I did and said,
you still saved me.

1294
01:08:32,612 --> 01:08:33,613
Why?

1295
01:08:34,197 --> 01:08:37,033
Well, we always say
the pack stays together.

1296
01:08:37,617 --> 01:08:38,785
Unofficial motto.

1297
01:08:38,868 --> 01:08:40,203
It's okay.

1298
01:08:40,953 --> 01:08:45,500
- No. It is not okay. I was awful.
- It's fine.

1299
01:08:45,582 --> 01:08:47,502
- I tried to steal Guy from you.
- It's okay.

1300
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:50,755
And I gave you
a passive-aggressive basket.

1301
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:51,881
Yeah, that was weird.

1302
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:53,508
Who does that?

1303
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:58,680
And your daughter, obviously,
is not a rat baby.

1304
01:08:58,763 --> 01:09:00,055
She's beautiful.

1305
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:04,394
She is a beautiful human baby.

1306
01:09:04,477 --> 01:09:06,020
- And...
- Enough!

1307
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:17,198
Where's Guy?

1308
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,743
I think I'm his new pet.

1309
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:23,121
Oh, that's rough.

1310
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:27,625
What's he saying, Guy?

1311
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:30,377
The aged wise one has decreed,

1312
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:33,131
because we have no bananas
for the monster,

1313
01:09:33,214 --> 01:09:35,716
you will be...

1314
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,219
I think I can translate from here, Guy.

1315
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:43,640
They're saying the oafish caveman
will grow bananas for them,

1316
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:46,770
watering the fields with his bitter tears.

1317
01:09:46,853 --> 01:09:50,814
Oh. And naturally,
they want me to supervise.

1318
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:51,899
Not what they said.

1319
01:09:51,983 --> 01:09:53,693
You can't speak punch monkey.

1320
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:55,070
Can I not?

1321
01:09:55,153 --> 01:10:00,283
{\an8}Monkeys, I have mastered your zesty
and expressive language.

1322
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:01,409
{\an8}No, you haven't.

1323
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:06,539
{\an8}Let me talk a little punch monkey.
Phil Betterman is so smart, he's stupid!

1324
01:10:06,623 --> 01:10:09,709
{\an8}Oh, what do you have to say
to this witty rejoinder?

1325
01:10:11,252 --> 01:10:13,672
{\an8}You know what? Let me fix this.

1326
01:10:13,755 --> 01:10:16,091
Do you mind? Can I take this? Thanks.

1327
01:10:16,174 --> 01:10:18,176
- Do not interrupt me!
- You stop interrupting me!

1328
01:10:18,259 --> 01:10:20,762
Will you two stop it?
I'm trying to get us out of this!

1329
01:10:20,845 --> 01:10:23,473
I'm in good with these monkeys.
I have a job!

1330
01:10:23,556 --> 01:10:25,392
And you two, you're gonna mess it up!

1331
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:26,768
Like you mess up everything!

1332
01:10:26,851 --> 01:10:30,689
Like you messed up
my beautiful teenage romance.

1333
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:38,238
Guy, son, please understand.

1334
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:40,156
It's Grug's fault.

1335
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:43,284
Huh?

1336
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:45,745
- Get him, Guy!
- I am not on your side!

1337
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:47,622
- Yeah, he's with me!
- I'm not on yours either!

1338
01:10:49,457 --> 01:10:50,709
Oh.

1339
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:54,921
I recognize those broad shoulders.

1340
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:57,549
Oh, Eep, you came for me. Boop.

1341
01:10:57,632 --> 01:10:59,300
Ah!

1342
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:08,560
Mmm.

1343
01:11:09,894 --> 01:11:11,521
What are you doing?

1344
01:11:12,564 --> 01:11:14,024
Where you going, Phil?

1345
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:18,653
No man cave here.

1346
01:11:18,737 --> 01:11:22,157
You can hide from your family...

1347
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,786
...but you can't hide from me.

1348
01:11:28,663 --> 01:11:31,541
Well, your precious pack...

1349
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,336
is glad you're gone...

1350
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:37,005
because you smother them.

1351
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:41,760
Oh!
Well, you built a wall around your family.

1352
01:11:41,843 --> 01:11:43,970
But you also built a wall

1353
01:11:44,054 --> 01:11:46,931
around your heart.

1354
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:48,183
Oh!

1355
01:11:48,266 --> 01:11:49,976
You know what you are?

1356
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,561
I'll tell you what you are.

1357
01:11:51,644 --> 01:11:52,979
- You're...
- A bad...

1358
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:54,189
Father!

1359
01:12:00,945 --> 01:12:03,239
Words as weapons?

1360
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:04,783
You're just a cave girl.

1361
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:06,868
It's called a shower. Try it.

1362
01:12:06,951 --> 01:12:09,579
I told her to take a shower.
Who does that?

1363
01:12:09,662 --> 01:12:10,997
You did.

1364
01:12:11,706 --> 01:12:12,832
Oh, Eep.

1365
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,669
Congratulations, Phil.

1366
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:18,088
You hit me where it hurts.

1367
01:12:18,171 --> 01:12:20,799
Likewise.

1368
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:22,801
Hey, Phil! Hey!

1369
01:12:22,884 --> 01:12:24,177
Hello, Grug!

1370
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:27,013
Grug, am I hallucinating?

1371
01:12:27,764 --> 01:12:30,892
No. Guy's a giant banana.

1372
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,061
What the monkeys were trying to say

1373
01:12:33,144 --> 01:12:37,023
was that we're gonna be sacrificed
to the monster at full moon tonight.

1374
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:47,117
She's still waiting out there.

1375
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,161
I'm not sure her hair
is coming back.

1376
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:02,757
Ooh.
How long was I out for?

1377
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:06,177
What are you guys all staring at?

1378
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:13,727
Mom!

1379
01:13:14,769 --> 01:13:18,023
Your hair! It's massive and wild,
and I love it.

1380
01:13:18,106 --> 01:13:19,107
Thanks.

1381
01:13:19,816 --> 01:13:22,068
Gran, your hair!

1382
01:13:22,152 --> 01:13:24,070
What? It's temporary.

1383
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:26,990
No! It's flying this way!

1384
01:13:31,661 --> 01:13:35,165
Wigasus has returned!

1385
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:36,374
Get off me.

1386
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:41,463
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1387
01:13:41,546 --> 01:13:42,839
Get to the point.

1388
01:13:42,922 --> 01:13:46,509
Punch monkeys. I hate punch monkeys.

1389
01:13:46,593 --> 01:13:50,972
Wigasus says the men
have been taken over yonder.

1390
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:54,726
Great. What's the plan?

1391
01:13:54,809 --> 01:13:57,604
What would the Thunder Sisters do?

1392
01:13:57,687 --> 01:14:00,774
Aw. All right, Thunder Sisters!

1393
01:14:00,857 --> 01:14:05,111
If we're gonna rescue these men,
there's something we're gonna need.

1394
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:06,321
- A window?
- No.

1395
01:14:06,404 --> 01:14:07,739
- A catchy chant?
- No!

1396
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:09,491
Each other.

1397
01:14:09,574 --> 01:14:10,950
"Each" what? No!

1398
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,828
New tribe names.

1399
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:16,581
Sandy, you shall be called "Seeker."

1400
01:14:16,664 --> 01:14:18,333
Eep, "Fire Heart."

1401
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:20,085
Ugga, "Blood Horn."

1402
01:14:20,168 --> 01:14:21,586
Thunk, you're...

1403
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,754
"Thunk."

1404
01:14:22,837 --> 01:14:24,923
Smart girl whose name I don't remember.

1405
01:14:25,006 --> 01:14:26,091
- I'm Dawn.
- No!

1406
01:14:26,174 --> 01:14:28,134
You are "Sister Sunset."

1407
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:30,929
And you are "Bog Water."

1408
01:14:31,012 --> 01:14:32,389
My name's "Bog Water"?

1409
01:14:32,472 --> 01:14:34,516
I thought of it before you had cool hair.

1410
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:38,520
I am Bog Water!

1411
01:14:38,603 --> 01:14:41,481
- Hey, Sister Sunset.
- Yeah, Fire Heart?

1412
01:14:41,564 --> 01:14:43,608
- You see those wolf spiders?
- Yeah.

1413
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:45,276
- Wanna ride them?
- Yeah!

1414
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,487
- Thunder Sisters.
- Thunder Sisters!

1415
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,948
- Thunder Sisters!
- Thunder Sister!

1416
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:57,247
Thunder Sisters!

1417
01:15:26,526 --> 01:15:28,028
Oh, it went in my mouth.

1418
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:47,714
Well,

1419
01:15:47,797 --> 01:15:49,549
I guess this is it.

1420
01:15:50,342 --> 01:15:53,678
Phil, I'm sorry I ate your bananas.

1421
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:58,516
I suppose perhaps
I have made mistakes too.

1422
01:15:59,726 --> 01:16:02,937
- Like weaponizing these monkeys?
- Well, yeah.

1423
01:16:03,021 --> 01:16:04,272
Or stealing their water?

1424
01:16:04,356 --> 01:16:05,523
Mmm.

1425
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:07,359
And teaching them to tie these knots?

1426
01:16:07,442 --> 01:16:09,277
Well, their knots were atrocious!

1427
01:16:12,947 --> 01:16:16,910
I just wish that I'd been able
to see Eep one more time.

1428
01:16:18,411 --> 01:16:22,123
I spent my whole life searching
for a place my parents wanted me to find,

1429
01:16:22,707 --> 01:16:24,417
and I found it.

1430
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:27,837
But now, all I can think about is Eep.

1431
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:30,048
My best friend...

1432
01:16:31,049 --> 01:16:33,885
my first and only love.

1433
01:16:35,261 --> 01:16:38,264
You know, your parents
loved you very much.

1434
01:16:38,348 --> 01:16:40,809
I think all they wanted for you was to...

1435
01:16:41,643 --> 01:16:42,977
find happiness.

1436
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:46,773
And if there's one thing I know,

1437
01:16:46,856 --> 01:16:50,360
it's that you and Eep
make each other happy.

1438
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:52,821
Guy,

1439
01:16:52,904 --> 01:16:57,659
there's no one I'd rather my daughter
spend her Tomorrow with than you.

1440
01:16:58,743 --> 01:17:02,831
Guy, I too give you permission
to start a home with Grug's daughter.

1441
01:17:02,914 --> 01:17:05,333
- That's not how it works.
- But it is appreciated.

1442
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:08,253
And you two twits are the closest thing
I have to fathers.

1443
01:17:08,336 --> 01:17:09,337
Thanks, son.

1444
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:11,631
We're not so different after all, Grug.

1445
01:17:11,715 --> 01:17:16,094
We're two profoundly foolish fathers
obsessed with bananas...

1446
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:20,932
...about to die
an incredibly ironic death.

1447
01:17:27,897 --> 01:17:29,441
Grug! What's going on?

1448
01:17:30,316 --> 01:17:32,277
I don't know! I can't see!

1449
01:17:41,911 --> 01:17:42,912
Ah!

1450
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:45,081
I can't look. What is it?

1451
01:17:45,165 --> 01:17:46,750
It's... It's...

1452
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:47,917
It's...

1453
01:17:49,961 --> 01:17:51,838
actually kind of cute.

1454
01:17:53,965 --> 01:17:57,135
