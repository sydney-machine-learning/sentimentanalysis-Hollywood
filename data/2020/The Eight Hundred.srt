00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,576
When I was 7 years old,

3
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,480
the elders and I withessed
the battle across the river.

4
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,600
It was crowded with people,
all looking at that building.

5
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,816
My father told me,

6
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,936
they are all heroes.

7
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,000
They are protecting us.

8
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,576
I didn't know
what happened at the time.

9
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,936
I only remember the
fermented rice balls tasted good.

10
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,777
Ever since then,

11
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:36,000
my father would visit
the warehouse every year

12
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,896
to light a candle

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,000
and leave a bowl
of fermented rice balls.

14
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,616
Now my father's gone,

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,360
I still go by myself.

16
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,856
I can never forget what he said,

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,520
the people inside
are protecting us, right?

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,336
Hurry up!

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,440
What are you waiting for?

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,136
Up ahead is Shanghai!

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,536
The city's fate
depends on you!

22
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,457
I'm telling you all now,

23
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:16,840
you are the faces of
the Hubei Security Corps.

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,680
Look lively!

25
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,120
Everyone move faster!

26
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,056
Ignore those who are falling behind.

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,696
Keep moving!

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
If you want to live!

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,256
Number 9,
honour the elders.

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,960
Number 10,
cherish your life.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,760
What does glass-half-full mean?

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,520
Zhou Yi said,

33
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,260
how much further to Shanghai?

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
Should be soon!

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,456
To be a good person,

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,800
one must persist in doing good.

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,280
Stop!

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Fall in!

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,016
Fall in!

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Quick!

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,440
Hurry!

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,320
Hurry up!

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
Come in tighter!

44
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,360
Hurry up!

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,216
Where are we?

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,600
Dachang.

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,200
What the hell is this...

48
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,360
No NRA (National Revolutionary Army) troops.
No military police.

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,040
Not even a single Japanese!

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,356
- Fight?
- Uncle.

51
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,396
What are we fighting?

52
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,896
- Brother is there.
- I'm afraid we're Killing the bandits.

53
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,336
What are we gonna do?

54
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,096
- Don't move!
- If I must say just two words.

55
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,200
Go back!

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,457
What?

57
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:47,696
Go back?

58
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,657
There isn't even a car here!

59
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:49,921
How are we supposed to go back?

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,376
Harvest is about to start.

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,120
Why don't you going back?

62
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,496
Donkey cart, horse
cart, train, doesn't matter.

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,576
A couple days and nights

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,800
and we'll be back home.

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,160
To all our fallen comrades!

66
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,056
Salute!

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,720
Fire!

68
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,200
Attention!

69
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,776
Pay attention!

70
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Who is over there?

71
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,520
There is a Chinese here!

72
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,120
Got a Chinese here!

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,777
Uncle!

74
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:27,056
Run!

75
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,496
Captain Fujita, don't let him go!

76
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,880
Japanese!

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,880
Run!

78
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,016
Don't just run around!

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,920
March the team!

80
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,200
Take cover!

81
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,600
Open fire!

82
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,560
Open fire!

83
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Duan Wu!

84
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,816
Duan Wu!

85
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Brother!

86
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,080
Don't just run around!

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Uncle!

88
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,000
Uncle!

89
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,480
Kill them all!

90
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,840
Shoot!

91
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,896
Next!

92
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,026
Orders from the senior official:

93
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,576
Deserters must be punished!

94
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,656
- Go!
- Mercy, Sir!

95
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,936
We're just scattered!

96
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,736
I'm begging you, please!

97
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,417
Ready!

98
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,840
- I still can fight!
- Shoot!

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,617
Don't kill me!

100
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:27,880
I don't want to die!

101
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,616
Next up!

102
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,096
The division commander's dead.

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,760
We can't find the colonel!

104
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,816
We don't have leader!

105
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,376
Please let me go!

106
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,256
I can still fight!

107
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Help me.

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,336
Uncle!

109
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,056
Help me.

110
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,736
He's from our hometown!

111
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,737
He's our fellow!

112
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:43,920
We can't save him.

113
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,880
Let's go!

114
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
Sorry.

115
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Sorry.

116
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,320
Sorry.

117
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,080
There are so many people.

118
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,576
Are they here to help?

119
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,040
You idiot!

120
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,496
Japanese are over there.

121
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,320
The NRA is retreating!

122
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,456
Uncle, let's go over there.

123
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,976
Tell the commander,

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,336
we just fell behind.

125
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,400
Fell behind?

126
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,736
More like deserters!

127
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,480
If they catch us we're dead!

128
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,217
Go!

129
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,440
Go! Go!

130
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,656
New troops!

131
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,056
Get in line!

132
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,520
And keep pace!

133
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,856
Keep up!

134
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,576
Brother.

135
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
You deserters.

136
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Hurry up!

137
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
Go.

138
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,560
Hurry up!

139
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,096
1st Battalion, Machine Gun Company,

140
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,360
Lei Xiong reporting for duty!

141
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,360
Open the door!

142
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,200
Brothers!

143
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,096
Now is the 26th year
of the Republic of China,

144
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,736
October the 26th,

145
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,680
10:07 in the evening.

146
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,056
The total of Shanghai's

147
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,996
remaining troops are all here.

148
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,136
Brothers!

149
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,360
Now that we are here,

150
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,680
we need to be prepared
and willing to die!

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,216
Each of us
mustn't rely on luck

152
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,057
or hang onto an ignoble
existence, understand?

153
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,120
Yes, sir!

154
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,400
Colonel is here!

155
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,080
Attention!

156
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,296
Reporting to Colonel Xie,

157
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,016
Machine Gun Company commander,
Lei Xiong, reporting in.

158
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,056
Seven wounded,

159
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,360
caught sixteen deserters along the way.

160
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,616
Return to your places.

161
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
Yes, sir!

162
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,080
Lights off!

163
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,136
Brothers,

164
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,856
there are hundreds of
thousands of Japanese troops out there,

165
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,616
there's no chance of
survival once we engage in battle.

166
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,920
It would be a miracle
if we could hold up for half a day.

167
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,000
The whole of Shanghai's eyes
will be on us tomorrow,

168
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,960
Sihang warehouse is our last stand.

169
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,936
This place will be our grave.

170
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,897
Let's get to work.

171
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:42,600
Keep building fortifications!

172
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
You come up here!

173
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,217
All of you

174
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:47,880
who are still breathing, get up!

175
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,536
Line up!

176
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,520
Declare your unit number!

177
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,696
Declare my ass.

178
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,296
Using me as a scapegoat.

179
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,640
Pussy.

180
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,160
Say that again?

181
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Get up!

182
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,280
I can't.

183
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
So what?

184
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,840
Get up!

185
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,216
Either shoot us in the head,

186
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
or let us go.

187
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,416
Don't move!

188
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,920
Let go!

189
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Let go!

190
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,216
Squad 7!

191
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,977
Here!

192
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,736
Take these worthless deserters out.

193
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,576
Execute them!

194
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,240
Yes, sir!

195
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Zhu!

196
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,176
Take these deserters out,

197
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,640
have them repair the fortifications.

198
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,280
Line up!

199
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Sir,

200
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,656
we aren't deserters,

201
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
we were scattered.

202
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,896
The Huangpi County HQ sent us

203
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,280
to protect Shanghai.

204
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,280
Kid, come up here.

205
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,976
Come up here.

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That's an order!

207
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,760
First, work on protecting yourself.

208
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,376
Steady the landmine!

209
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,536
Don't bury it!

210
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,656
Place the flag!

211
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,776
Mark the landmines!

212
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,976
When it's over,

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
they will kill us all.

214
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,056
Be careful!

215
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,376
There's a situation!

216
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,337
Sergeant Jiangjing,

217
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:15,600
situation on the North side!

218
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,816
Get down!

219
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Quickly get down!

220
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,937
On guard!

221
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:20,040
Halt the landmines!

222
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,336
Someone here!

223
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,096
Alert!

224
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,776
Take cover!

225
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,657
Attention!

226
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:25,776
Search the boundaries!

227
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,280
Form defensive positions!

228
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,696
No need to aim, these are refugees.

229
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,617
No need to aim!

230
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:54,136
These are refugees!

231
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,880
Don't let citizens enter the mine zone!

232
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,080
Past the Lese Bridge are
the international concessions.

233
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Watch out for the landmines!

234
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,320
Take a right ahead to the Lese Bridge.

235
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,720
Watch out for landmines.

236
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,136
Grab Xiao Hubei and follow me.

237
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,880
Uncle, Uncle!

238
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,600
Past the Lese Bridge are
the international concessions.

239
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,576
Get to work!

240
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,856
Go on!

241
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,920
Watch out for landmines!

242
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,480
Lese Bridge is ahead and to the right.

243
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,480
Past the Lese Bridge are
the international concessions.

244
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,296
Please wait for your turn
to get into the concessions.

245
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,136
Chinese Nationals turn to your left.

246
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,216
Please state your name,
your occupation,

247
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,376
and show your legal documents.

248
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,457
Out the way, move!

249
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:47,056
Leave your large luggage out.

250
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,360
Only small belongings are allowed.

251
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,696
That soldier!

252
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Come here!

253
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,720
Soldiers are not
allowed to get in here!

254
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,136
I'm just a farmer.

255
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,656
You are in military uniform,

256
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,480
soldiers are not allowed
into the concession!

257
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,856
Hey! Do not let them in!

258
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,120
Do not push!

259
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,600
Keep calm.

260
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,776
OK, next.

261
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,697
Girl, what's your name?

262
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,240
My name is Summer.

263
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Old man.

264
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,200
We can't allow soldiers to get in.

265
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,376
We are all Chinese,

266
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,377
please just let me in.

267
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,536
Here is the concession,

268
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,600
this bridge is the only way in.

269
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,376
If one soldier gets in,

270
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,816
then the Japanese
will be able to get in too.

271
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,176
If the Japanese get in,

272
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,360
we're done for.

273
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,736
Get out!

274
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,800
Open the door!

275
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,600
Stop sitting around!

276
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,560
Take the supplies to the fourth floor.

277
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,840
Faster!

278
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,520
Move all the gunny sacks over here.

279
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,137
What are you doing?

280
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:51,360
Quick! Follow up!

281
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,976
Move faster!

282
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,216
The ones behind!

283
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,400
Follow up!

284
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,360
What's the hold up?

285
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Sounds like an angel.

286
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,656
What's she singing?

287
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,800
I don't know.

288
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,856
Stop staring!

289
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Get back to work.

290
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,600
Line up!

291
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
You two!

292
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,240
Head over there now.

293
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,200
Colonel wants to see you.

294
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,456
Colonel!

295
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,640
How do you like this one?

296
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,656
Name?

297
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,577
Age?

298
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:39,896
They call me Xiao Hubei.

299
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,776
I'm 13.

300
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,776
My family name is Zhu.

301
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,737
My great grandpa told me,

302
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:45,441
we are the eighteenth-generation
descendants of the Hong Wu Emperor.

303
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,560
Then do you know
how the Ming Dynasty collapsed?

304
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,520
Take him under your wing.

305
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,580
When I'm dead,
you take my place.

306
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,040
That side is so pretty.

307
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,840
That side is the concession.

308
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,240
Over there is heaven...

309
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,200
Then here is hell.

310
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,360
This used to be the
warehouse for four banks.

311
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,336
The walls are more than a meter thick,

312
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,880
even cannons can't get through it.

313
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,296
It's more solid than
the gates of General Zhang's house.

314
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,016
You served General Zhang?

315
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,856
Yan and Feng,

316
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,496
- I served them all!
- It's very accurate,

317
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,256
this is my lifeblood.

318
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,960
Could you please give it back to me?

319
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,776
When the bullets fly,

320
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,760
I can tell where they
fell with my eyes closed!

321
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,160
It's inherited.

322
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,680
Please give it back.

323
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,640
One division after another,

324
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,400
all gone in half an hour.

325
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,400
A white horse!

326
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,840
Don't move.

327
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,097
Why is the horse out?

328
00:16:58,121 --> 00:16:59,280
The horse is spooked!

329
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,440
Don't shoot!

330
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,800
Lower your gun!

331
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,760
Don't move! Stand still!

332
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,320
Come here.

333
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,120
Don't be scared.

334
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,800
Don't move!

335
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,200
Come and get your hot dog!

336
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,320
There's more people coming every day.

337
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,760
Hot dogs!

338
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,040
Get your hot dog.

339
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,336
More people are arriving from the North.

340
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,776
How are they all going to fit in here?

341
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,016
I used to sleep like a baby,

342
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,536
I couldn't fell asleep last night.

343
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,497
Isn't that weird?

344
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:22,856
No way!
The shelling has already stopped.

345
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,216
I heard they retreated.

346
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,520
If everyone retreated,
then we'd all be safe!

347
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,216
The Japs won't reach us here.

348
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,640
It's good enough to
just keep the business running.

349
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,616
No need to fight over it!

350
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,120
Just get in line and wait your turn.

351
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,656
The senior officials asked us,

352
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,736
the Youth Military Field Service,

353
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,216
to distribute emergency supplies.

354
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,656
Everyone has one portion!

355
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,080
Everyone has a share.

356
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,520
Don't fight. Keep in order.

357
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,096
Victory!

358
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,416
You, as a real man,

359
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,296
doing nothing but watching everyday.

360
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,920
What does it have to do with you anyway?

361
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,696
If you dare, why don't you
get enlisted to fight the Japanese?

362
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,216
You wouldn't dare.

363
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,056
We can't afford groceries,

364
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,816
can't afford to eat.

365
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,680
You don't care about the kids either.

366
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,200
Do you even want this family?

367
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,056
Gunshots!

368
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,776
Enemies!

369
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,697
Take cover now!

370
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:30,616
Groups of three! Prepare to battle!

371
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,056
Hasaba Squadron, get in formation!

372
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,296
Mama, how come they're fighting again?

373
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,840
Didn't the National Army retreat?

374
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,656
I'm telling you,

375
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,416
the British military
is protecting our area.

376
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,360
The Japanese won't break in.

377
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,600
They already retreated.
Why provoke them again?

378
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,696
Everyone who wanted to flee has fled.
What's the point in fighting?

379
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,856
If the Japanese keep advancing

380
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,176
we'll be at risk here.

381
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,216
All the Brits will stay here, right?

382
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,216
What about your house on Xiafei Road?

383
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,480
The French will never let
the Japanese in.

384
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,897
Of course not!

385
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:26,400
It's the French Concession.

386
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,080
Here you go.

387
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,200
Doesn't Professor Zhang
have any classes today?

388
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,000
He's just watching over all day long.

389
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,800
Danjiang University has closed
due to the War.

390
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,416
Anyway, without his salary,

391
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,960
how are we supposed to get by?

392
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,240
Quick!

393
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,320
Converge!

394
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,280
Fast!

395
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,520
Fast!

396
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,440
Converge!

397
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,600
Landmines!

398
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,216
Take cover!

399
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,680
Help the injured!

400
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Get away!

401
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,840
You're making me feel anxious.

402
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,720
Stop running around!

403
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Don't move!

404
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,920
Scouts, go ahead and check it out!

405
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,560
Spread out and move forward!

406
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,640
Move forward!

407
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,976
All the soldiers have run off,

408
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,920
just left us here!

409
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,496
Open the door!

410
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,497
Pull him back here, pull him back here!

411
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:46,536
Don't get us all killed!

412
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,560
Pull him back here!

413
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,296
Don't hold me!

414
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,057
I'm going out!

415
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:52,096
Don't drag us down with
you if you want to die!

416
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,640
All clear!

417
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,560
Just a few deserters!

418
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,280
Charge!

419
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,336
We're trapped!

420
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,016
Fight back!

421
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,017
Cut the rope!

422
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,456
There's an ambush!

423
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,816
Keep calm!

424
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,896
Fight!

425
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,496
Take control!

426
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,137
What's happening?

427
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:25,856
Haven't the Chinese soldiers retreated?

428
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,416
That doesn't look good at all.

429
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,240
We should be safe on this side.

430
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,936
Those stupid Chinese!

431
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,296
Be careful! The flour might explode!

432
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,696
Hold steady!

433
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,376
Do not mind the targets!

434
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,560
Keep on shooting!

435
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,520
No retreat!

436
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,976
Second floor!

437
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,456
Watch out the second floor!

438
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,920
Go to hell!

439
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,440
Get everyone out here!

440
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,976
Everyone!

441
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Come out!

442
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,216
Hurry up!

443
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
Move fast!

444
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,976
Clean up the battlefield!

445
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,736
Half of you follow him,
the rest come with me!

446
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,200
If you see any Japanese, shoot them!

447
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,976
Out of the way!

448
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,896
Japanese!

449
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,440
- Stop!
- Out of the way!

450
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,080
The Japanese is coming!

451
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Hurry up!

452
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,960
Don't miss a single one!

453
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,240
Kill the survivors!

454
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,840
Clean up the battlefield!

455
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,920
Collect weapons and gear!

456
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,680
Reinforce the fortifications!

457
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,800
Be prepared for attack at any time!

458
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Hurry up!

459
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,696
Hurry!

460
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Hurry up!

461
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,960
Move faster!

462
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,080
Long live the Mikado!

463
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Alert!

464
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,680
Keep clearing the field!

465
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,920
What are you doing?

466
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
You want to die?

467
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,696
Sergeant Zhu!

468
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,697
Sergeant Zhu come here!

469
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:19,000
Come take a look!

470
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,600
Gas bomb! Fire!

471
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,400
Gas bombs!

472
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,360
Toxic gas!

473
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,656
They used it before in Luodian!

474
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,657
Brothers!

475
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,640
Put on your gas masks!

476
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,440
Spread out!

477
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,136
Much appreciated! Give me some!

478
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,600
I don't have urine now, I can't pee.

479
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,640
What are you waiting for?

480
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,176
Pee on a towel, then
cover your mouth with it!

481
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,560
It won't come out.

482
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,136
Ture on the exhaust fan!

483
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,480
Dispel toxic gas!

484
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,320
Turn on the exhaust fan!

485
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,160
Dispel toxic gas!

486
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,536
Is this gas toxic?

487
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,160
I don't know. Don't frighten me.

488
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,816
Everybody, listen up!

489
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,816
The Japs used the same
weapon in North China.

490
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,736
It's toxic. Evacuate now!

491
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,240
Evacuate!

492
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,680
Mustard Gas.

493
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Don't shut the door!

494
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Let me in!

495
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,040
What are you doing? Drop the money!

496
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,776
Close the door!

497
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,120
Beat anyone who tries to get in!

498
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Let's go!

499
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,520
Nobody run!

500
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,720
What's scary about the Japs?

501
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,440
We are the greatest country!

502
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,016
With 400 million compatriots!

503
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,400
A mouthful of spit from
each of us could drown them!

504
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,296
You stupid scholar.

505
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,936
What's wrong?

506
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
They released toxic gas!

507
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Open the door!

508
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,176
Let us in!

509
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,320
Open the door!

510
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
Open the door!

511
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,496
Don't panic!

512
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Don't run!

513
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,856
Get the injured to the exit!

514
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Hurry up!

515
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Move!

516
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,200
Pay respects to the martyr!

517
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,216
Get out here.

518
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,320
At ease.

519
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,776
Mr. Fang.

520
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,240
We need to swap to another car.

521
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,400
2nd Division, check your weapons!

522
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,456
Stab!

523
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
Kill!

524
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,216
Stab!

525
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Kill!

526
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,056
Stab!

527
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Kill!

528
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,640
Faster!

529
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,760
Keep pace!

530
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,256
Sihang Warehouse used to be

531
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,680
the headquarter
of the NRA's 88th Division.

532
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,960
It stores thousands of packs of food

533
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,096
along with supplies like
cowhides, silk and tung oil.

534
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,096
There are huge quantities of
medical supplies and ammunition.

535
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,480
Mr. Fang is here.

536
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,417
Come in!

537
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,656
The 524th Regiment of 88th Division

538
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,160
is defending the warehouse now.

539
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,240
The 88th Division?

540
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,000
The so-called Hateful Zhabei Division.

541
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Yes.

542
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,416
The division is equipped
with German weapons.

543
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,377
Please go on.

544
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:49,880
For three months,

545
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,696
the 524th Regiment increased troop
strength on five occasions.

546
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,856
Supplementary troops sourced

547
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,936
mainly from Hubei, Hunan,
and Zhejiang Security Corps.

548
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,256
Currently there's no
accurate information on

549
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,560
the number of men and their weapons.

550
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,920
Thank you for your hard work.

551
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,880
Please come with me for your reward.

552
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,440
We should go now.

553
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,960
We'll be on our way.

554
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,736
Get Kyohko Hasegawa's squad
ready for an onslaught.

555
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,160
Quickly take down the enemy.

556
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,920
Yes, sir!

557
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,617
Commander Lei!

558
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:33,936
The fifth and sixth floors are on fire!

559
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,897
Put out the fire immediately!

560
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:35,976
Restore the fortifications!

561
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,056
Send the injured to the East building!

562
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,736
Yes, sir!

563
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,576
2nd Platoon,

564
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,680
come and push out the fire!

565
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,880
Be careful! The horse is running again!

566
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,200
- Be careful!
- The horse is off again!

567
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,016
Commander Lei!

568
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,120
This one is still breathing!

569
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,200
Leave a few of them alive!

570
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Yes, sir!

571
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
Horse!

572
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,936
There's a horse!

573
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
Look! There's a horse!

574
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
There's a horse!

575
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,057
Have nothing better to do?

576
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,720
You'll attract bullets over here.

577
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,336
A scene like this,

578
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,800
is just like a show.

579
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,640
Watch your mouth.

580
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,120
I mean we are all worried.

581
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Chinese troops!

582
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,097
Commander!

583
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:47,240
Look at that!

584
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,080
What's happening to these soldiers,

585
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,480
is what's coming to you all!

586
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,440
Chinese troops, surrender your weapons.

587
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
Otherwise,

588
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,320
you will be just like them!

589
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,080
- Dismembered!
- It's Jiangjing's squad.

590
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,296
It's our periphery defence troops!

591
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,560
Aim at the Japs, shoot!

592
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
What's happening to these soldiers

593
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,280
is what's coming to you all!

594
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,480
Chinese troops, surrender your weapons.

595
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Otherwise,

596
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,496
you will be just like them,

597
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,960
dismembered, piece by piece.

598
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,480
Duan Wu!

599
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,720
Look after Xiao Hubei!

600
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Survive!

601
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,440
And bring him home!

602
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,120
As a NRA soldier,

603
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,696
those unwilling to die
on the battlefield should be punished.

604
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,680
Japs are killing our brothers.

605
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,600
I'm giving you all one last chance.

606
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,000
Attention!

607
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,017
Kill me now!

608
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,616
Brother, I'm from the 1st Battalion
of the Zhejiang Security Corps,

609
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,816
Advisor for Internal Affairs.

610
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,160
You can call me the 'Old Abacus'.

611
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,080
It is my obligation to serve my country,

612
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,856
but my job is just to do the accounts.

613
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,360
I don't know how to use this thing.

614
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,816
So commander, don't force me to...

615
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,320
Force my ass!

616
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,817
Do it!

617
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:01,920
I don't know how to kill.

618
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,056
He knows!

619
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,697
He used to serve General Zhang.

620
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:04,816
Don't bullshit me!

621
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,616
I said, you!

622
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,536
Come and kill me!

623
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,457
Come on!

624
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:08,616
The Zhejiang Security Corps
are all dead.

625
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,560
Only you bastard left
bringing shame to them all.

626
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,960
- One!
- Fire!

627
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,680
You dare to shoot me?

628
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
You dare to shoot me?

629
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,840
Two!

630
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Sorry.

631
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,640
You useless ragtag soldiers,

632
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,340
are the reason
the Japs are winning.

633
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,856
If you chicken out again...

634
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,960
No punishment is too harsh!

635
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,560
I heard you served General Zhang?

636
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,960
Yes, sir!

637
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
Then you're up next!

638
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,680
The toxic gas burnt my eyes,

639
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,056
I can't see very well.

640
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,360
You can't see very well?

641
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,416
When they were killing
your brothers and raping your sisters,

642
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,776
did you see then?

643
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,697
Those who cling to life
and are afraid of death,

644
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:41,800
deserve to be slaughtered!

645
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Shoot!

646
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,336
Bastard! Where are you shooting at?
Can you aim?

647
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
You fucking pussy!

648
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,400
Where are you shooting at?

649
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,280
On your knees!

650
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,200
I'm artillery!

651
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,000
On your knees!

652
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,280
Put the gun down.

653
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,000
Long live the Mikado!

654
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Next!

655
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Don't chicken out!

656
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Shoot him!

657
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
I don't want to kill.

658
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
You don't want to kill?

659
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,800
I don't want to kill people, let me go!

660
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,880
- I don't want to kill!
- Hold your gun!

661
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
One!

662
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Two!

663
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,816
Help me!

664
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,856
Pull the trigger.

665
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,520
No!

666
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,496
Pull the trigger.

667
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,176
No!

668
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Help me.

669
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,416
Pull the trigger! Pull the damn trigger!

670
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,720
He killed your uncle.

671
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,480
Your cousin isn't here.

672
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,920
Just head back now.

673
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,480
Just a second, sir.

674
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,600
I need to see him today.

675
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,576
Once you get over it,

676
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,760
you won't be afraid again.

677
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
How old are you?

678
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,400
Why do we have to keep
fighting back and forth?

679
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,240
My uncle, my brother, and I,

680
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,520
we are just farmers.

681
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,320
Where are we?

682
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
Kiddo?

683
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
Sir,

684
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,320
I studied at a private
school back in my hometown,

685
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,800
I've never been out of the county.

686
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,760
I just wanted to see
what Shanghai was like.

687
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
I didn't realize...

688
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,400
I thought we are just here
to clean up the battlefield.

689
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,576
My mom is waiting for me at home.

690
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,520
Please let me go.

691
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Xiao Hubei.

692
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
Commander Yang.

693
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,896
- Commander Shangguan is here.
- Come down here.

694
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,016
Shangguan Zhibiao and
surgeon Tang Pinxin are here to report.

695
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,120
Tell us about the outside.

696
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,496
From Shanghai Rowe Restaurant,

697
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,776
all the foreigners eat this.

698
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,697
They say if you eat this

699
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:46,960
you will grow up faster.

700
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Why don't you eat?

701
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,200
It's for kids.

702
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,336
Eat it.

703
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
Eat up.

704
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,600
Brother Qiyue,

705
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,920
can you tell me

706
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,496
why does the horse obey you?

707
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,696
I don't know,

708
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,497
But since I was a kid,

709
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:05,296
I herded a big flock of sheep by myself.

710
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,360
They all follow my orders.

711
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,257
Kiddo!

712
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:12,280
Don't play with fire!
That's a gas tank, it can explode!

713
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,856
Don't let the British soldier find us.

714
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Quick!

715
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,416
Where are you going?

716
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,760
I'm going for a scout.

717
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,520
Go.

718
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,360
Let's go together.

719
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,737
Climb faster.

720
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:16,576
Each Squad, keep up!

721
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,960
Keep up!

722
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Climb faster!

723
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,800
Xiao Hubei!

724
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,576
Run!

725
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,936
Captain, we're exposed!

726
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,240
Run!

727
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,800
Xiao Hubei!

728
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,320
What are you doing there?

729
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,600
Japanese!

730
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,360
Japanese!

731
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,616
Quickly enter the warehouse!

732
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,120
Advance!

733
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,856
The Japanese are here!

734
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,296
The Japanese crossed the boundary!

735
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,840
They crossed the boundary!

736
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,000
The Japanese crossed the boundary!

737
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,656
The Japanese crossed the boundary!

738
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,960
The Japanese are here!

739
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,240
Everybody!

740
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,536
The Japanese are here!

741
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
They climbed up!

742
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,680
Lights on!

743
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,640
Aim it at the warehouse!

744
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,016
The Japanese have broken in!
Get your guns!

745
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,856
Quick!

746
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Get your gun!

747
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,536
Cut down their ladders!

748
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,520
Load your weapons!

749
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,200
Secure the doors and windows!

750
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,160
Secure the doors and windows!

751
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
Charge!

752
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,840
Go to hell!

753
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,937
Third floor!

754
00:40:47,961 --> 00:40:49,296
The Japs are coming
in from the third floor!

755
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Take this!

756
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,760
Get to the third floor!

757
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,280
Follow me!

758
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Go!

759
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,040
Get to the third floor!

760
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,520
Everyone to the third floor!

761
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,280
Prepare to fight!

762
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,936
Get out!

763
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,777
I'm begging you, please!

764
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:10,720
Please!

765
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,016
Get out!

766
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Please, brother, please!

767
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,177
Get out!

768
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:15,216
Please! I'm scared!

769
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,856
Please!

770
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,880
Pussy.

771
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Nobody retreats!

772
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,320
Strike!

773
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,600
Move forward!

774
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,600
Concentrate fire!

775
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,080
Throw them out of the windows!

776
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,240
Aim and shoot!

777
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,280
Lights on!

778
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,136
Don't let anyone get close to the banks!

779
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,080
Get to your post! Secure the streets!

780
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,056
Die!

781
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,440
Go to hell!

782
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,200
Clear the battlefield
and check each floor.

783
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,296
See if there's anyone still breathing.

784
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,600
Kill them all.

785
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Two more people here!

786
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,816
Collect weapons and equipment.

787
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,160
Throw out the bodies.

788
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,200
Medic!

789
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:39,977
Look!

790
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:41,640
The Colonel Xie is on the roof!

791
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,440
The Japanese have been thrown down.

792
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,040
What a fight!

793
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,760
You guys are heroes!

794
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,720
Good one, boys!

795
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,840
You are heroes!

796
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,256
No Chinese soldiers
are crossing this river!

797
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,776
Or I will shoot you!

798
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,960
Last warning! Turn back, now!

799
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,920
Let's go!

800
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,080
Good job!

801
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
Let's go!

802
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,656
The uncles on the other
side are protecting us.

803
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,080
Aren't they great?

804
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,640
After a thorough scout,

805
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,496
we discovered the Japanese's
attempting a stealth attack.

806
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,040
I... We...

807
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,040
Were able to save our brothers
from danger.

808
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,080
He said he's going on a scout.

809
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,880
For what?

810
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,480
Where's the Sichuan soldier?

811
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,240
He...

812
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,896
It's breach to go out of the warehouse.

813
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,280
You don't deserve to be a soldier!

814
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,376
Hundreds of thousands
of the Dongbei troop soldiers

815
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,176
were scared off by 20
thousand of Japanese.

816
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,360
You guys are still deserting?

817
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
This is Shanghai.

818
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,120
Nanjing is next.

819
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,760
If our troops fled

820
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,976
we let the Japanese take over Shanghai,

821
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,600
then let the Japanese take over Nanjing?

822
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,240
We've strengthened the sandbag wall.

823
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,560
Block up the waterway.

824
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,816
Close the gate.

825
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,617
Yes, sir!

826
00:44:40,641 --> 00:44:42,176
Fortifications on the north side
were destroyed by the Japanese,

827
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,600
we're fixing it as we speak.

828
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,560
Officer,

829
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,680
the 5th Squad Sergeant
from the 2nd Platoon just got killed.

830
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,416
Their snipers are too sharp,

831
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,960
we should wait until late night.

832
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,776
You let the cadres
repair the fortifications?

833
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,976
Where are those deserters?

834
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yes, sir!

835
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,097
Check the gear.

836
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:58,280
Get the sandbags in place.

837
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,320
Repair the damaged fortifications.

838
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,656
Come out!

839
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,680
Don't move!

840
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,000
Come out!

841
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,040
We are students!

842
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,696
We're here to join the army.

843
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,080
They came in through the waterway.

844
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,696
Watch over them.

845
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,400
They are more valuable than us.

846
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,856
Get down there
and fix the fortification.

847
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,920
We need to keep
the frontline defence strong.

848
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,560
Keep your head down
when you are out there.

849
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,560
Come back the same once
you're finished.

850
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,120
Don't come back,

851
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,920
until the job is done.

852
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,320
Strengthen fortifications!

853
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,440
The Imperial Army

854
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,736
is maintaining

855
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,640
the maximum restraint.

856
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,576
If

857
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,520
Chinese troops drop their weapons,

858
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,576
the Japanese army

859
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,600
will give the most
dignifiable treatment to them.

860
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,600
The Imperial Army
is maintaining

861
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,480
the maximum restraint.

862
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,680
If Chinese troops
drop their weapons...

863
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,176
Too dangerous.

864
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,976
It's too close to the Japanese.

865
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,456
They all aim well.

866
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,400
When we were defending
the Yunzaobang last month,

867
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,560
all those killed
were shot right here.

868
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,496
Two of us should go out,

869
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,200
finish the job cautiously.

870
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,040
Leave the kid out of it.

871
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,200
One of you two follow me.

872
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,560
How about this,

873
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,616
let's follow the NRA tradition.

874
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,000
We draw lots.

875
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,960
Whoever gets the letter side goes out.

876
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,920
You go first.

877
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,120
You should go.

878
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,016
You agreed earlier!

879
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,977
You said...

880
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:28,080
You...

881
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,000
Newspaper!

882
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,120
Hasegawa's Team, 6th Infantry,

883
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,296
Shanghai Special Marine Corps assembled!

884
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,016
Eyes right!

885
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,320
Eyes front!

886
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,600
Port arms! Salute!

887
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,536
The Japanese will capture
Sihang Warehouse in 3 hours!

888
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,176
Newspaper!

889
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,896
Go away!

890
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,920
Newspaper!

891
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,656
The Japanese will
capture Sihang in 3 hours!

892
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,720
One for me!

893
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,600
Sir!

894
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,737
Newspapers!

895
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:23,176
Imported binoculars!

896
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,576
Binoculars will make it far more vivid!

897
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,736
3 to 1 the Japanese win!

898
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,896
Don't miss it! One o'clock start!

899
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,496
New street drama!

900
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,816
Put down your whip!

901
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,296
Come and watch the show!

902
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,736
Free of charge! Free of charge!

903
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,040
I beg you!

904
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,416
I'm begging you, let him go!

905
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,920
He wants to hit you,
and you still plead for him!

906
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,336
Newspaper! Newspaper!

907
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,640
The Japanese will
capture Sihang Warehouse in 3 hours!

908
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,256
Support the war effort!

909
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,640
Donate money and food!

910
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,177
Make room!

911
00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:58,601
Chairman is here! Chairman is here!

912
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,600
The Chairman!

913
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,720
Chairman is here!

914
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,680
You peasant!

915
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,520
Get off our patch you scroungers!

916
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,880
Miss Lu is here!

917
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,577
Miss Lu!

918
00:51:13,601 --> 00:51:14,696
You're so pretty in real life!

919
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,160
I like your films a lot!

920
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,280
Step aside, excuse me,
keep your distance.

921
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,080
Sister Rong!

922
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,560
The Japanese are about to attack!

923
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,736
They say in just 3 hours,

924
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,120
they will take over the warehouse.

925
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,560
Just now,

926
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,896
I saw the foreigner's monster

927
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,136
flying thing in the sky

928
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,057
and the Japanese ship

929
00:51:35,081 --> 00:51:36,320
on the river.

930
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,160
Seems like war is falling upon us.

931
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,440
Sister,

932
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,780
it seems the casino
won't last much longer.

933
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,136
I think you'd better
consider your options.

934
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,206
You don't need to worry
about these things.

935
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,200
Just take care of my casino.

936
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,200
Don't do anything stupid.

937
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,200
Don't worry.

938
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,416
It's just a little water leak!

939
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,096
Were they killed by the Japanese?

940
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:06,816
They use water like it's free!

941
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,657
Quit whining!

942
00:52:07,681 --> 00:52:08,976
You think you're the Empress' daughter?
You just get everything you want?

943
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,560
The Japanese are about to attack.

944
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,736
- So annoying.
- What are the Japanese to do with me?

945
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,096
And you just leave it like this!

946
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,400
So much whining.

947
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,536
The military observers are all here?

948
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,640
Yes, Mr. He (Xiangning).

949
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,456
Boting (Chief of Staff).

950
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,080
How long can our men last?

951
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,576
3rd Squad and 4th Squad...

952
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,217
Grenade!

953
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:09,720
Aim and fire!

954
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,040
Something is wrong.

955
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,496
You take over the 2nd floor!

956
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,160
Stay close!

957
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,440
Go!

958
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,136
Enemy fire is too strong!

959
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,296
We need support on the second floor!

960
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,896
You guys come with me
to the second floor!

961
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,040
Yes, sir! Let's go!

962
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,560
Watch your left!

963
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,760
Colonel Xie!

964
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,160
There're too many of them
approaching the building!

965
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,600
Cover each other and flank attack!

966
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,176
They are targeting the West Wall,

967
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,256
inform Commander Yang!

968
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,456
Arrange the West Wall
firing points immediately!

969
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,480
Yes, sir!

970
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,880
Get the deserters out to fight!

971
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,216
Take this and follow me!

972
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,177
Don't get lost.

973
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:53,240
Let's go.

974
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,920
You, get up!

975
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,217
Take this!

976
00:53:56,241 --> 00:53:57,336
Go! Go!

977
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:57,977
Take this!

978
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,760
Look what time it is, get up!

979
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,576
Pussy...

980
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,416
Everyone!

981
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,440
Join the fight!

982
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,297
Don't chicken out!

983
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:06,080
Need me to stuff you in a sack again?

984
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,776
Quick!

985
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,800
Go!

986
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,480
Gun! Take it!

987
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,240
Lei Xiong!

988
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,416
Come smash this wall!

989
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,416
Move quick!

990
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,176
Lei Xiong!

991
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,000
Smash it quickly!

992
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,120
Lei Xiong!

993
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,736
Colonel's order to
strengthen West Wall firing spots.

994
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,376
Understood!

995
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,177
Move faster!

996
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:25,001
I'll shoot you if you
don't bust it open now!

997
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,336
We need support on the third floor!

998
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,096
Break this wall! Quick!

999
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,976
What are you doing?

1000
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,776
Qiyue Brother,

1001
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,800
there's a strange car.

1002
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,120
Are you tired of living?
Get out of the way!

1003
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,016
Mind the grenade!

1004
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,040
Keep low!

1005
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,840
Sergeant!

1006
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,256
Grenades won't work!

1007
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,320
We have to use explosives.

1008
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,536
Their defence is too strong!

1009
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,120
Grenades are bouncing off!

1010
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,200
Let's go!

1011
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,056
Go!

1012
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,080
To the horse stable!

1013
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,896
They are ramming the building.

1014
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,640
We must eliminate them
as soon as possible!

1015
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,400
Here.

1016
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,160
Get down Commander!

1017
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,560
Get down!

1018
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,216
Xiao Hubei, Xiao Hubei!
Are you okay?

1019
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,176
- Move!
- Brother!

1020
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,200
Be careful!

1021
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,480
Brother!

1022
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,320
Restock ammunition immediately!

1023
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,720
Japanese are attacking!

1024
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,880
Faster!

1025
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,377
Sergeant!

1026
00:55:52,401 --> 00:55:54,880
Fucking Japanese fired cannons!

1027
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,896
Medic!

1028
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,936
Quick!

1029
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,056
You bastards!

1030
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,200
Who told you to use cannons?

1031
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,440
Shut up!

1032
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,160
The Japanese have broken through!

1033
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,120
My leg!

1034
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,160
Go upstairs!

1035
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,040
Grenade!

1036
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,280
Mind the grenade!

1037
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,416
Raise your rifle!

1038
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,000
Suppress the enemy fire!

1039
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,617
What are you doing?

1040
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:37,456
Let me go! I'm not fighting the war!

1041
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,256
I'm going home!

1042
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:38,897
Go!

1043
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:40,320
We were supposed to fight!

1044
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,416
You guys go!

1045
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,440
Go around!

1046
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,336
Look out for enemy fire!

1047
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,760
Continue attack!

1048
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,240
Go die!

1049
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,720
1st Platoon, quickly
occupy the second floor!

1050
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,240
Chinese!

1051
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,376
Quick, move the injured!

1052
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,640
Medic!

1053
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,857
Tourniquet!

1054
00:57:18,881 --> 00:57:20,256
Are there more bandages?

1055
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,440
Defend the window!

1056
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,520
Move!

1057
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,960
Go! Let's go!

1058
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,656
Move!

1059
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,696
Go to the East Building!

1060
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,000
It's safe there!

1061
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,800
Spread out!

1062
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,856
Brother, help me.

1063
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,160
Fill in the defending position.

1064
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,440
Help me.

1065
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,656
Brother, save me.

1066
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,960
Take up the defence position for me.

1067
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,000
They are coming up!

1068
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,520
I don't want to die...

1069
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,896
They've got the window!

1070
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,920
Help!

1071
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,920
Aqiu, go!

1072
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,320
Hurry!

1073
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,016
- Come here!
- Grenade!

1074
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,080
Shoot!

1075
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,800
Aqiu!

1076
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,480
I'm not fighting anymore!
I don't want to die!

1077
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,056
2nd Platoon, forward!

1078
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,560
Forward!

1079
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,480
Go back!

1080
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,256
Defend the window!

1081
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,280
Shoot!

1082
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,776
Move the injured!

1083
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,800
Quick!

1084
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,440
2nd Platoon, get the ladder!

1085
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,080
Keep up the attack!

1086
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,696
No retreat!

1087
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,840
Attack!

1088
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,200
Xiao Hubei!

1089
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,400
Get down!

1090
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,136
What are you thinking!

1091
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,440
You want to get yourself killed?

1092
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,160
Horse, The horse!

1093
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,040
Halt! Grenades!

1094
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,177
Forward!

1095
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:30,480
No retreat!

1096
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,896
Halt! Watch out for grenades!

1097
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,320
Ask the 3rd and 4th Squads
come support on the West side!

1098
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,640
Mind the grenade!

1099
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,080
Mirror!

1100
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,576
Mirror!

1101
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,240
Mirror! Fast!

1102
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,960
Be quick!

1103
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,160
Be quick!

1104
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,536
Hold it up!

1105
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,360
Cover them! Cover them!

1106
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,200
Quick!

1107
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,320
Hurry up!

1108
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,120
Sappers!

1109
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,600
Hold shield formation!

1110
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,856
Cover the shield formation!

1111
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,800
Grenades won't work.

1112
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,320
Dig faster!

1113
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,617
Sergeant!

1114
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:26,816
The steel plates are too thick.

1115
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,480
Our weapons can't break through!

1116
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,336
They are going to detonate the building.

1117
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,480
We're all done if the building explodes!

1118
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,120
Give this to my mother!

1119
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,936
Chen Shusheng!

1120
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,536
Japanese are down there!

1121
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,256
Concentrate fire on the target!

1122
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,280
Quick!

1123
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,960
Explosives in!

1124
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,360
Chen Shusheng!

1125
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,657
Retreat!

1126
01:02:21,681 --> 01:02:23,256
2nd Squadron, retreat temporarily!

1127
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,080
3nd Platoon, flank on the left!

1128
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,800
Fire!

1129
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,256
Reset and ready to attack!
Be careful of suicide attacks!

1130
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,296
Shield formation!

1131
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,776
Motherfuckers!

1132
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,536
Machine gun company fall in!

1133
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,760
Blow these son of bitches up!

1134
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,120
Tighter! Let me blow
up those motherfuckers!

1135
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,760
Tie it!

1136
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,360
Strap it on tight!

1137
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,000
Thanks, kiddo!

1138
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,416
Next!

1139
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,816
Their defense is tightening up!

1140
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,816
Quick, bomb it open!

1141
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,856
Jump!

1142
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,576
Hubei Tongxian, Li Mancang!

1143
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,960
Next!

1144
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,200
Mom and dad, I'm sorry!

1145
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,120
Mom!

1146
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,840
Next!

1147
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,440
Hunan Liuyang, Wang Jindou!

1148
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,257
Don't spread out!

1149
01:03:30,281 --> 01:03:31,456
Reform!

1150
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,480
My name is Zhao Mengliang!

1151
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,440
My name is Liu Beiwu!

1152
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,200
Hubei Tongcheng, Sun Shoucai!

1153
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,480
Get down!

1154
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,760
Don't film me.

1155
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,536
Mom!

1156
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,760
I'm leaving!

1157
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,696
Temporarily retreat!

1158
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,056
Save the wounded!

1159
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,096
Medic!

1160
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,536
Reload ammo!

1161
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,536
All units, confirm personnel
and equipment present!

1162
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,240
Ready for another strike!

1163
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,600
If only every Chinese
was as brave as them...

1164
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,040
the Japanese wouldn't even dare.

1165
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,656
Three hours are up!

1166
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,600
The Japanese did not
take over the Sihang Warehouse.

1167
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,896
Three hours are up!

1168
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,960
The Japanese did not
take over the Sihang Warehouse.

1169
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,960
We won!

1170
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,920
Three hours are up!

1171
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,880
Three hours are up!

1172
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,976
Japanese couldn't win!

1173
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,360
Our brothers did it!

1174
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,656
Shall I shoot?

1175
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,176
Aim at the cable roll.

1176
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:46,897
Roger!

1177
01:05:46,921 --> 01:05:48,401
Don't let that wire cross the bridge.

1178
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,056
Don't hit the Germans.

1179
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,080
Roger!

1180
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,056
These kids,

1181
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,736
they all have parents...

1182
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,976
They all are Zhuanzhu
and Yaoli (assassins).

1183
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,656
Last name Qi, first name Heizi.

1184
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,080
I'm from Qizhuang Village,
Dongchangfu, Liaocheng.

1185
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,280
Give this money to my mom.

1186
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,297
I'm from Hefei, Anhui.

1187
01:06:37,321 --> 01:06:38,896
My dad is Tang Xiaobing,
my mom is He Fangchao.

1188
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,960
Give my mother this money.

1189
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,280
There's somebody else!

1190
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,456
Let's perform "Tiaohuache" tonight?

1191
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,816
"The Battle of Changban",

1192
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,960
The seven rounds of battle.

1193
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,256
What's happening there?

1194
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,440
Let's go take a look.

1195
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,240
Get down!

1196
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,920
Gunfire!

1197
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:16,936
Don't go there!

1198
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,616
Do you want to die?

1199
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,377
Don't go further!

1200
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:19,640
You will get shot!

1201
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,656
Stop!

1202
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,680
Let me off!

1203
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,417
They are shooting!

1204
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:26,520
Don't go further!

1205
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,416
My name is Wang Hu!
From Taixing, Jiangsu province.

1206
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,160
Father, mother, I'm sorry.

1207
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,697
Bashu Chamber of Commerce.

1208
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,640
Shanghai Branch, Young Daozi.

1209
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,480
I've always been a fast runner.
I would like to try!

1210
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,280
Daozi, be careful!

1211
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,560
He is going to get killed.

1212
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,000
Be careful! Don't get up!

1213
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,696
This is suicide!

1214
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,896
Don't come here!

1215
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,777
Get out and help!

1216
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:23,200
Provide cover fire!

1217
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,560
Don't get up!

1218
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,120
Stay covered!

1219
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,576
Don't move!

1220
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,376
Don't get up!

1221
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,400
Fuck you!

1222
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,640
Cover fire!

1223
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,920
Grab the phone line!

1224
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,296
I'm a teacher at Shanghai
St. John University.

1225
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,576
We heard the heroes in the warehouse,

1226
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,296
have persevered in
their defence of the city.

1227
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,656
I came here to offer help,

1228
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,736
I brought some food and medicines.

1229
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,376
This is Fang Xingwen,
a journalist from Shanghai News.

1230
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,520
Colonel, Chairman is on the phone.

1231
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,280
Sir, it's Zhongmin.

1232
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,800
Thanks for your help.

1233
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,720
We were all watching your heroic acts.

1234
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:07,737
But,

1235
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:10,760
none of us had any idea
about the difficulties you are facing.

1236
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,736
There's an urgent lack of morphine here,

1237
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,656
you have been holding the ground
for three days now,

1238
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,680
every soldier has reached their limit.

1239
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,456
In reality,

1240
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,640
this kind of resistance
will fail eventually.

1241
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,080
Every single soldier's life is precious.

1242
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,656
If you continue in this way,

1243
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,200
what's the point?

1244
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,800
The point?

1245
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,120
This is our homeland.

1246
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,840
Colonel Xie,

1247
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,240
how many soldiers do
we have in the warehouse?

1248
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,200
420.

1249
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,600
800.

1250
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,456
So can I tell the journalists,

1251
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,200
that there are 800 heroes?

1252
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,400
What are you doing?

1253
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,800
Taking photos.

1254
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,760
To show the people on the outside,

1255
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,376
show the situation in here.

1256
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,480
What situation?

1257
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,376
Whatever the situation is,

1258
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,216
you rich people will
just keep enjoying life as before.

1259
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,616
We are all concerned.

1260
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,800
The entire country is watching you.

1261
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,280
Concerned?

1262
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,720
Why aren't they coming over
to help if they're concerned?

1263
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,280
Just sitting there watching?

1264
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,120
Just sitting there watching?

1265
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,320
Aside from taking photos
as a pussy journalist,

1266
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,840
what else can you do?

1267
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:53,240
I want you to take
my photo, can you?

1268
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,440
Journalist Fang!

1269
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,480
Has anybody seen journalist Fang?

1270
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,800
Journalist Fang!

1271
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,696
Having a miscarriage? You little sissy.

1272
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,800
What are you crying about?

1273
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,560
Brother,

1274
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,280
out of everyone in here,

1275
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:16,480
only you struck me as a smart one.

1276
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,280
If you can really make it out,

1277
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,280
send a message for me.

1278
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,696
Badaoligou in Andong city,

1279
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,016
mention Lao Tie,

1280
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,720
everyone will know.

1281
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,136
Tell my son,

1282
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,960
his dad was not scared of death.

1283
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,560
His dad lived only for him.

1284
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,160
Brother, tell me your real name!

1285
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:43,760
Brother!

1286
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,600
My name is Old Abacus.

1287
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,560
You need to relax, just relax.

1288
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,480
That picture,

1289
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,496
can you mail it to my family?

1290
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,520
Sure.

1291
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,296
Give me an address.

1292
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,376
Show me how it looks like first.

1293
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,696
I can't show you right now,

1294
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,696
if I open the back of the camera,
the film will be ruined.

1295
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,880
When I get back I still
need to develop the film and...

1296
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,097
What's your problem?

1297
01:13:16,121 --> 01:13:17,440
Are you idiot?

1298
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,000
Got any cigarettes?

1299
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,480
Journalist Fang!

1300
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,880
Journalist Fang!

1301
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,216
Let's go.

1302
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,240
Coming.

1303
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,400
I knew I couldn't trust you.

1304
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,520
Fuck off!

1305
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,760
Fuck off!

1306
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,120
If you dare to escape,

1307
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,760
I'll kill you with one shot.

1308
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,000
Brother,

1309
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,160
want to go together?

1310
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,056
Brother.

1311
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,200
Brother,

1312
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,736
look at my hand.

1313
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,760
I can't even pull a trigger.

1314
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,760
I can't even hold a gun.

1315
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,920
What good am I here?

1316
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,160
If I stay,

1317
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,400
will it annihilate the Japanese?

1318
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,336
I'm just scared,

1319
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,016
I'm scared if I die,

1320
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,856
then that's it.

1321
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,296
Brother, brother!

1322
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,840
Brother!

1323
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,640
Brother,

1324
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,440
you have family?

1325
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,080
You got land, right?

1326
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,360
Are you married?

1327
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,536
They arranged a marriage for me
back in my hometown.

1328
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,936
They told me,

1329
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,120
my wife is chubby and sweet.

1330
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,800
I haven't even seen her yet.

1331
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,320
All wars must eventually come to an end.

1332
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,960
People must keep on living
no matter what.

1333
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,856
I only know calculating.

1334
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,256
I don't know how to fight.

1335
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,776
There must be someone
fighting the Japanese.

1336
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,720
There must be someone defending here.

1337
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,256
I admire you all.

1338
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,496
You guys are hero.

1339
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,456
But, I... I don't...

1340
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,120
Brother...

1341
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,880
I'm begging you.

1342
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,936
I'm begging you, brother.

1343
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,480
Leave me a way out.

1344
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,320
I'm begging you.

1345
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,280
There's enough for everyone!

1346
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,760
Give me one!

1347
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,440
Why are you moping?

1348
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,840
Eat it up!

1349
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,000
Once your stomach is
full, you won't miss home.

1350
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,840
What?

1351
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,200
Scared?

1352
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,320
Drink this, then you won't be scared.

1353
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,480
Cheers.

1354
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,000
I'm not scared.

1355
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,120
Bravo!

1356
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:43,856
The warehouse urgently needs
sugar, salt, bread, and water!

1357
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,480
We kindly ask everyone to contribute!

1358
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,416
Every donation matters!

1359
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,640
Stand with our soldiers!

1360
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,600
Don't cry!

1361
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,880
Stop crying!

1362
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,000
What are you throwing that for?

1363
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,856
What are you doing here?

1364
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,760
- Money from a Russian whore is dirty.
- Eva Li.

1365
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,680
My father is Chinese.

1366
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,560
She's hybrid, mixed blood.

1367
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,560
Enjoying the excitement?

1368
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,560
It's all fixed.

1369
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,880
Not bad, kid.

1370
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,280
We have it too,

1371
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,000
it's been over 400 years.

1372
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,120
They always perform
the story of Guan Yu.

1373
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,800
Why did you pick Zhao Zilong?

1374
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,256
The story of Guan Yu
is all about brotherhood.

1375
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,736
Zhao Zilong is different.

1376
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,080
He protects the country.

1377
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,737
Today,

1378
01:19:04,761 --> 01:19:05,961
you were really going to jump?

1379
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,816
Everyone has their own fate.

1380
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,320
My family memorial tablet
was prepared a long time ago.

1381
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,976
One, two, go!

1382
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,256
It's coming!

1383
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,616
Pick it up!

1384
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,160
Come on! Capture all of this!

1385
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,200
Sergeant!

1386
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,696
Journalist Fang,

1387
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:26,657
why are you still here?

1388
01:19:26,681 --> 01:19:27,896
What are you recording?

1389
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,160
Taking photos.

1390
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,560
You're one of those people,

1391
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,136
who fights any battle
just for the money.

1392
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,696
How are you not dead?

1393
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,280
I don't have wife or kids.

1394
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,120
I'm on my own.

1395
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,200
This money is
all for my mother.

1396
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,500
You've never slept with a woman?

1397
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,820
Ever touched a woman's breast?

1398
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,520
What a pity!

1399
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,560
Tell me...

1400
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,400
what does it feel like?

1401
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,040
Give me a pack of cigarettes,

1402
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,016
and I'll tell you the feeling.

1403
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,040
Cigarettes!

1404
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,280
Cigarettes are my life.

1405
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,560
Blood?

1406
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,520
What does this say?

1407
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,000
I can't read.

1408
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,920
It's from the kid who
jumped off the building.

1409
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,040
Words from the heart.

1410
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,776
The warehouse urgently needs
sugar, salt, bread, and water!

1411
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,256
6 o'clock!

1412
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,496
Colonel Xie has made an appeal!

1413
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,720
Let's go have some sweet rice balls!

1414
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,040
Sister Rong's donation.

1415
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,096
I'm hit!

1416
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,560
Xiao Hubei!

1417
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,496
Xiao Hubei!

1418
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,337
What are you shouting for?

1419
01:22:11,361 --> 01:22:12,440
I've been hit!

1420
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:13,896
- I've been hit!
- Let me see.

1421
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,016
- I've been hit!
- Shut up!

1422
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,416
- I'm going to die!
- Let me take a look.

1423
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,616
I've been shot!

1424
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,800
You're fine.

1425
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,376
It's just a graze.

1426
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,217
You're not dying.

1427
01:22:21,241 --> 01:22:22,616
Keep alert!

1428
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,377
Done.

1429
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:24,480
Who's outside?

1430
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,800
A girl!

1431
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:26,737
Get her up.

1432
01:22:26,761 --> 01:22:28,041
There's a sniper across from us.

1433
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,720
Thank you!

1434
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,056
Go report now!

1435
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,080
Report quickly!

1436
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,760
We are here.

1437
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,520
The red circle is Shanghai.

1438
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:47,800
If I die,

1439
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,760
who'd tell you that?

1440
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,016
Dumb little kid.

1441
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,200
You won't die.

1442
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,840
Here.

1443
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,577
Shame on you.

1444
01:23:17,601 --> 01:23:19,016
She's just a girl,

1445
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,520
and she swam across the river.

1446
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,920
Last night,

1447
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,200
you, a big man,

1448
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,040
wanted to swim over there?

1449
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,800
This helps with the pain.

1450
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,120
Does it hurt?

1451
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,200
Brother, you are a hero now.

1452
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,560
Does she smell good?

1453
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:58,800
Colonel Xie!

1454
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,680
Attention!

1455
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,216
Brothers!

1456
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,240
Yes, sir!

1457
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,640
We have just received the order,

1458
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,456
the Brussels Conference is
in session as scheduled.

1459
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,336
The government wants
the entire world to know,

1460
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,416
that the Chinese troops
haven't been defeated!

1461
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,936
The Generalissimo's office ordered us,

1462
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,936
to defend two more days at all costs.

1463
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,256
The longer we defend,

1464
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:24,136
the better chance we will gain support
from the international community.

1465
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,680
- Is that understood?
- Understood!

1466
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,440
First, let's thank this
girl for her bravery.

1467
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,440
Attention!

1468
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,160
However, if we raise this flag,

1469
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,576
it will be a great provocation
for the Japanese Army.

1470
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,120
They will stop at nothing to destroy us.

1471
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,760
They may even use heavy artillery.

1472
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,160
If that's the case,
forget about two days.

1473
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,240
Holding out for even
a few hours will be a struggle.

1474
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,160
What do you say?

1475
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,480
Colonel,

1476
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,176
our superiors' order is to defend
for two more days.

1477
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,960
Shouldn't we postpone the flag-raising?

1478
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,656
Colonel, holding
out two more days,

1479
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,496
If we give it everything we've got,
we have a chance.

1480
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,976
But if we raise the flag tomorrow,

1481
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,220
we will be unable
to complete this mission.

1482
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,696
In my opinion,

1483
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,896
compared to holding out
two more days, raising the flag

1484
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,096
will better declare to the
international community our attitude

1485
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,256
and our people's will!

1486
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,360
Raise the flag!

1487
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,296
Let's show these sons of bitches

1488
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,480
that we are still here!

1489
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,536
This is our home,
why the fuck can't we raise our flag?

1490
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,560
Raise it!

1491
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,816
Only 2 more days to live anyway,

1492
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,840
let's do it!

1493
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,560
We will raise the flag tomorrow morning!

1494
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,480
If anyone wants to leave
any last words to their family,

1495
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,320
let this lady deliver them for us.

1496
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,216
One at a time please.

1497
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,576
Girl, I can't read!

1498
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:01,760
Write one for me!

1499
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,576
Everyone listen up!

1500
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,936
In consideration of
your valiance in battle.

1501
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,096
The Colonel suggests,

1502
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,496
formally incorporating you into
the 524th Battalion,

1503
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:11,696
to form an independent squad,

1504
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,336
directly reporting to the division.

1505
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,800
He expects that you will
all continue to fight bravely.

1506
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,696
Raising that flag is death.

1507
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,536
Isn't this asking us to die?

1508
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,880
Bullshit!

1509
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,000
Whoever doesn't want to be
a part of this, dismiss yourself.

1510
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,200
Really?

1511
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,760
I'm still young.

1512
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,240
I'm leaving.

1513
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,080
I'm going back.

1514
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,920
I'm going home.

1515
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,400
I'm going back.

1516
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,056
Out of my way! I'm going back.

1517
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,080
Stop him!

1518
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,080
Get off me!

1519
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,056
Medic!

1520
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:02,936
Bandage him!

1521
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:03,736
Lock him up!

1522
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,760
Yes, sir!

1523
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,840
Is there anyone else who wants to leave?

1524
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,080
Let me know!

1525
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,640
You used to serve the 33rd Division?

1526
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,280
Originally the 36th Division.

1527
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:23,000
Commander Song's men never falter.

1528
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,896
You will be the squad leader.

1529
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:25,777
Tomorrow morning,

1530
01:27:25,801 --> 01:27:27,200
you lead them to raise the flag.

1531
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:28,840
Can you handle it?

1532
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:31,840
Yes, sir!

1533
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:42,840
Attention!

1534
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,536
Colonel!

1535
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,457
Apart from the guards,
scouts, and the injured,

1536
01:27:50,481 --> 01:27:52,440
all 345 soldiers are here.

1537
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
At ease!

1538
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,560
At ease!

1539
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,840
The Colonel will speak!

1540
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,560
Brothers of the 88th Division.

1541
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:04,880
Over there,

1542
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,080
are observers from the Western nations.

1543
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,400
Behind me,

1544
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,640
are our own people.

1545
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,480
We are not just here
to fight the Japanese,

1546
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,800
but to show them all,

1547
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,840
Chinese people are still here.

1548
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,360
Chinese soldiers are still standing!

1549
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,320
We soldiers have not retreated,

1550
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,560
not even one step.

1551
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,320
As long as we are here,

1552
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,856
They took over the Northeast

1553
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,616
and the North China.

1554
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:39,816
But now,

1555
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,296
because of you,
Shanghai is still standing!

1556
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,840
Yes, sir!

1557
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,097
Dimond!

1558
01:28:48,121 --> 01:28:49,360
Junior apprentice! Come here!

1559
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,720
For our fallen brothers.

1560
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,160
Fire!

1561
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,960
The Chinese nation will not perish!

1562
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,800
The Chinese nation will not perish!

1563
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,696
Long live the Chinese nation!

1564
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,176
The Chinese nation will not perish!

1565
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,480
The Chinese nation will be victorious!

1566
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,736
Long live Colonel Xie!

1567
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,016
Long live the Chinese nation!

1568
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,240
The Chinese nation shall be victorious!

1569
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,576
Colonel,

1570
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,816
there's incoming attack from the north.

1571
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,080
1st Platoon, execute the plan!

1572
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,776
Protect the flag!

1573
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,600
Yes, sir!

1574
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,816
Move!

1575
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,536
Machine Gun Company!
Deploy defence to the north!

1576
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,456
- Sergeant Yang! Protect the flag!
- Yes, sir!

1577
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:48,696
Sergeant Yang! I'm staying.

1578
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,776
- Head to the turret!
- Yes, sir!

1579
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,616
Enter the East building!
Prepare for casualties.

1580
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:53,240
Dispatch soldiers to carry ammunition!

1581
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:15,656
Due South!

1582
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,296
2000 metres, target in sight!

1583
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,576
Loading armor-piercing projectile!

1584
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,600
Six o'clock!

1585
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,256
Watch your altitude,
look out for enemy fire.

1586
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,296
Aim at the flag.

1587
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,456
Get ready!

1588
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,480
Come on!

1589
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,056
Squad 4 Platoon 5, protect the flag!

1590
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,296
Others stand by!

1591
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:49,800
Medic!

1592
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,456
Tighten it!

1593
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:54,920
Hurry up!

1594
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,200
Remove the cartridge! Fast!

1595
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,560
The aircraft is coming!

1596
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,800
Run!

1597
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,416
Hurry! Go get them!

1598
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,656
5th Squad 3rd Platoon, protect the flag!

1599
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,480
Others stand by!

1600
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,816
The barrel is going to burst!

1601
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,560
We're out of water, Sir!

1602
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,760
Medic!

1603
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,600
Help me!

1604
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,120
Die!

1605
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,096
I'm speaking to the Japanese military.

1606
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,776
You must retreat now!

1607
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,776
If you continue to proceed,

1608
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,336
we will consider it as an Act of War.

1609
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,376
I repeat!

1610
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,400
Retreat now!

1611
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,440
Brothers keep it up!

1612
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,400
Hold it up!

1613
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,176
Attention all soldiers!

1614
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,616
Obey orders!

1615
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,736
Don't make unnecessary sacrifices!

1616
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:20,280
No one attacks
without my order!

1617
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,400
Act on my command!

1618
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,336
Rescue the injured!

1619
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,960
No one is allowed to attack

1620
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:30,440
without my order!

1621
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,240
Come and save them!

1622
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,056
Come and save them!

1623
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,176
5th Squad go out and retrieve the injured.

1624
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,920
The rest standby.

1625
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:46,457
Quickly!

1626
01:35:46,481 --> 01:35:47,736
Help them!

1627
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,577
Medic!

1628
01:35:48,601 --> 01:35:49,896
Stretchers!

1629
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:50,976
Quickly!

1630
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,320
Help!

1631
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,840
Move faster!

1632
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:02,800
Save the injured!

1633
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,976
<i>This is HQ,
plane number 0917,</i>

1634
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,896
<i>the British have already
raised objections.</i>

1635
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,016
You'll see!

1636
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,360
<i>0917, return immediately.</i>

1637
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:36,977
Medic!

1638
01:36:37,001 --> 01:36:38,560
Move the injured away.

1639
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,200
They left!

1640
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,200
They left!

1641
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:46,040
They fled!

1642
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:00,937
Clear the battlefield!

1643
01:37:00,961 --> 01:37:02,080
Watch the flagpole.

1644
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:04,800
Brother!

1645
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:06,960
Brother!

1646
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,080
Brother!

1647
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:09,560
Brother!

1648
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:12,840
Brother!

1649
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,360
Xiao Hubei.

1650
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:17,800
Don't be scared.

1651
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,640
I got you.

1652
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,120
Brother!

1653
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,400
Didn't we agree,

1654
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:30,160
- when we got to Shanghai...
- Brother!

1655
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,440
We would take
a ship to England...

1656
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,400
with our uncle,

1657
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,840
with my mom.

1658
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:43,320
I miss my mom.

1659
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,120
There, there...

1660
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,880
Xiao Hubei.

1661
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,960
Didn't we agree?

1662
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,640
Once we are in Shanghai,

1663
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:20,120
we'd take a photo together.

1664
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,240
Take a photo together.

1665
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,760
Come over here!

1666
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:34,840
Take a photo.

1667
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,240
Stretcher coming!

1668
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,360
Take a photo.

1669
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:41,920
Take a photo.

1670
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,280
Take a photo together.

1671
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,840
Take a photo together.

1672
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:44,280
They're singing for us.

1673
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,760
The NRA troops have
been beaten in every fight.

1674
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:51,480
Today we finally restored some pride.

1675
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:53,096
Devoting oneself to one's country,

1676
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:54,880
is an honour.

1677
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:57,217
Thanks.

1678
01:41:57,241 --> 01:41:58,536
The squad leader is here! Quiet!

1679
01:41:58,560 --> 01:41:59,896
- Quiet!
- Make yourself at home.

1680
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,256
Sit down everybody.

1681
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,280
Get seated.

1682
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:14,840
I've spent half of my life
drifting around,

1683
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:20,536
fighting alongside the army.

1684
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:25,600
The lantern swaying in the wind
and reflecting our broken shadow,

1685
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:29,576
I've put my sword in its sheath
and taken off my armour,

1686
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,896
and placed them in the horse stable.

1687
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:32,920
Kiddo!

1688
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:34,240
Kiddo!

1689
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:35,720
What are you reading?

1690
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,480
A letter.

1691
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:40,056
An officer's letter to his wife.

1692
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,656
A love letter?

1693
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:42,680
Read it.

1694
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,976
To my dear wife Yuzhi,

1695
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,376
I'm heading to Luodian with my squad

1696
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,136
to support the troops

1697
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,016
as is our duty.

1698
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:56,096
Yet I can't help
worrying about our families, my parents

1699
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:58,256
my young wife and my children.

1700
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:00,136
I can't help worrying.

1701
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,816
By being frugal,

1702
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,536
you will have adequate
food and clothing.

1703
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,896
Out parents are frail,

1704
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:07,200
make sure to look after them.

1705
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,536
When our kids grow up,

1706
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,336
they shall join the army

1707
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:14,096
to avenge their father.

1708
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:16,840
To devote themselves to their country.

1709
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:19,496
There will be a day,

1710
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,256
when our flag,

1711
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,160
will fly on the peak of Mount Fuji.

1712
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,936
So that our descendants,

1713
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:29,280
won't suffer anymore humiliation.

1714
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:39,280
The restoration of the Han

1715
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:41,440
awaits the younger generation.

1716
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:11,280
An announcement
from the Japanese infantry,

1717
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,840
of the 5th Brigade in Shanghai.

1718
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,720
Why is there a Japanese
vehicle over there?

1719
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,296
What are they shouting about?
It sounds like...

1720
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,976
The Japanese want to
meet with our Colonel Xie.

1721
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,760
Colonel Xie is riding a white horse,
there's Japanese man in front of him!

1722
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:26,296
Are they really retreating?

1723
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,896
I think the NRA won't surrender.

1724
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,096
I heard they are pulling out!

1725
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:31,000
That will be great. All
of them can survive.

1726
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:32,000
No.

1727
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,896
No, it can't be.

1728
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,056
You women,

1729
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,936
how can you take about
our heroes in that way?

1730
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,456
As if they are not worth a thing!

1731
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,096
Watch your mouth!

1732
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:41,136
Move out of the way!

1733
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,600
Alright everyone, shut up!

1734
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,296
There'll be trouble tonight.

1735
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,560
Help me! Give me a hand.

1736
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:57,736
Look! Flare! It's the Japanese!

1737
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,760
Flare!

1738
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:02,120
What are all the soldiers
doing outside?

1739
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:40,576
I'm from the Japanese infantry
of the 5th Brigade in Shanghai...

1740
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,320
They've come right to our doorstep.

1741
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,560
Colonel, just let me kill him.

1742
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:46,777
I'll go.

1743
01:46:46,801 --> 01:46:49,040
Colonel! This could be an ambush.

1744
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:51,360
Commander Yang and Shangguan,

1745
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,336
if anything goes wrong,

1746
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,120
you two take over command.

1747
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,080
Colonel.

1748
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,160
Colonel, are you really going?

1749
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:01,400
Don't worry.

1750
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,896
He's riding a horse,

1751
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:04,440
you're just walking over.

1752
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:59,016
I'm Colonel Konoe Isao
of the Japanese Infantry,

1753
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:02,136
5th Brigade, 68th Regiment.

1754
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,136
NRA 88th Division,

1755
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:07,060
524th Regiment, Colonel Xie Jinyuan.

1756
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:11,920
You are quite tenacious!

1757
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:14,616
For the past three months,

1758
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:17,576
you have been
the most admirable opponent.

1759
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:21,536
I understand you have
received order to retreat.

1760
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:25,536
I've also received order
to use heavy artillery tomorrow.

1761
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:29,056
Thus, our battle will
finally come to an end.

1762
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:31,976
Henceforth, people will
no longer pay attention to this battle.

1763
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,600
That's none of my business.

1764
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,560
It is your business!

1765
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:42,200
After this, there will be a new
commander filling in for me.

1766
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:45,680
I will become a failure.

1767
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,400
So,

1768
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:51,120
I'm not here representing the army.

1769
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,480
Go on.

1770
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:58,040
Tomorrow, we will have
one last chance to battle.

1771
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:05,400
It is a battle of honour
between you and me.

1772
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:11,360
This is also a fight
between us two men.

1773
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:14,856
There are only a few hours left

1774
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,576
before the battle starts.

1775
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:17,377
Brothers!

1776
01:49:17,401 --> 01:49:18,736
Get it together!

1777
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:20,336
This is our last fight.

1778
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:22,840
Right now you are laying
your own graves!

1779
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:25,216
Carry those who die first over here.

1780
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:26,496
Kiddo,

1781
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,280
you don't even know my name.

1782
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:33,616
88th Division, 524th
Regiment, 1st Battalion,

1783
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:34,920
Qi Jiaming.

1784
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,240
Bottom up.

1785
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,536
Shangguan,

1786
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:53,736
their bodies are all they have.

1787
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,720
Nobody knows who is
going to collect their bodies.

1788
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:59,616
According to our ancient tradition,

1789
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:01,216
before seeing the ancestors in heaven,

1790
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:02,960
they need to be washed.

1791
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,320
Boil some water from the river.

1792
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,520
Let them clean themselves.

1793
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:38,416
Commissioner,

1794
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:40,136
Colonel is having a migraine.

1795
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:41,720
He sent me down for you.

1796
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,056
Instruction from the Generalissimo.

1797
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:50,520
At midnight tonight,
the defenders in Sihang warehouse,

1798
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,656
shall evacuate the warehouse
to the British concession.

1799
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:54,960
Here is the order.

1800
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:58,720
October 30th, 1937.

1801
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,920
Zhongmin, cheers.

1802
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:10,016
Boil the water,
put in the bucket.

1803
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,040
Got it!

1804
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,200
Commissioner,

1805
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,416
our determination to guard the warehouse

1806
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:16,896
has been passed onto
the Chief by Zhang Boting.

1807
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,616
I believe our brave efforts

1808
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:21,320
can gain us international
support at the conference.

1809
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:26,120
The Nine-Power Treaty conference
has been postponed.

1810
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:27,976
Or one could say,

1811
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,360
preemptively aborted.

1812
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:32,800
The delegation has already
found out the stance of each nation.

1813
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,496
The British and the US
care more about their own interests.

1814
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:36,896
No one is willing to help us.

1815
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:38,720
Shangguan, it's the end.

1816
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Just wash up!

1817
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,776
Our sacrifices couldn't have
just been a show for the foreigners?

1818
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,576
We fought and failed for 3 months.

1819
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:49,456
The NRA stood for
the nation and totally collapsed.

1820
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:51,640
People feel defeated,
soldiers are afraid to fight.

1821
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:54,160
Commissioner, I believe this battle

1822
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:57,280
will reinvigorate the
soldiers' morale and confidence.

1823
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:00,600
So what? The outcome
is a foregone conclusion.

1824
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:04,200
Shanghai will be occupied by the enemy.

1825
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:07,456
If 700,000 NRA failed,

1826
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:09,320
what makes you think
400 of you can succeed?

1827
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:11,920
Xu Jiahui.

1828
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:14,600
Shangguan Zhibiao.

1829
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:21,056
In 1932,

1830
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:22,680
the Japanese also attacked Shanghai.

1831
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:24,616
One gasoline bomb,

1832
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:26,080
wiped out half of a company.

1833
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,520
He's considered lucky,
he hung onto his life.

1834
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:33,960
3rd Platoon, 1st Squad...

1835
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:36,320
Look across the bank.

1836
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:38,800
The people's eyes are on us.

1837
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,256
Their support for the
resistance against Japan

1838
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:42,720
is getting stronger.

1839
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:45,960
Soon it will fade away.

1840
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,200
The passion of these people,
can not change the war.

1841
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:52,480
I don't believe it!

1842
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,920
This will leave a mark in history.

1843
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,120
These people will be remembered.

1844
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:59,880
Then let's leave it to
the later generations to discuss.

1845
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:03,240
I'll be honest with you.

1846
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:07,520
The Generalissimo
orders you to remain here,

1847
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,440
is just a show put on
for the western world.

1848
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,640
If your men persevere,

1849
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,560
you will not be warriors anymore.

1850
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:20,160
Have you seen the actors
on the boat across the river?

1851
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:24,480
Don't turn this heroic undertaking

1852
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:27,720
into a bigger joke, Zhongmin.

1853
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:34,880
This is how you
all define this battle?

1854
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:46,200
Zhongmin,

1855
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:52,800
the nature of war
is always politics.

1856
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:54,336
3rd Platoon, 7th Squad!

1857
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:55,376
Yes, sir!

1858
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:56,600
7th Squad fall out!

1859
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,320
The concessions have
already agreed to take you in.

1860
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:00,840
Retreat.

1861
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:05,240
It's meaningless to keep
on fighting this war.

1862
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:07,216
The little hope you brought

1863
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:10,016
- will eventually become a great desperation.
- Sir, 7th Squad all present!

1864
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:11,017
- Proceed.
- Yes, sir!

1865
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:14,120
If you leave the warehouse,
the glory will be gone,

1866
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:16,840
but at least your soldiers
will survive.

1867
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:20,816
They are all flesh and blood,
they all have parents and siblings.

1868
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:22,680
As a soldier, I wish...

1869
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:25,520
to defend us in this time
of danger for our ancestors.

1870
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,760
300,000 soldiers were killed out there!

1871
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,096
Now you're telling me
they all have flesh and blood?

1872
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,920
All have parents and siblings?

1873
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:37,560
The government thought that
if they stopped the invasion.

1874
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,360
There would be room for negotiation.

1875
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,960
But the fact is

1876
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,480
our military strength
doesn't even come close.

1877
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:53,536
If the war keeps on going,

1878
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:55,160
spreading all over the country

1879
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,440
eventually the civilians
will suffer the most.

1880
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:02,480
They will suffer even
more attacks, death and separation.

1881
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:07,440
This country
has gone through enough.

1882
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:08,936
Win or lose,

1883
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,176
I just hope this
war can end sooner.

1884
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:12,536
So the civilians can suffer less.

1885
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:14,320
So the nation can suffer less.

1886
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,200
Compared to these civilians.

1887
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:21,840
Xie Jinyuan's glory
is not important.

1888
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:34,320
Zhongmin,

1889
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:37,920
the Generalissimo's central army
has been greatly reduced.

1890
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,440
Save some of our elites.

1891
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:44,560
When retreating,

1892
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,120
don't instigate new battles.

1893
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:50,800
Have the miscellaneous
troops provide cover.

1894
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,200
Attention!

1895
01:55:58,040 --> 01:55:58,937
Brothers.

1896
01:55:58,961 --> 01:56:00,696
The Japanese have
already warned the concessions.

1897
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,616
Regardless of the consequences,

1898
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:05,560
they will use all available methods
including heavy artillery.

1899
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:08,080
If the gas tank is ignited,

1900
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,040
the concessions will
turn into a sea of fire.

1901
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:13,880
2 million fellow Chinese
will die with us.

1902
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,936
Therefore, the superiors
have given the command.

1903
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,496
Tonight at midnight,

1904
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:20,376
when the British turn off
the searchlights,

1905
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:21,760
we retreat to the concession.

1906
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:25,656
The British requested us
to retreat via the bridge.

1907
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:27,976
Look sharp and stay organised!

1908
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,776
Any soldier who tries to swim across

1909
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:31,120
will not be granted access.

1910
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:33,800
The entire world is watching us.

1911
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:35,256
Keep your chins up!

1912
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,480
- Yes, sir!
- This retreat...

1913
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:39,840
needs to be well equipped
and meticulously organized.

1914
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,240
So I will be in it with all of you.

1915
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:46,176
In order to get more people out of here,
some people need to stay behind

1916
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:47,480
to cover the retreat.

1917
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:49,680
Who volunteers to stay behind?

1918
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,200
Write down your name.

1919
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,256
The brother who choose to stay,

1920
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:55,216
- Stay alive.
- We are the forlorn hope

1921
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:56,096
to attack the enemy.

1922
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:56,777
I'll stay.

1923
01:56:56,801 --> 01:56:58,960
To buy more time for
our brothers to cross the bridge.

1924
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:02,360
I'm here for vengeance.

1925
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:04,740
It is true that...

1926
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:08,040
we lost this battle.

1927
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:10,220
But why?

1928
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:13,200
Because our nation is sick!

1929
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:16,120
Letting others bully us like this!

1930
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:18,376
We should be asking ourselves
if we've done our best!

1931
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:19,560
I'll stay.

1932
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:20,976
Count me in.

1933
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,416
Will you help carry me over there?

1934
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:23,480
Count me in as well.

1935
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:33,440
Can you mail that photo to my hometown?

1936
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,760
- I don't want to die.
- I've promised you.

1937
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:39,400
Jinyang County, Shanxi Province,

1938
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:42,360
Zhangkou Village, the Shi carpenters,

1939
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:44,200
it's all for my mother.

1940
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:49,880
I'll take care of it.

1941
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,760
And this...

1942
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,880
it's from the kid who
jumped off the building.

1943
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,456
Brothers of the 88th Division!

1944
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:09,600
Yes, sir!

1945
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,080
You are all well-trained,
German equipped forces.

1946
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,560
Each of you is one of
this country's most elite soldiers.

1947
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:19,520
You are also
the best medicine for this country.

1948
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:23,240
The 400 of us showed
the people across the river

1949
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:24,936
that there is still hope for China!

1950
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,256
In order of squad number, move!

1951
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:27,816
1st Company, 2nd Platoon,
1st Squad, Get ready!

1952
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,680
1st Company, 4th Platoon, 5th Squad,
get ready!

1953
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,600
These citizens

1954
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,200
will be the seed to awaken more people!

1955
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:37,160
Brothers, remember!

1956
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:40,000
You need to survive tonight.

1957
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,496
As long as there's one of us alive,

1958
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:45,296
then our glory will never disappear!

1959
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:46,656
Those who survived

1960
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:49,376
will represent us
to join the national counterattack.

1961
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:51,056
For tonight's retreat,

1962
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:53,016
your mission is to survive.

1963
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:54,040
Remember!

1964
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:58,280
Survival is victory!

1965
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:00,960
I learned Guiguzi's tactics

1966
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:02,640
in order to rob graves.

1967
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:05,000
But now we are building graves!

1968
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:10,240
We were digging graves
from the beginning.

1969
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:16,480
You're growing stubble.

1970
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:25,616
Pussy, where are you going?

1971
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:28,736
Pussy, pussy... You're the pussy!

1972
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:30,240
Greasy old fellow!

1973
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:44,360
Pussy,

1974
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:49,400
want cigarettes?

1975
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:01,960
Tell me,

1976
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,960
what does it feel like?

1977
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:15,960
Once you lay
your eyes on them,

1978
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:19,040
then your head is dizzy.

1979
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:21,540
When you grab and rub them,

1980
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:24,280
your hand is soaked
in the tenderness.

1981
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,936
Tremors softly like water,

1982
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:30,600
and your body just trembles.

1983
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:44,880
So nice...

1984
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,280
In my next life...

1985
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:52,920
I'll give it a good try.

1986
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,456
Inform all companies,
cross the bridge in groups of twenty.

1987
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:11,360
- We need to be fast.
- Yes, sir.

1988
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:12,856
- Attention all companies!
- Where is Xiao Hubei?

1989
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,920
Break into groups of twenty,
charge across the bridge!

1990
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:16,180
We need to be fast!

1991
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:17,620
Attention all companies!

1992
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:18,896
Groups of twenty,

1993
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:19,920
charge across the bridge.

1994
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:22,656
Turn off the lights and
watch out for snipers.

1995
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:24,760
Find cover when the lights go on.

1996
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:26,440
Groups of twenty,

1997
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:27,920
charge across the bridge!

1998
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:03,440
Colonel, my great grandpa
told me when I was a kid.

1999
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:05,960
The Zhu's Empire
was taken over by the Manchus.

2000
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:08,600
None of his descendants fought back.

2001
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:10,520
It wasn't right.

2002
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:12,496
Now the Japanese are here,

2003
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,600
I shouldn't run again,
right, Colonel?

2004
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:21,040
Look at the other side.

2005
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:24,640
Just the 400 of us aren't
enough to fight back.

2006
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:27,520
We need to rely on
the 400 million people behind us.

2007
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:31,080
We are going out there to wake them up.

2008
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,920
No one knows what this country
will become in the future.

2009
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:38,296
So you need to survive,

2010
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:39,696
grow up well.

2011
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:41,040
When you grow up,

2012
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:43,640
you will be able to see
this country become better.

2013
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:04,600
Pussy, let me send you off?

2014
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:10,200
Sure.

2015
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:22,560
Pussy,

2016
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:24,840
cigarettes are your life.

2017
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:05,680
Brothers.

2018
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:07,280
See you in next life!

2019
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:10,200
See you in next life!

2020
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:13,200
See you in next life!

2021
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:22,960
Let's go!

2022
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:11,216
Everyone, get ready!

2023
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:12,240
Yes, sir!

2024
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:16,360
Japanese.

2025
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:18,600
Shoot the lights off.

2026
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,536
Jun and Lei! Get on it!

2027
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:21,600
Yes, sir!

2028
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:36,280
Flare!

2029
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:41,360
Take cover!

2030
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,240
Everyone move inside!

2031
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:52,336
Everyone move inside!

2032
02:05:52,360 --> 02:05:53,360
Hurry up!

2033
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:56,456
The Japanese have been waiting for us.

2034
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:58,577
Send one group first.
Draw out the enemies' firing positions.

2035
02:05:58,601 --> 02:05:59,736
- I'll lead the squad.
- Colonel, I'll go.

2036
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:01,096
- Colonel!
- Everyone shut up!

2037
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:03,137
Commander Yang will take
over the command, give me the gun!

2038
02:06:03,161 --> 02:06:04,176
Yes, sir!

2039
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:06,680
Then charge across
the bridge in squad order.

2040
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:10,196
Each life that makes it
counts, understand?

2041
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:11,640
Understood!

2042
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:14,617
Everyone!

2043
02:06:14,641 --> 02:06:15,680
Take cover!

2044
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:43,656
Stand by!

2045
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:45,216
Everyone stand by!

2046
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:47,640
1st Platoon ready!

2047
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:53,920
This letter arrived just in time,

2048
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:57,720
God brought Huang Zhong
a chance to claim victory.

2049
02:06:58,240 --> 02:07:02,000
He stands outside of the military
camp shouting out his commands:

2050
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:06,016
All soldiers, listen carefully!

2051
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:09,976
First beat, preparing the food.

2052
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,816
Second beat,
tightening up the armours.

2053
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:17,296
Third beat, pulling out the knives.

2054
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:20,736
Fourth beat, starting the battle.

2055
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:24,016
Follow the commands
no matter what,

2056
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:27,856
those who defy orders
will be executed.

2057
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:33,776
Then we will return with victory!

2058
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:35,416
They are standing in positions!

2059
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:36,856
Prepare to attack!

2060
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:39,040
All squads report!

2061
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,216
Sir, enemies sighted!

2062
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:49,160
Everyone! Battle position!

2063
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,120
Stand still!

2064
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:54,080
Stand still!

2065
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:56,920
Stop there or we will open fire!

2066
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,000
Ready!

2067
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:00,440
Fire!

2068
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:07,680
Colonel, the counter-fire has begun!

2069
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:11,280
Charge!

2070
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:17,760
Cross the bridge now!

2071
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:20,800
Don't look back! Run!

2072
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:23,360
Get up! Get up now!

2073
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:27,817
Charge!

2074
02:08:27,841 --> 02:08:30,096
2nd group, get ready!

2075
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:31,296
2nd Squad and 3rd Squad are up!

2076
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:33,800
2nd Squad and
3rd Squad, follow me!

2077
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:40,256
Go! Keep up the pace!

2078
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:42,256
Provide cover fire!

2079
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:43,616
Get ready to help!

2080
02:08:43,640 --> 02:08:45,840
North! Four shooting points!

2081
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:49,456
Don't shoot at the concession area!

2082
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:51,160
Aim at your target!

2083
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:07,536
Help! Leave no man behind!

2084
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:09,400
Don't get caught up with fight!

2085
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:13,816
Increase firepower!

2086
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,440
Don't let them cross the bridge!

2087
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:19,056
There's a firing point to the west!

2088
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:20,800
Take cover!

2089
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,160
Anyone who can still move,
keep crawling forward.

2090
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:32,400
Cross even if you have to crawl!

2091
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:46,576
Save me sir!

2092
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:49,320
I'm a soldier from,
Sichuan, the 26th Division!

2093
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:52,560
Keep crawling!

2094
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:57,120
Save them!

2095
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:20,856
I'll go support the Colonel,
I'm leaving the team with you!

2096
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:22,776
Zhang Zhigiang and Jiao
Yousan! Come with me!

2097
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:23,840
Commander Yang!

2098
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:42,160
Fucking Japanese!

2099
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:51,600
Bastards.

2100
02:10:58,240 --> 02:10:59,720
Shameless!

2101
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:05,880
Get out of the way!

2102
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:11,200
Morphine

2103
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:19,640
Sister Rong, go ahead!
I'll pick it up!

2104
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:32,200
Kill that officer!

2105
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:43,480
Suppress enemy fire!
Protect the Colonel! Fall out!

2106
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:46,616
All soldiers!
Move forward and fall in!

2107
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:48,360
Wait for my command!

2108
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:51,720
Cover each other!

2109
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:16,776
They are all our compatriots!

2110
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:18,240
Save them!

2111
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,536
I can't do this anymore!

2112
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:25,720
Just shoot me!

2113
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:53,160
Let me answer the
question you asked earlier.

2114
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:57,076
No one knows,

2115
02:12:57,160 --> 02:12:58,780
how this history will be written.

2116
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:01,320
I don't have faith in today's
political situation either.

2117
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:03,960
But I believe...

2118
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:07,480
our descendants
will remember this place.

2119
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:10,040
Our country,

2120
02:13:10,780 --> 02:13:13,200
will remember
everything you did.

2121
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:18,380
Your people
are the true Chinese people.

2122
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:23,640
These are my honest thoughts.

2123
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:38,760
Everyone charge across the bridge!

2124
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:48,080
Everyone charge across the bridge!

2125
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:51,360
Everyone charge across the bridge!

2126
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,320
Everyone charge across the bridge!

2127
02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:01,736
All soldiers, form two rows!

2128
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:03,376
Don't return fire!

2129
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:04,696
Don't get caught up with fighting!

2130
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:06,136
Assist the injured!

2131
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:07,216
All soldiers!

2132
02:14:07,240 --> 02:14:09,336
Charge across the
bridge as fast as possible.

2133
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:11,360
Our fellow people across
the river are watching us.

2134
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:13,496
Be courageous!

2135
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:15,080
Yes, sir!

2136
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:17,320
Wait for my order!

2137
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:20,800
Ready!

2138
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:45,880
Charge!

2139
02:17:52,450 --> 02:18:27,250
