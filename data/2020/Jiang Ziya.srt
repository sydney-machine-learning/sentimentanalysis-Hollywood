00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:24,584
In the last years
of the Shang Dynasty,

3
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,685
<i>Emperor Zhou
became a fatuous tyrant.</i>

4
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,285
<i>Seeing an opportunity,</i>

5
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:32,518
<i>The Fox Devil, Nine Tailed,
transformed herself into Daji,</i>

6
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,818
<i>the Royal Consort</i>

7
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,886
<i>and took control
of the government.</i>

8
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,785
<i>The Fox clan brought chaos
to the world.</i>

9
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:41,618
Heaven took pity on the people.

10
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,152
<i>When at last
they rebelled,</i>

11
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:47,319
<i>the Master of Jingxu Hall
sent divine reinforcement.</i>

12
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:51,553
<i>Thus the Three Realms
were engulfed in war.</i>

13
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:08,584
Jingxu Hall's
foremost disciple, Jiang Ziya,

14
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,584
<i>set forth to vanquish Nine
Tailed once and for all.</i>

15
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:18,651
My love, what have you done?

16
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:19,751
Where are you?

17
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:24,586
Enough! Stop this at once!

18
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:28,520
Jiang Ziya.

19
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:31,453
Aah...

20
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:41,419
Your illusions
do not frighten me, Fox Devil!

21
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,152
We have the same goal,
do we not?

22
00:02:47,154 --> 00:02:50,087
Must we quarrel
over a single, pitiful dynasty?

23
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:56,451
It is mankind's destiny
to serve the Fox Clan forever!

24
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:01,584
I invoke the Suppressing Seal!

25
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:03,551
Malignant spirits.

26
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:04,886
Be vanquished!

27
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,752
<i>The war came to an end.</i>

28
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:53,518
<i>For its victory
over Emperor Zhou,</i>

29
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,052
<i>Jingxu Hall was lauded.</i>

30
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:58,052
<i>The Revered Master bequeathed
unto the people gods</i>

31
00:03:58,054 --> 00:04:00,788
<i>tasked with the protection
of all living things.</i>

32
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,518
With the rise of a new Dynasty,

33
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,919
<i>there was much
to be done.</i>

34
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:08,118
<i>Those loyal to the old order
were banished</i>

35
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,988
<i>to the icy ruins of Beihai,
never to return.</i>

36
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:26,152
<i>For his role in
the triumph,</i>

37
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:29,886
<i>Jiang Ziya
was celebrated far and wide.</i>

38
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:32,020
<i>It was thought
he would lead the new gods.</i>

39
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,754
<i>And yet...</i>

40
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,584
What'd I say?

41
00:05:05,586 --> 00:05:08,385
Why is that rock shaped
so weird?

42
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:10,686
When's the last time you've
ever seen a rock around here?

43
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:12,152
I'm gonna take a look.

44
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:13,120
Freeze!

45
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,919
Things aren't... Whoa!

46
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,419
Uh...

47
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,484
Ugh...

48
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,652
That's no rock.
It's one of the Immortals.

49
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:26,686
- Immortals?
- Immortals?

50
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:29,152
Behold. Following the Great War,

51
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:32,252
Jingxu Hall let down
a stairway to heaven

52
00:05:32,254 --> 00:05:34,120
and invited mankind to ascend.

53
00:05:35,254 --> 00:05:36,752
The first person to climb it

54
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,352
was none other than
Jiang Ziya himself.

55
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:41,954
That's how he became a god.

56
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:34,920
I have completed the mission
given to me.

57
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:37,518
Jiang Ziya.

58
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,819
The Fox Devil you have subdued
cannot be permitted to live.

59
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:44,484
As the Three Realms look on.

60
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:48,252
Nine Tailed must be executed.
By you.

61
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:51,752
With this act
shall you secure your place

62
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,052
as leader of the gods.

63
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:55,152
As you are
a servant of the people,

64
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:58,252
so shall the disciples
of Jingxu Hall be yours

65
00:06:58,254 --> 00:07:00,652
to command
in upholding Heaven's will.

66
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:01,754
Then so it is done.

67
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:46,752
Kill her!

68
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:48,152
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

69
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:49,787
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

70
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,451
Kill!

71
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:05,319
Kill!

72
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:11,385
Kill!

73
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:17,621
Kill!

74
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,152
Nine Tailed.
These illusions are fruitless.

75
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:32,853
Your fate is sealed.
This is how you end.

76
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:37,152
So loyal.

77
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:41,152
What right does your Master have
to presume the will of Heaven?

78
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,519
He has saved mankind
from your evildoing.

79
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:45,753
Has he indeed?

80
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:48,787
Uh...

81
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:51,885
Very well.

82
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:55,720
Why does he not move
to save her?

83
00:08:57,422 --> 00:08:58,552
Who is that?

84
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:01,120
You know nothing of the truth.

85
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,352
This girl, she's...

86
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:05,785
Jiang Ziya!

87
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:10,052
Do not let her sow the seeds
of doubt in your mind!

88
00:09:10,054 --> 00:09:11,587
Kill her!

89
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,820
Prepare to meet your end!

90
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:33,918
Kill!

91
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,552
Kill!

92
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:42,020
Kill!

93
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:44,652
Look out!

94
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:46,652
Her sorcery!

95
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:58,587
Resist the illusion! Stay pure!

96
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:11,587
See me! Take off the mask!

97
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:15,587
Huh?

98
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:20,420
Mark my words,
you will be executed!

99
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:24,220
If I die,

100
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:26,720
she dies.

101
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:35,985
Save me.

102
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:43,487
Master, there is an innocent
in her clutches!

103
00:10:48,154 --> 00:10:49,487
Huh! No, wait!

104
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,020
Let her go!

105
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:26,152
Uh...

106
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:28,386
Come on! Get it together!

107
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,252
It's been long enough!

108
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:31,720
I want to go home!

109
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,952
You have undone
the seal. You must be punished.

110
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:42,420
But I saw an innocent spirit

111
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:43,519
within Nine Tailed.

112
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:44,618
Silence!

113
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,353
What you saw
was a conjuring trick!

114
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:48,218
But is seemed so...

115
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,851
Were Nine Tailed
loose in the mortal realm...

116
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:53,185
The devastations
of the great war

117
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:54,751
would have been for naught.

118
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:58,485
Fortunately,
the Fox Devil has been executed.

119
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:02,487
But you are hereby
banished from Jingxu Hall!

120
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:06,584
I know what I saw.

121
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:07,820
Jiang Ziya.

122
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,551
Master.

123
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:13,785
I have no choice
but to seal your divine power

124
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:15,584
and exile you to Beihai

125
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:18,286
until such time as you
are no longer in thrall

126
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,420
to this wicked illusion.

127
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,820
Only then may you return.

128
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:29,085
This job stinks.

129
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:32,551
Emperor Zhou gets to be
the God of Marriage, but me?

130
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:34,584
I'm stuck looking after you.

131
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,052
I'm a baby sitter!

132
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,185
Ah! Four-Alike?

133
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:41,785
No! That's for the three of us
to share!

134
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:44,954
Oh, I see how it is!
You wanna bite me! Fine!

135
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:47,286
Huh!

136
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:49,353
With a straight hook?

137
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:52,286
This fish is as dumb as you are.

138
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:56,219
What... Oh!
You've got to be kidding me.

139
00:12:56,221 --> 00:12:57,687
Unbelievable.

140
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:00,885
Look at you.

141
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:03,853
They get to go home, meanwhile
we're rooted to the spot!

142
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,154
I'll do it!

143
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,484
Uh... Wha...

144
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:13,584
I'll break this thing
into splinters!

145
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:17,520
Don't test me! Humph!

146
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:20,018
Stop!

147
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,188
Do you want to go back
to Jingxu Hall or not?

148
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,253
Come on!
It was all in your head!

149
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:31,651
Um... Nine Tailed
played a trick on you.

150
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:32,751
It's like that saying

151
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:34,386
about flies only going
for cracked eggs.

152
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:37,518
Not that I'm, you know, calling
you an egg or anything...

153
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,685
- Go home.
- Huh?

154
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,120
You deserve better.

155
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,653
It's been ten years.

156
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:45,553
This is my punishment.

157
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:49,486
Ugh...

158
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:06,186
You're a damn fool.

159
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:08,054
If it weren't
for the Master's orders,

160
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,486
I'd be long gone.

161
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,987
Four-Alike.

162
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Huh?

163
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:25,685
I've got one eye.

164
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:26,751
Two big mouths.

165
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:28,119
Three whole arms.

166
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:29,419
And four legs!

167
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:30,484
You lose!

168
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:31,685
Look at these beauties!

169
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:32,985
- What?
- Drink!

170
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:37,186
Bunch of morons.

171
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:40,985
What? You filthy urchin!

172
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:43,319
- Mommy! He's bullying me!
- Get back here!

173
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:45,451
Which one of you lowlifes
is picking on my child?

174
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:46,518
I'll rip you apart!

175
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,119
Excuse me?

176
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,518
Oh, oh... Oh.

177
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,286
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

178
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,851
It burns!

179
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:01,385
Stinking devils
always causing trouble.

180
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:04,019
Confiscate their weapons!

181
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:07,352
Cowards! Nine Tailed would'a
killed ya if you hadn't fled!

182
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:09,219
She'd have taken you lot first!

183
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:10,618
She can smell fear!

184
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,053
Says the one who reeks of it!

185
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:18,952
Jiang Ziya?

186
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:20,518
Why is he here?

187
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,618
Killjoy.

188
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,188
Hmm... Huh...

189
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:45,885
Oh-oh!

190
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:47,484
If it isn't
the big shot immortal

191
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:49,653
who got us all
imprisoned here! Huh?

192
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:52,651
Excuse me.

193
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:54,385
Humph. Well, hey!

194
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:55,953
At least
we're all in this together.

195
00:16:55,955 --> 00:16:57,186
Gotta be worse for you, though!

196
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:59,285
Scum of the Three Realms
ousted from Jingxu Hall!

197
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:00,818
Oh, that's a good one!

198
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,584
The scum of the Three Realms!

199
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:07,584
- Scum!
- You hear that?

200
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,153
So what if you won the war?

201
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:11,385
You're still
stuck here with all of us!

202
00:17:11,387 --> 00:17:13,618
Barkeep. How much for rice?

203
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,186
My, my.

204
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:20,685
What a rare treat this is.

205
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:24,419
Beihai is on a barter system.

206
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:28,484
The Whip of the Gods
would suffice!

207
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:31,188
- What about this?
- Hmm...

208
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:33,720
Kunlun moire.

209
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,785
Your, associate Shen Gongbao

210
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:40,785
was here earlier,
weeping himself silly.

211
00:17:40,787 --> 00:17:44,086
Ah. Poor fellow.
Forced to trade his earring.

212
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:48,419
Did you two have a spat?

213
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:50,753
Oh now, don't take it to heart.

214
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:52,520
Ha!

215
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:57,518
Life squeezes us
one way or another.

216
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,385
Get over it and move on,

217
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:01,888
or lay down arms
and accept defeat.

218
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:06,818
Sometimes,
the only thing standing

219
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,019
between us and what we want
is admitting we're wrong.

220
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,653
What you saw
was a conjuring trick!

221
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:22,787
Well. Someone
likes making an entrance.

222
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:35,119
Step aside.

223
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:36,451
You're a new face.

224
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:39,551
Tell me, girl, are you looking
for someone in particular

225
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:40,687
or just trouble?

226
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,319
Just trouble.

227
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:46,953
Is that a fact?

228
00:18:49,055 --> 00:18:50,921
Okay, okay! You win!

229
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,019
She's good.

230
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,220
Strong little one, eh?

231
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:01,888
Huh?

232
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:09,319
I'm looking for a place.

233
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:10,218
It's her.

234
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,187
Yeah? And what "place"
might that be, missy?

235
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,252
Somewhere very unique.

236
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:18,518
Where the black flowers bloom.

237
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,852
Black flowers?

238
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:22,551
Yeah, sorry. Not ringin' a bell.

239
00:19:22,553 --> 00:19:23,953
You seen anything
like that before?

240
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:28,252
Interesting. There is only one
such place in the Three Realms.

241
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:30,451
Mount Youdu,

242
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:33,419
the traveler's despair!

243
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,584
You know what I'm talking about?

244
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:37,419
Where is it? Tell me!

245
00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:40,019
- Hmm.
- Don't smirk. I know the score.

246
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:42,419
Youdu was once

247
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:44,584
a sacred mountain
not so long ago.

248
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:46,852
It's where Emperor Zhou
was given the title

249
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:50,152
"God of Marriage".
Oh, how times have changed.

250
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:51,919
Strange things are afoot.

251
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:53,751
Black flowers thrive unchecked

252
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:56,118
along the mountainside,
hiding the path.

253
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,185
All who search for it
miss the mark.

254
00:19:58,187 --> 00:20:01,154
Ah, but lucky for you
I just so happen to have a map.

255
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,118
And of course,
much more besides.

256
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,285
I trade in rare beasts,
souvenirs, travel essentials...

257
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:09,419
Everything!

258
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:11,651
Yes.

259
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:14,919
There sits Mount Youdu,
in all its glory!

260
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:17,052
- Let me see!
- Not so fast!

261
00:20:17,054 --> 00:20:20,484
Just the other day, a group
of downtrodden fox hunters

262
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,352
tried to haggle for this item.

263
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:26,085
If one credits their word,
the mountain is haunted,

264
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:27,352
by Fox Devils!

265
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:30,484
But.. weren't they driven
to extinction?

266
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:31,752
If the Fox Devils have returned,

267
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:33,185
the Three Realms
will be thrown into chaos!

268
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:35,018
Such a young thing you are.

269
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,419
What business can you have
with so frightful a place?

270
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:42,484
That's none of your concern.
Is the map for sale or isn't it?

271
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:43,986
I appreciate your fire.

272
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:46,218
But the first rule
of negotiation dictates

273
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,154
that all goods
are subject to inspection!

274
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,618
You stay out of this!

275
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,385
What sort of
despicable operation are you...

276
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:00,685
You tried to trick me!

277
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:01,953
Meddler.

278
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:07,686
What are you doing?

279
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:08,786
Grab the wretch!

280
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:11,352
What the?

281
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,721
My inventory!

282
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:16,955
My Jingxu divination stone!

283
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,252
No! Wait!

284
00:21:30,254 --> 00:21:33,352
That's immortal wine!
I've been saving it for years!

285
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:36,218
You don't say? Well, then...
It's worth sharing!

286
00:21:38,054 --> 00:21:39,052
Huh?

287
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:41,618
- Hey!
- Wait I don't...

288
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,584
Someone stop her!

289
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:44,719
Hands off!

290
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,120
I'll offer a reward!

291
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:49,520
The map!

292
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:54,486
- Someone catch it!
- Get the wine!

293
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:58,686
That's a good boy.
Just hand me the map.

294
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:00,352
No, no, no!

295
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:01,419
- Spit it out!
- What are you...

296
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,985
- waiting for? Take her down!
- Spit it out right now!

297
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:04,352
Kill her if you have to!

298
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:06,919
Leave her be!

299
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:10,721
Ugh! Very well!
I'll do it myself!

300
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,020
Fox!

301
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:35,819
Devil!

302
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:39,451
If we hand her over
to Jingxu Hall,

303
00:22:39,453 --> 00:22:40,518
we're as good as freed!

304
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,752
None of you get in my way!

305
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:43,486
Be careful!
They'll want the head intact!

306
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:52,652
Down there!

307
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:53,754
I see her!

308
00:22:59,453 --> 00:23:01,018
Don't let her get away!

309
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,220
Hurry!

310
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:07,985
Huh?

311
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,819
Where do you think you're going?

312
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:13,285
- Stop!
- Huh?

313
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:14,453
What is...

314
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:16,654
Who are you?

315
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,552
Jiang Ziya! Slow down!

316
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:28,220
You're about to cross
the boundary!

317
00:23:38,688 --> 00:23:40,385
Good thing I can keep up.

318
00:23:40,387 --> 00:23:41,851
If you'd left Beihai,

319
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,319
you'd be in defiance
of the Master.

320
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:45,585
And that would be bad.

321
00:23:45,587 --> 00:23:46,851
Really, really bad.

322
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:49,085
Look, all that stuff
I said earlier.

323
00:23:49,087 --> 00:23:50,585
I'm just trying to help!

324
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:54,686
Hey, whoa! Whoa! Don't do it!

325
00:23:54,688 --> 00:23:56,818
I can only return
to Jingxu Hall...

326
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,686
by first uncovering the truth.

327
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:02,619
Huh? Please! Be reasonable!

328
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:06,419
Ah! He's starved.
He's not thinking clearly.

329
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:08,484
Uh... Okay.

330
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:10,218
If I have to cross,
then so be...

331
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:15,554
Jiang Ziya's out of his mind.

332
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:19,719
It's freezing. Get him inside.

333
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:23,954
Ha! He's in league
with the Fox Devil!

334
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,587
Huh?

335
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:05,154
Huh!

336
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:12,554
Who are you?

337
00:25:13,154 --> 00:25:14,054
Give that back!

338
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:23,419
Speak. What is your connection
to Nine Tailed?

339
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:29,152
How far the mighty Jiang Ziya
has fallen.

340
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,751
Treating an innocent little girl
like a common hoodlum.

341
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:34,420
- Oh, save it!
- Murderer!

342
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:39,385
So much for being an immortal.

343
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:41,252
Are all of you
this unreasonable?

344
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:44,352
If anyone's connected
to the Fox Devil, it's you.

345
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:46,952
So that bracelet?

346
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:49,420
- Is none of your business!
- It belonged to Nine Tailed.

347
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,352
Why are you wearing it?

348
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:52,853
What are you talking about?

349
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,820
It belongs to me!

350
00:25:58,987 --> 00:25:59,987
Stop!

351
00:26:07,987 --> 00:26:09,020
Nine Tailed!

352
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,154
No!

353
00:26:32,787 --> 00:26:35,521
Spirit-taming fires, rise!

354
00:26:48,254 --> 00:26:49,552
What were those?

355
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:51,185
What do they want with you?

356
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:54,218
Excellent question.

357
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,785
How the hell should I know?

358
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:58,052
They've been after me
from the moment I woke up.

359
00:26:58,054 --> 00:26:59,154
There's more every time.

360
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,285
I'm guessing
it has to do with my past.

361
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:05,818
I don't really know.

362
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,454
The only clue is this bracelet,
and the memory of black flowers.

363
00:27:15,254 --> 00:27:16,885
Mount Youdu.

364
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:20,085
Sometimes I can see my father.

365
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:21,618
Waiting for me.

366
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,252
He can prove I'm not a devil!

367
00:27:24,254 --> 00:27:27,585
Do not let her sow
the seeds of doubt.

368
00:27:27,587 --> 00:27:30,085
You're coming with me
to Jingxu Hall!

369
00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:31,152
Are you listening?

370
00:27:31,154 --> 00:27:32,687
I have to find my father!

371
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,918
He has saved
mankind from your evildoing.

372
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,487
You know nothing of the truth.

373
00:27:41,254 --> 00:27:43,218
I have no choice but to seal

374
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,320
<i>your divine power
and exile you to Beihai</i>

375
00:27:46,322 --> 00:27:48,751
<i>until such time as you
are no longer in thrall</i>

376
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:50,521
<i>to this wicked illusion.</i>

377
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:00,452
What is this?

378
00:28:00,454 --> 00:28:01,653
Who are you?

379
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,620
Very well.

380
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:20,553
Let's go.

381
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:22,685
Where?

382
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:24,519
To Mount Youdu.

383
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:26,120
Wait, are you serious?

384
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:29,920
Yes. Are you afraid?

385
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:32,651
A-Afraid?

386
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:34,718
What kind of question is that?

387
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,085
And don't act all high
and mighty, it's my map!

388
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:39,154
Hey, wait up!

389
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,618
That hasn't healed yet?

390
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,651
I have something
that might help.

391
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:01,185
My secret recipe!

392
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:05,420
It's yours. If you give me
a peek at the map.

393
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:08,185
I thought we were friends!

394
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:09,952
I wasn't aware
we'd graduated to that.

395
00:29:09,954 --> 00:29:11,985
Whatever,
it's only a matter of time.

396
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:13,718
We just have
to get to know each other.

397
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,353
Good idea.

398
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:17,085
- Let's start with you.
- Huh?

399
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:18,187
You're not an immortal.

400
00:29:19,422 --> 00:29:20,885
So how did you cross
into Beihai?

401
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:22,818
Uh...

402
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,484
That's kind of personal.

403
00:29:24,486 --> 00:29:26,851
- Are you normally this blunt?
- Uh...

404
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:28,818
Why I should even trust you?

405
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,718
You're dressed like a vagrant.

406
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,420
A desperate vagrant.

407
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:34,918
For all I know
you see me as a bounty.

408
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,887
Huh?

409
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,085
Ah!

410
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,586
And you see me as a mark.
Uh, wait!

411
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,253
Okay, okay, okay.

412
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,118
You're so arrogant! That tone.

413
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:00,551
Four-Alike, that's enough.

414
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:02,718
Four-Alike?

415
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,885
So this is
the legendary creature

416
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,818
said to move with such grace?

417
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,453
Fearsome? Big as the night sky?
Makes men tremble?

418
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:12,753
How adorable.

419
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:18,851
Don't antagonize.

420
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:21,219
It left Jingxu Hall
on my account.

421
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:25,651
Oh sure.
Sounds like a reasonable story.

422
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:28,253
Or maybe it just
couldn't cut it in Heaven.

423
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,518
Give that back! I was kidding!

424
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,419
Four-Alike!

425
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:36,451
Hey, tough guy! How 'bout
you control your pet?

426
00:30:36,453 --> 00:30:39,219
Ugh! I'll slap a muzzle
on that face!

427
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:41,954
Get back here!

428
00:31:04,753 --> 00:31:06,584
All right, fun's over!

429
00:31:08,255 --> 00:31:09,952
Don't you even!

430
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:11,484
Those are mine!

431
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:14,484
Four-Alike!

432
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:17,119
Ugh! When I get my hands on you!

433
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:19,353
Is that all immortals
really are?

434
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:20,885
A bunch of glorified thieves?

435
00:31:20,887 --> 00:31:22,887
First the map, now my biscuits.

436
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:26,651
Huh?

437
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:28,887
Stop.

438
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,253
Ugh! It's just
a stupid wind chime.

439
00:31:34,255 --> 00:31:35,718
They're all over the place.

440
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,385
Spirits are supposed
to be comforted

441
00:31:37,387 --> 00:31:39,518
by the sound of bones rattling.

442
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,820
Something like that, anyway.

443
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:44,853
Like a consolation prize
for being dead.

444
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,086
Huh?

445
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:50,618
These are messages
from their loved ones.

446
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,385
A connection to life.

447
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:55,253
They're a comfort
to the living and the dead.

448
00:31:57,486 --> 00:31:59,253
The war is over.

449
00:31:59,255 --> 00:32:01,320
The Fox Clan has been defeated.

450
00:32:01,322 --> 00:32:03,086
The world is healing.

451
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,887
Rest in peace, all of you.

452
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:12,753
Sentimental crap if you ask me.

453
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,153
Ugh. That sedative
knocked me out cold.

454
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:45,221
Okay. Where's
the stubborn bastard gone to?

455
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,986
He's hurt? Of course, he is!

456
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:51,920
Damn it!

457
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:55,584
<i>"The Field
of the Undying is known</i>

458
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:58,153
far and wide
for its trees that don't die,

459
00:32:58,155 --> 00:33:03,088
flowers that don't wilt,
and springs that don't run dry."

460
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,651
Charming place.

461
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,253
Blame it on the Great War.
Everything changed.

462
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,186
You know,
if the heat's getting to you,

463
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:14,551
I'm more than happy to navigate.

464
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:16,851
Thank you, no.

465
00:33:16,853 --> 00:33:19,687
Get away!
I don't have any food left!

466
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:22,088
Uh, huh?

467
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,121
<i>Cut
her ears off!</i>

468
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:46,086
Uh...

469
00:33:46,088 --> 00:33:48,155
Water. I need water.

470
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:55,153
You can't do anything for him.
There's barely enough for you.

471
00:33:55,155 --> 00:33:58,486
I'm not letting him die.
That's all there is to it.

472
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:02,685
Let go! Stop it!

473
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:04,919
He doesn't deserve saving!

474
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:07,186
Fox!

475
00:34:12,387 --> 00:34:13,818
The man's a fox hunter.

476
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,021
He only sees me as game.

477
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,986
Who came to my rescue

478
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:21,119
when they tried
to cut off my ears?

479
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:23,751
Whatever he is,
he hasn't harmed you!

480
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:25,053
Just give him the chance!

481
00:34:25,055 --> 00:34:27,019
- Don't!
- Fine!

482
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,618
Have it your way!

483
00:34:30,421 --> 00:34:31,785
Follow her.

484
00:34:31,787 --> 00:34:34,319
Calm yourself.
I only mean to help.

485
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:35,751
Hear me, Five Emperors.

486
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:37,618
Ye benevolent powers
that govern the body,

487
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,851
heed my command and heal this...

488
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:42,153
The fox is mine,
do you understand me?

489
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:44,921
You can find your own
on Mount Youdu.

490
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,888
Fox Devil.

491
00:35:00,154 --> 00:35:01,854
Damn your trickery.

492
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,787
Mount Youdu it is.

493
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,484
Once upon a time,

494
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:12,352
there was an immortal
from Heaven.

495
00:35:12,354 --> 00:35:13,818
Sadly, without his map,

496
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,653
there wasn't
a whole lot he could do. Huh?

497
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,019
Ravens.

498
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,651
You guys always assume
you're in charge.

499
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:28,518
Till I snap your necks!

500
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:52,486
Help!

501
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:57,088
I want to go home!

502
00:36:02,753 --> 00:36:04,118
What the...

503
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,553
Well, okay then...

504
00:36:10,854 --> 00:36:13,218
What is this thing?

505
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,120
Move!

506
00:36:34,387 --> 00:36:35,685
Get out of here!

507
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:38,687
- Uh...
- Take Four-Alike! Go!

508
00:36:52,054 --> 00:36:54,955
Ha! Whoa! Come back!

509
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:00,653
Idiots.

510
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:07,651
I told her
to get you out of here!

511
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:17,821
Stupid mutt!

512
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,484
What are you doing?
Quickly, give me the whip!

513
00:37:30,486 --> 00:37:32,385
- I'm trying!
- Look out!

514
00:37:32,387 --> 00:37:33,888
Oh no!

515
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,586
The wind chime.

516
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:49,586
Give it the wind chime.

517
00:38:20,453 --> 00:38:23,120
Those things, were they human?

518
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,618
At one time.

519
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,087
Huh?

520
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:33,319
They're lost souls.

521
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:34,788
Those who left home.

522
00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:37,752
Died on the battlefield.

523
00:38:37,754 --> 00:38:40,754
No graves. No friends or family.

524
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:43,721
No hope of finding
their way back.

525
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:47,154
No way home? That's awful.

526
00:38:52,453 --> 00:38:54,087
Blame the Great War.

527
00:39:08,688 --> 00:39:10,621
Will they be
trapped here forever?

528
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,154
Quite possibly.

529
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,352
There's some hope
for them, though.

530
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:18,619
The Swallow.

531
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:21,152
A great beast said
to traverse the sky

532
00:39:21,154 --> 00:39:22,721
when moved by human grief.

533
00:39:25,854 --> 00:39:27,551
<i>When
moved by human grief.</i>

534
00:39:29,154 --> 00:39:31,453
<i>Jiu.</i>

535
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,054
You okay?

536
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,887
I have a home and a family.

537
00:39:41,453 --> 00:39:43,252
My father's waiting.

538
00:39:43,254 --> 00:39:44,520
- I'll find him.
- Huh?

539
00:39:52,587 --> 00:39:53,686
This will be able
to calm your wound.

540
00:39:53,688 --> 00:39:56,120
The map.
What'll we do without it?

541
00:40:16,587 --> 00:40:18,419
Silly creature.

542
00:40:21,754 --> 00:40:23,686
Yeah, you're pretty cute.

543
00:41:13,321 --> 00:41:14,487
Ha!

544
00:41:40,554 --> 00:41:41,987
Uh...

545
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,185
Father...

546
00:41:48,187 --> 00:41:49,452
Get inside.

547
00:41:49,454 --> 00:41:51,485
Devil.

548
00:41:51,487 --> 00:41:53,120
He's only a child!

549
00:41:56,287 --> 00:41:58,385
Fox Devil! Get her!

550
00:41:58,387 --> 00:41:59,918
Don't let her get away!

551
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:05,054
Give him the knife.
Let him do it.

552
00:42:08,954 --> 00:42:10,818
Cut her ears off!

553
00:42:20,354 --> 00:42:21,454
A nightmare?

554
00:42:22,853 --> 00:42:25,818
"May you sleep
the sleep of the just..."

555
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,885
That's the most practical chant
I've ever heard.

556
00:42:30,887 --> 00:42:32,220
Is it like a traditional one?

557
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:35,987
It's not exactly a chant.

558
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,452
It's from the Great War.

559
00:42:41,454 --> 00:42:43,619
Soldiers used to say it
before bed.

560
00:42:43,621 --> 00:42:44,918
The Great War.

561
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,687
Was Four-Alike part of it?

562
00:42:48,388 --> 00:42:50,386
The last time we were here,

563
00:42:50,388 --> 00:42:52,120
all this was ocean.

564
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:55,851
Four-Alike crossed it
with a single step

565
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:57,851
and shattered enemy ranks.

566
00:42:57,853 --> 00:43:01,154
Vanquish Nine Tailed,
and the world would be restored.

567
00:43:02,654 --> 00:43:05,853
At least that's what
we all told ourselves.

568
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,918
But it didn't work out that way.

569
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,954
The world just fell
into greater ruin.

570
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:13,851
You think this place had it bad.

571
00:43:13,853 --> 00:43:15,487
You should see where I'm from.

572
00:43:19,587 --> 00:43:22,118
Uh, of course, I'm kidding.

573
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,087
Actually, I bet
you'll think it's beautiful.

574
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,386
So, you know, worth the journey.

575
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:30,818
What are the odds
your father is still there?

576
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,720
Uh...

577
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,587
Really wish I could tell you.

578
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,585
I haven't been able
to remember anything.

579
00:43:40,587 --> 00:43:42,220
Not since waking up
in the desert.

580
00:43:43,753 --> 00:43:45,587
I dream, though.

581
00:43:46,487 --> 00:43:47,954
About this doll he made.

582
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,552
A little thing.

583
00:43:51,554 --> 00:43:52,885
All strung with stones.

584
00:43:52,887 --> 00:43:55,753
Just clinking away
in the breeze.

585
00:43:57,254 --> 00:43:59,085
It was like a windchime.

586
00:44:00,587 --> 00:44:02,252
Calling me home.

587
00:44:06,554 --> 00:44:09,851
Whenever I'd sneak away,

588
00:44:09,853 --> 00:44:11,720
he'd hang it above
the front door.

589
00:44:14,422 --> 00:44:16,154
The wind would pick up.

590
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,487
And I'd follow the sound back.

591
00:44:24,288 --> 00:44:25,851
Jiu.

592
00:44:25,853 --> 00:44:28,087
In the dream
that's what he calls me.

593
00:44:30,355 --> 00:44:32,687
And the place
where the black flowers bloom?

594
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:35,487
That's where he's waiting.

595
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,885
It's not just a dream.
It's real.

596
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:52,720
My whole purpose in life.

597
00:44:55,987 --> 00:44:57,620
You better believe
I'll find him.

598
00:45:03,853 --> 00:45:05,454
Huh...

599
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:15,853
It's the Swallow.

600
00:46:14,887 --> 00:46:17,618
The restless souls
have been called home.

601
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,020
The Swallow has given them hope.

602
00:46:43,388 --> 00:46:44,653
Shall we go?

603
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,085
According to the map

604
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:49,551
the tail of the Milky Way
points to Mount Youdu.

605
00:46:54,388 --> 00:46:55,751
Now we're friends.

606
00:46:55,753 --> 00:46:57,221
Eat up, you'll need it.

607
00:46:58,388 --> 00:47:00,018
Impressive memory.

608
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:07,085
Stop sniffing at me.
I don't have any more biscuits.

609
00:47:08,753 --> 00:47:10,720
Except that one!
That one's mine!

610
00:47:13,421 --> 00:47:15,987
Give it back! Ugh!

611
00:47:22,853 --> 00:47:24,286
"When you
see the Stone Forest,

612
00:47:24,288 --> 00:47:26,484
<i>follow Heishui upstream."</i>

613
00:47:26,486 --> 00:47:28,818
<i>The entrance to Mount Youdu
must be up ahead.</i>

614
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,353
<i>Are you sure?</i>

615
00:47:31,355 --> 00:47:33,651
All I see is a bunch of rocks.

616
00:47:33,653 --> 00:47:34,887
And dirt.

617
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:37,253
I'm sure.

618
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:39,520
There's more here
than meets the eye.

619
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,718
Black flowers?

620
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,052
We've gotta be close!

621
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:47,419
Watch out!

622
00:47:49,355 --> 00:47:52,518
Jiang Ziya!

623
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:58,785
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

624
00:47:58,787 --> 00:48:02,253
You can't just leave Beihai!
Rules are rules!

625
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:03,952
Rules you've now broken too.

626
00:48:03,954 --> 00:48:08,885
I had no choice! The Fox Devil
was making an idiot of you!

627
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,385
- Let's go back before...
- I can't go back yet.

628
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,785
Wha...

629
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:14,651
I, uh, think you're buddy's
about to explode.

630
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:17,121
Jiang Ziya!

631
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,885
Your face.

632
00:48:19,887 --> 00:48:21,551
That wound should've healed!

633
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:23,551
C'mon, your powers
are dwindling.

634
00:48:23,553 --> 00:48:25,453
Damn it.
Do you wanna die out here?

635
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:29,551
I will return to Beihai...

636
00:48:29,553 --> 00:48:31,419
when I have uncovered the truth.

637
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:32,885
Truth about what?

638
00:48:32,887 --> 00:48:35,286
She's the girl I found
in Nine Tailed clutches.

639
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:37,186
I have to know who she is.

640
00:48:37,188 --> 00:48:39,053
Huh?

641
00:48:39,055 --> 00:48:41,419
Uh... This is her?

642
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:42,851
- Why are you so an...
- Speak!

643
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,618
- Put her down!
- What are you?

644
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,918
You've been possessed.

645
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,551
Let go! I don't have
to tell you anything!

646
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:49,484
Stubborn, aren't we?

647
00:48:49,486 --> 00:48:51,352
- Show me your true form!
- Shen Gongbao!

648
00:48:56,255 --> 00:48:57,985
Four-Alike!

649
00:48:57,987 --> 00:48:59,186
Huh?

650
00:48:59,188 --> 00:49:01,785
- Get back here?
- Stop!

651
00:49:01,787 --> 00:49:04,985
Four-Alike. Where are you?

652
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:06,055
Four-Alike!

653
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:08,987
Huh...

654
00:49:09,486 --> 00:49:10,653
Uh...

655
00:49:15,288 --> 00:49:17,620
- Uh?
- Over here.

656
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:21,853
This way.

657
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,055
Father?

658
00:49:24,653 --> 00:49:25,853
Is that you?

659
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,887
Father!

660
00:49:37,387 --> 00:49:38,918
Use your head.

661
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,385
How many lives
did the Fox Devil destroy?

662
00:49:41,387 --> 00:49:44,319
If the truth is so important
to you, open your eyes!

663
00:49:46,954 --> 00:49:48,851
- Things aren't what they seem!
- Bullshit!

664
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:51,153
We've been down
this road before!

665
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,553
You are hopeless!

666
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:01,584
That which is inescapable

667
00:50:01,586 --> 00:50:03,620
we call fate.

668
00:50:04,553 --> 00:50:07,086
That which is unbreakable

669
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:08,785
we call love.

670
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:14,352
Father, is that you?

671
00:50:14,354 --> 00:50:15,785
"Father?"

672
00:50:17,088 --> 00:50:19,953
Foolish child,
I am not your father.

673
00:50:19,955 --> 00:50:23,885
- Humph. Who are you?
- Ooh, what a question!

674
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:29,352
I bind the fates
of mortals together.

675
00:50:29,354 --> 00:50:32,153
I am the God of Marriage!

676
00:50:35,887 --> 00:50:38,785
You're deranged! Untie me!

677
00:50:38,787 --> 00:50:40,687
As you wish.

678
00:50:49,021 --> 00:50:52,019
Your face
is so exquisitely familiar.

679
00:50:52,021 --> 00:50:55,285
Uh, ah...

680
00:50:55,287 --> 00:50:58,019
The Lock of Destiny?

681
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,185
You recognize my bracelet?

682
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:01,787
How could I not?

683
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,285
It isn't a bracelet.

684
00:51:08,287 --> 00:51:11,419
See. It's a very powerful lock.

685
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:12,319
What?

686
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:15,551
It binds two spirits together
inexorably.

687
00:51:15,553 --> 00:51:19,718
If one should perish,
then so shall the other!

688
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,685
My beloved consort
wore the companion

689
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:26,252
to this very lock on her person,
which can only mean

690
00:51:26,254 --> 00:51:29,419
the two of you
are bound together eternally!

691
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:34,319
When the chain materializes,
I'll be able to find her again!

692
00:51:37,453 --> 00:51:42,185
Materialize, my love!

693
00:51:48,088 --> 00:51:49,451
Jiu!

694
00:51:49,453 --> 00:51:51,818
Don't you run away from me!

695
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,551
Where are you? Come to me!

696
00:51:58,787 --> 00:52:02,986
Son of a... Why do you keep
making the same mistakes?

697
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:07,953
You're the Fox Devil
that cost my beloved her life!

698
00:52:11,021 --> 00:52:12,088
Jiu!

699
00:52:19,088 --> 00:52:20,453
Look out!

700
00:53:01,955 --> 00:53:03,854
- Sorcery.
- You see it now?

701
00:53:09,087 --> 00:53:11,218
It's her. She's...

702
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,618
Why?

703
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,319
Why murder the woman
I cherished?

704
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:17,685
Why destroy my kingdom?

705
00:53:17,687 --> 00:53:19,385
She did this.

706
00:53:19,387 --> 00:53:21,419
It's all her doing.

707
00:53:21,421 --> 00:53:24,120
What you see is evil incarnate.

708
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,653
Kill her.

709
00:53:28,287 --> 00:53:29,921
Kill her.

710
00:53:31,421 --> 00:53:34,352
Kill her.

711
00:53:34,354 --> 00:53:36,154
Kill her.

712
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:50,854
No one is waiting
for you anywhere.

713
00:53:53,854 --> 00:53:55,620
I have to find my father.

714
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:06,385
Jiu!

715
00:54:06,387 --> 00:54:07,553
Stop!

716
00:54:08,387 --> 00:54:09,653
Kill her!

717
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,685
Kill her!

718
00:54:11,687 --> 00:54:14,721
No. If she dies so will my love!

719
00:54:41,453 --> 00:54:43,087
Aah...

720
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,385
Jiang Ziya.

721
00:54:51,387 --> 00:54:54,352
How long has it been?

722
00:54:56,254 --> 00:54:57,952
Nine Tailed.

723
00:54:57,954 --> 00:55:00,451
It's you. Didn't the holy device
behead you?

724
00:55:00,453 --> 00:55:03,020
Jiang Ziya saved me.

725
00:55:05,187 --> 00:55:06,821
Let her go!

726
00:55:07,421 --> 00:55:08,721
Release her!

727
00:55:16,154 --> 00:55:17,154
Ha!

728
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:28,252
My mortal body
was indeed beheaded.

729
00:55:28,254 --> 00:55:31,252
But as long as my spirit endures

730
00:55:31,254 --> 00:55:34,118
taking physical form is simple!

731
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,719
Enough! Foul sorceress!

732
00:55:36,721 --> 00:55:38,419
No one cares!

733
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:43,451
Where did this precious kitty
come from?

734
00:55:43,453 --> 00:55:45,285
Watch out!

735
00:55:45,287 --> 00:55:47,052
Ten short years.

736
00:55:47,054 --> 00:55:51,652
That's all it's taken for you
to sink this low, Jiang Ziya.

737
00:55:51,654 --> 00:55:54,888
How utterly heartbreaking.

738
00:55:56,321 --> 00:55:58,419
Don't you find that sad?

739
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,018
Jiu?

740
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,218
Oh, forgive me.

741
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:05,285
I should call you Su Daji.

742
00:56:05,287 --> 00:56:07,553
My beloved.

743
00:56:08,788 --> 00:56:09,852
Behold.

744
00:56:09,854 --> 00:56:13,518
The Zu family's eldest daughter.

745
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,419
Betrothed to Emperor Zhou.

746
00:56:16,421 --> 00:56:19,352
Such a simple human girl.

747
00:56:22,654 --> 00:56:24,686
- Wha...
- Hmm...

748
00:56:24,688 --> 00:56:26,551
What have you done
with my father?

749
00:56:28,621 --> 00:56:31,218
Think carefully, child.

750
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,688
The memory will come to you.

751
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:46,185
Is that you?

752
00:56:46,187 --> 00:56:47,920
Uh... Father, what?

753
00:56:49,788 --> 00:56:50,987
Go.

754
00:56:53,621 --> 00:56:56,952
<i>I crept into
your ceremonial carriage</i>

755
00:56:56,954 --> 00:56:59,851
and took your shape for my own.

756
00:56:59,853 --> 00:57:03,788
<i>And I becamethe Emperor's
cherished consort.</i>

757
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,052
And yet...

758
00:57:06,054 --> 00:57:08,385
This lock was meant
to tether you.

759
00:57:08,387 --> 00:57:10,786
Binding you to me forever.

760
00:57:12,354 --> 00:57:15,686
Your spirit is strong.
It escaped, taking with it

761
00:57:15,688 --> 00:57:20,719
your former body and
a small measure of my power.

762
00:57:20,721 --> 00:57:23,120
And now? You must return!

763
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,285
Stop!

764
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,688
Cursed feline!

765
00:58:03,321 --> 00:58:04,887
Hiya!

766
00:58:21,621 --> 00:58:23,085
Master?

767
00:58:24,887 --> 00:58:25,952
Alas,

768
00:58:25,954 --> 00:58:28,885
a lock forged
by the Revered Master

769
00:58:28,887 --> 00:58:31,187
is not for the likes
of you to break.

770
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:34,454
My Power.

771
00:58:35,154 --> 00:58:36,820
My Power!

772
00:58:38,521 --> 00:58:41,220
Shit! Her power's coming back!

773
00:58:41,954 --> 00:58:42,987
Master.

774
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:45,218
The truth...

775
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,118
- I have to know.
- Don't listen!

776
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,452
She wants to confuse you!
Don't give credence to her lies!

777
00:58:50,454 --> 00:58:52,851
You dare call me a liar?

778
00:58:52,853 --> 00:58:56,054
Heaven is meant
to protect all living things.

779
00:58:57,621 --> 00:58:59,085
Have you any notion

780
00:58:59,087 --> 00:59:01,686
of the atrocities committed
by your Revered Master?

781
00:59:01,688 --> 00:59:03,987
Shen Gongbao!

782
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,985
That said.

783
00:59:06,987 --> 00:59:11,319
If not for Jiang Ziya's kindness
toward one in peril,

784
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:15,818
never would I have had
the opportunity to break free.

785
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:19,987
It's a pity you're so mired
that truth eludes you.

786
00:59:23,422 --> 00:59:26,152
- Let them go.
- Don't despair, child.

787
00:59:26,154 --> 00:59:27,619
I won't kill you.

788
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,587
Jiu!

789
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,218
Four-Alike!

790
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:51,785
Conceal.

791
00:59:51,787 --> 00:59:53,818
- The lock!
- Run!

792
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,653
You're not going anywhere!

793
00:59:57,254 --> 00:59:58,487
Faster!

794
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,420
The lock remains!

795
01:00:06,422 --> 01:00:08,319
You cannot hope to save her!

796
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:10,386
There is no escape!

797
01:00:10,388 --> 01:00:14,587
The Fox Clan will rise again!

798
01:00:45,322 --> 01:00:46,787
- You were right.
- Huh?

799
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,987
No one's...

800
01:00:49,653 --> 01:00:50,820
No one's...

801
01:00:51,954 --> 01:00:53,187
waiting for me.

802
01:01:02,687 --> 01:01:04,286
Four-Alike, what's wrong!

803
01:01:04,288 --> 01:01:05,487
Watch out!

804
01:01:06,254 --> 01:01:08,154
Jiu!

805
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,954
Four-Alike!

806
01:01:18,987 --> 01:01:20,753
Huh... No.

807
01:01:24,887 --> 01:01:26,552
Eight Effulgences
of the Three Regions,

808
01:01:26,554 --> 01:01:27,651
heed my command.

809
01:01:27,653 --> 01:01:28,952
Eight Effulgences
of the Three Regions,

810
01:01:28,954 --> 01:01:29,851
heed my command.

811
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,353
Eight Effulgences
of the Three Regions,

812
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:32,618
heed my command.

813
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,154
Eight Effulgences...

814
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:39,787
Just hold on.

815
01:02:00,322 --> 01:02:01,586
What's happening?

816
01:02:17,586 --> 01:02:18,787
Four-Alike.

817
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,687
Fore-Alike.

818
01:04:11,121 --> 01:04:13,054
Where are you?

819
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,820
There you are.

820
01:04:20,387 --> 01:04:21,787
My love.

821
01:04:23,322 --> 01:04:26,353
What is the world coming to,

822
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:29,518
when even
you can become a deity?

823
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,985
Return her to me.

824
01:04:31,987 --> 01:04:36,221
Your consort is as dead
as your legacy.

825
01:04:37,155 --> 01:04:38,887
Farewell.

826
01:04:54,421 --> 01:04:56,718
All these years...

827
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,121
people thought
you were bewitched.

828
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,253
In the end,

829
01:05:01,255 --> 01:05:02,687
we were the fools.

830
01:05:05,255 --> 01:05:08,186
Jingxu Hall
will eliminate Nine Tailed.

831
01:05:08,188 --> 01:05:10,486
But if the Lock of Destiny
isn't broken.

832
01:05:11,853 --> 01:05:14,987
If Nine Tailed dies,
she'll die, too, Won't she?

833
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:20,586
I don't get it.

834
01:05:22,255 --> 01:05:24,952
If the Master forged it
with his own hands,

835
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:27,584
what are we supposed to do?

836
01:05:27,586 --> 01:05:29,021
What do we even believe?

837
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,088
Why don't we go to the source?

838
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:47,820
I'll speak with him myself
and have the lock undone.

839
01:05:52,954 --> 01:05:53,920
Appear!

840
01:06:05,954 --> 01:06:07,820
They won't lower the stairway
for you anymore.

841
01:06:10,188 --> 01:06:11,651
Wait.

842
01:06:11,653 --> 01:06:12,885
It's too costly!

843
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:14,887
You're not alone in this.

844
01:06:18,155 --> 01:06:19,618
Go to them.

845
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:21,885
Find the answer!

846
01:06:52,453 --> 01:06:54,021
I seek the Revered Master.

847
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:56,620
Presumption.

848
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:03,285
You were ordered
to contemplate your errors.

849
01:07:03,287 --> 01:07:05,685
And instead, you chose to leave.

850
01:07:05,687 --> 01:07:07,252
You should be punished.

851
01:07:07,254 --> 01:07:09,153
Which I accept willingly.

852
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:13,451
But Nine Tailed lives.
Her spirit tied to an innocent.

853
01:07:13,453 --> 01:07:15,484
The master knows the truth!

854
01:07:15,486 --> 01:07:16,818
Silence!

855
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,586
You may not pass!

856
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,451
If he has nothing to hide

857
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:24,785
then why
will he not speak to me?

858
01:07:24,787 --> 01:07:26,988
How dare you!

859
01:07:28,387 --> 01:07:30,919
Did you fasten
the Lock of Destiny?

860
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,753
Does Nine Tailed
share your blood?

861
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:40,385
Is this the way of Heaven?

862
01:07:40,387 --> 01:07:42,453
Would you sacrifice a child?

863
01:08:19,088 --> 01:08:19,988
Master.

864
01:08:22,921 --> 01:08:24,218
Jiang Ziya.

865
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:26,651
Everything Jingxu Hall does,

866
01:08:26,653 --> 01:08:29,520
it does with the sole aim
of protecting life.

867
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:32,419
Tell me, please.

868
01:08:32,421 --> 01:08:35,055
Why would you have me believe
what I saw was a mere illusion?

869
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:40,854
Because the scope
of your understanding is small.

870
01:08:43,055 --> 01:08:44,818
Your heart is kind.

871
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,152
But your compassion, scattered.

872
01:08:47,154 --> 01:08:49,685
Your sense
of the greater good is skewed.

873
01:08:49,687 --> 01:08:53,185
I ordered you
to execute Nine Tailed.

874
01:08:53,187 --> 01:08:56,584
Not to crush evil, but kindness.

875
01:08:56,586 --> 01:08:57,955
Crush kindness?

876
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:01,484
But,

877
01:09:01,486 --> 01:09:03,086
what is wrong with kindness?

878
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:07,285
In itself, nothing.
But, alas, for gods...

879
01:09:07,287 --> 01:09:11,486
Kindness shown
to one person only is a sin.

880
01:09:14,486 --> 01:09:17,651
One day there will come a time

881
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:21,586
when a god
must sacrifice one to save all.

882
01:09:25,055 --> 01:09:29,019
Jiang Ziya must return
to Beihai immediately.

883
01:09:29,021 --> 01:09:31,718
Once his mind
is free of illusion.

884
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,819
He may return
to his rightful place

885
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:35,751
as leader of the gods

886
01:09:35,753 --> 01:09:38,653
and protector
of the Three Realms.

887
01:09:41,653 --> 01:09:43,720
If I fail to save one life,

888
01:09:44,653 --> 01:09:46,087
how can I save all?

889
01:09:47,753 --> 01:09:48,986
Insolence!

890
01:09:48,988 --> 01:09:52,220
You would put
one life above all else?

891
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,021
They're all connected.

892
01:09:58,321 --> 01:09:59,720
Like drops of water.

893
01:10:00,921 --> 01:10:04,085
Life is an ocean. In my eyes,

894
01:10:04,087 --> 01:10:08,087
Jiu, and all living things,
are one and the same.

895
01:10:10,421 --> 01:10:14,520
The great war ripped untold
soldiers from home and family.

896
01:10:17,354 --> 01:10:20,419
I'm ashamed of my role.

897
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:22,520
I no longer want to be a god.

898
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,986
To have power.

899
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:29,553
All I want
is to save whoever I'm able.

900
01:10:32,453 --> 01:10:35,921
I see. You are certain of this?

901
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,953
Once the Lock of Destiny
is fastened

902
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:48,653
it cannot be undone
in the same lifetime.

903
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:52,685
The only answer...

904
01:10:52,687 --> 01:10:54,854
Is reincarnation.

905
01:10:58,486 --> 01:11:01,686
Escort Su Daji
to the Ruins of Return.

906
01:11:01,688 --> 01:11:04,888
Let her step into the light
and be reborn.

907
01:11:06,688 --> 01:11:08,620
Thank you, Revered Master.

908
01:11:33,254 --> 01:11:34,220
Is this it?

909
01:12:13,154 --> 01:12:14,654
Nine Tailed! Run!

910
01:12:20,553 --> 01:12:22,118
Go without me.

911
01:12:23,888 --> 01:12:24,920
Shen.

912
01:12:28,854 --> 01:12:31,154
- I...
- Just go.

913
01:12:33,154 --> 01:12:34,187
Do what has to be done.

914
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,821
Save her...

915
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:38,854
and come home.

916
01:12:40,387 --> 01:12:41,721
Of course.

917
01:13:42,587 --> 01:13:44,054
Uh...

918
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,552
<i>Don't
you want to be a god?</i>

919
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:54,952
<i>No. Go on.</i>

920
01:13:54,954 --> 01:13:56,952
You've stood by me long enough.

921
01:13:56,954 --> 01:13:58,152
<i>Report back to
the master.</i>

922
01:13:58,154 --> 01:13:59,451
- <i>Ugh.</i>
- Do as I say.

923
01:13:59,453 --> 01:14:01,621
I came here
without his permission...

924
01:14:08,054 --> 01:14:09,451
<i>Jiang Ziya.</i>

925
01:14:09,453 --> 01:14:12,185
<i>I used to be so jealous.</i>

926
01:14:12,187 --> 01:14:14,652
You were the Master's favorite.

927
01:14:14,654 --> 01:14:16,020
<i>Everyone loved you.</i>

928
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:19,853
<i>But I get it now.</i>

929
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:26,220
<i>You didn't become a hero.</i>

930
01:14:28,354 --> 01:14:30,020
<i>You've always been one.</i>

931
01:14:33,654 --> 01:14:34,887
<i>But this time...</i>

932
01:14:35,787 --> 01:14:37,688
<i>it's my turn.</i>

933
01:15:19,054 --> 01:15:20,285
Jiang Ziya.

934
01:15:20,287 --> 01:15:21,454
Yes?

935
01:15:23,087 --> 01:15:24,187
Where are you taking us?

936
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:26,452
To break the lock.

937
01:15:26,454 --> 01:15:28,054
You're going to be reborn.

938
01:15:29,387 --> 01:15:31,454
Reborn as what?

939
01:15:35,454 --> 01:15:37,718
How do you like that?

940
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,987
I'm right back
at where I started.

941
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,187
Empty-handed.

942
01:15:43,787 --> 01:15:47,753
When I opened by eyes
all I could see were ruins.

943
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,454
Whoever I met.

944
01:15:51,254 --> 01:15:52,887
Just wanted to hurt me.

945
01:15:53,621 --> 01:15:55,552
I tried to tell them...

946
01:15:55,554 --> 01:15:57,654
I said I wasn't a Fox Devil.

947
01:16:00,287 --> 01:16:02,087
But they wouldn't believe me.

948
01:16:05,154 --> 01:16:06,851
In the next life

949
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,987
you'll be
a perfectly ordinary child.

950
01:16:10,187 --> 01:16:11,220
With friends.

951
01:16:11,954 --> 01:16:13,918
Family.

952
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,020
A father who loves
and cares for you.

953
01:16:20,454 --> 01:16:21,952
Don't do that.

954
01:16:21,954 --> 01:16:24,751
Don't fill my head with lies.

955
01:16:24,753 --> 01:16:26,687
I'd never do that.

956
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:34,187
Goodbye.

957
01:17:58,987 --> 01:18:00,020
Huh.

958
01:18:28,987 --> 01:18:30,054
Jiang Ziya.

959
01:18:31,054 --> 01:18:31,954
Thank you...

960
01:19:12,388 --> 01:19:13,987
Damn you, Nine Tailed.

961
01:19:16,787 --> 01:19:18,787
Let it be finished!

962
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:49,386
The lock has been broken.

963
01:19:49,388 --> 01:19:51,118
She is no longer bound to you.

964
01:20:10,653 --> 01:20:12,551
Let her...

965
01:20:12,553 --> 01:20:14,120
be reborn!

966
01:20:32,553 --> 01:20:34,155
Reborn?

967
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,853
You're insane!

968
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:51,787
Surely you didn't think
I would release her so easily?

969
01:20:53,155 --> 01:20:54,751
Stop this!

970
01:20:54,753 --> 01:20:56,685
The world must know.

971
01:20:56,687 --> 01:21:00,188
People must see what
the Revered Master has done!

972
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:12,119
Arise, my fox brethren!

973
01:21:16,188 --> 01:21:18,551
Why the hell
is my eye twitching?

974
01:21:18,553 --> 01:21:20,551
I've had two drinks. Maybe.

975
01:21:20,553 --> 01:21:22,385
It's a sign of good fortune!

976
01:21:26,987 --> 01:21:27,920
What the?

977
01:21:54,787 --> 01:21:56,651
Behold.

978
01:21:56,653 --> 01:21:59,551
These are my fox brethren.

979
01:21:59,553 --> 01:22:02,518
Thousands of them!

980
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,221
Why are their souls restless?

981
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:06,584
Years ago

982
01:22:06,586 --> 01:22:08,918
the Master made a promise.

983
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:12,385
He told me I would become a god.

984
01:22:12,387 --> 01:22:14,484
But there was a price.

985
01:22:14,486 --> 01:22:17,352
I had to bind
the Fox Clan to mortals

986
01:22:17,354 --> 01:22:20,987
and launch a war that
would unite the Three Realms.

987
01:22:26,486 --> 01:22:28,286
Little did we know.

988
01:22:28,288 --> 01:22:33,753
When all was said and done
the master reneged our bargain.

989
01:22:34,453 --> 01:22:36,685
He ordered our genocide.

990
01:22:36,687 --> 01:22:40,451
We were thrown
into the bottomless pit.

991
01:22:40,453 --> 01:22:43,019
Never again to see the light.

992
01:22:43,021 --> 01:22:46,451
- Never to be reborn.
- Oh...

993
01:22:46,453 --> 01:22:49,186
We were the true casualties

994
01:22:49,188 --> 01:22:52,088
of the Revered Master's
ultimate war.

995
01:22:53,687 --> 01:22:55,352
I believed him.

996
01:22:55,354 --> 01:22:57,618
In a moment of greed,

997
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:00,053
I doomed my own kind!

998
01:23:04,653 --> 01:23:05,851
This cannot be.

999
01:23:05,853 --> 01:23:06,918
Today,

1000
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,253
the Revered Master
shall know the pain

1001
01:23:09,255 --> 01:23:12,086
he wreaked upon the Fox Clan.

1002
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:17,820
The Three Realms will tremble
at the sight of our true power!

1003
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,055
Ah! Jiu!

1004
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,518
Release me from this prison!

1005
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,787
Kill her!

1006
01:24:25,921 --> 01:24:27,486
Undo the lock.

1007
01:24:30,121 --> 01:24:32,986
Kill her!

1008
01:24:32,988 --> 01:24:34,853
Jiu!

1009
01:24:51,088 --> 01:24:52,988
Whoa! Jiu!

1010
01:25:04,753 --> 01:25:06,586
Revered Master.

1011
01:25:08,553 --> 01:25:11,751
We beg you to reconsider!

1012
01:25:11,753 --> 01:25:15,720
What I do,
I do for the greater good.

1013
01:25:54,421 --> 01:25:57,486
Jiu. I won't.

1014
01:26:37,021 --> 01:26:40,218
As long
as the Lock of Destiny exists,

1015
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:43,052
you cannot save anyone.

1016
01:26:43,054 --> 01:26:44,819
In times to come,

1017
01:26:44,821 --> 01:26:47,888
others will repeat our mistake.

1018
01:27:04,254 --> 01:27:06,052
<i>When I'm reborn,</i>

1019
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:08,754
<i>will I really have a father
who loves me?</i>

1020
01:27:22,854 --> 01:27:25,154
No one
should be denied salvation.

1021
01:27:26,254 --> 01:27:27,919
<i>Not gods.</i>

1022
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:30,919
<i>Not devils. Not mortals.</i>

1023
01:27:30,921 --> 01:27:34,886
<i>We all deserve to live free
from the yoke of oppression.</i>

1024
01:27:34,888 --> 01:27:37,087
<i>We all deserve the truth.</i>

1025
01:27:49,688 --> 01:27:52,018
<i>The lock has been undone.</i>

1026
01:27:55,888 --> 01:27:59,054
Father, Mother.
Can we go home now?

1027
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:22,654
- Save me.
- Release me from this hell.

1028
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:54,854
Jiu!

1029
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,185
Ah...

1030
01:29:03,187 --> 01:29:04,621
Jiang Ziya.

1031
01:29:33,788 --> 01:29:36,020
Have I been reborn yet?

1032
01:31:16,487 --> 01:31:18,519
<i>Don't do that.</i>

1033
01:31:18,521 --> 01:31:20,688
<i>Don't fill my
head with lies.</i>

1034
01:31:37,387 --> 01:31:39,152
Head Disciple Jiang Ziya

1035
01:31:39,154 --> 01:31:42,785
has achieved merit by luring out
and vanquishing

1036
01:31:42,787 --> 01:31:45,218
the Fox Devil once and for all.

1037
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,419
He may now reclaim his place

1038
01:31:47,421 --> 01:31:49,487
as leader of the gods.

1039
01:32:08,587 --> 01:32:11,020
One lock remains to be severed.

1040
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:49,420
I, Jiang Ziya, herby vow
to follow the Master.

1041
01:32:49,422 --> 01:32:50,685
In everything.

1042
01:32:50,687 --> 01:32:53,687
To lead the gods,
and protect all life.

1043
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,420
To become a true god.

1044
01:32:57,422 --> 01:32:59,619
Stand apart.

1045
01:32:59,621 --> 01:33:01,187
Forge your own path.

1046
01:33:04,654 --> 01:33:07,386
The Grand Duke has ascended.

1047
01:33:07,388 --> 01:33:11,252
All deities, fall back.

1048
01:33:11,254 --> 01:33:13,386
Approach, Jiang Ziya.

1049
01:33:13,388 --> 01:33:16,887
Kneel before heaven
to be cleansed and deified.

1050
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:22,521
Kneel!

1051
01:33:26,454 --> 01:33:28,054
Impudence!

1052
01:33:33,321 --> 01:33:35,420
There was no choice.

1053
01:33:35,422 --> 01:33:38,587
The Fox Devil was pure evil.

1054
01:33:42,154 --> 01:33:46,887
Search your heart. My actions
were a gift to the world.

1055
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,785
Henceforth,

1056
01:34:03,787 --> 01:34:05,587
may no one lose their home.

1057
01:34:07,454 --> 01:34:08,554
May no one

1058
01:34:09,154 --> 01:34:10,454
be deceived.

1059
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:13,987
Let injustice...

1060
01:34:18,388 --> 01:34:20,885
be a thing of the past!

1061
01:34:21,987 --> 01:34:25,185
You've gone mad!
If the stairway crumbles,

1062
01:34:25,187 --> 01:34:28,954
the world shall be cut off
from divine protection!

1063
01:34:43,487 --> 01:34:45,120
What have you done?

1064
01:35:26,322 --> 01:35:27,718
And so,

1065
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,785
Jiang Ziya
demolished the Stairway

1066
01:35:30,787 --> 01:35:33,154
and the Revered Master
was punished by Heaven.

1067
01:35:35,087 --> 01:35:36,818
The Swallow descended

1068
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:39,785
and guided restless souls home.

1069
01:35:39,787 --> 01:35:44,452
Once again, the world saw peace
and hope restored.

1070
01:35:44,454 --> 01:35:49,018
When I grow up, I want
to be a hero just like that!

1071
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:52,851
Master. Where does
the Swallow come from?

1072
01:35:52,853 --> 01:35:56,720
Where indeed? A place
far above even Jingxu Hall.

1073
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,785
In the great beyond.

1074
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:02,885
Where your master's
master dwells.

1075
01:36:02,887 --> 01:36:05,954
Wow. So the master's
master is the Revered Master.

1076
01:36:06,987 --> 01:36:09,818
And the Revered Master's
master is...

1077
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:11,353
Great Revered Master!

1078
01:36:11,355 --> 01:36:14,518
Hush!
His name isn't for you to say.

1079
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,718
He is the great deity far above
the Ninth Heaven

1080
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,018
and sends the Swallow to earth.

1081
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,985
Jiang Ziya sure is amazing!

1082
01:36:20,987 --> 01:36:23,551
Even the Great Revered Master
lent him a hand.

1083
01:36:23,553 --> 01:36:26,085
As expected of my "good friend."

1084
01:36:26,087 --> 01:36:29,052
Your good friend?
You can search all of Beihai

1085
01:36:29,054 --> 01:36:32,052
and find no one closer
to Jiang Ziya than me!

1086
01:36:32,054 --> 01:36:33,484
Cut the crap.

1087
01:36:33,486 --> 01:36:35,386
Your only good friend is drink.

1088
01:36:35,388 --> 01:36:38,553
Hard to believe
Beihai is finally at peace.

1089
01:37:01,388 --> 01:37:03,651

What a pretty sound!
I want one for my doll too!

1096
01:37:26,054 --> 01:37:30,119
