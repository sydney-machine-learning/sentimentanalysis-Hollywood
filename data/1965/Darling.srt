1
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:33,958
Well, I do want our readers
to feel that this is really your story

2
00:02:34,058 --> 00:02:36,041
so I thought I'd, perhaps,
ask a few questions

3
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:38,791
and if you just answer them
in your own words.

4
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,708
Yes, I see. All right, ask away.

5
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:44,833
Well, let's start
at the beginning, shall we?

6
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:48,333
Well, I... I had a terribly
ordinary childhood, I'm afraid.

7
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:50,583
Born at an early age and all that.

8
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:53,291
Fell off lots of bicycles,
ate too many cream cakes.

9
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:55,625
A normal childhood, you know.

10
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:58,291
Oh, this is me, age six.

11
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:01,750
Probably a piece of chewing gum stuck
under my hat, only you can't see.

12
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,541
I do remember I was always the sort of
child who got picked on to do things.

13
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:10,458
La-la-la, la-la-la...

14
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,583
What a darling little baby he is!

15
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:15,333
Joseph was actually
my older sister Felicity.

16
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:18,500
I am afraid I told everyone she'd
grown the beard specially for the part.

17
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,240
Felicity, poor thing, was not amused.

18
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,625
You must be very proud of her,
Mrs Carter.

19
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:28,791
She's a darling.

20
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:31,083
She's going to go a long way.

21
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:33,041
You can see that.

22
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:35,949
Yes, I think she is.

23
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,250
This is me, age 20.

24
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,875
I don't know what I was wearing.

25
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:42,833
Terribly Chelsea I thought I was.

26
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:46,157
And, really, I suppose I was
as square as an ice cube with it.

27
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:53,208
- Try that one over there.
- Right you are.

28
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:55,416
- What, me on the telly?
- It won't take a minute.

29
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:57,208
How fascinating.
You must tell me what to do.

30
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:58,833
Could you come this way, please, then?

31
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, yes, I hate convention. You can't
breathe. You have to break away.

32
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,699
But isn't the breakaway of
yesterday the convention of today?

33
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,708
Well, then, you have
to break away again.

34
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,125
Just for the sake of it?
Isn't that conventional?

35
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:13,666
The way young people live today.
I mean in the way...

36
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:17,500
they dress... the way they dance,
the way they talk even...

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,500
That's more conventional than what
they're trying to get away from.

38
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,375
Would you say the way
I dress is conventional?

39
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:25,458
Well, you're dressed in the height
of fashion and your hair is...

40
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:27,916
- Oh, I just wash and curl it.
- It's fine. We'll use that. Very good.

41
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:30,199
What's more conventional than that?

42
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:35,916
How conventional are we
in matters of public taste?

43
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:39,750
The London skyline is constantly
altering and yet young architects...

44
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,125
Thank you so much for letting me
see the finished product.

45
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:45,041
- It's a very good programme.
- You really think so?

46
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:48,333
Mm... I thought I looked ghastly
but it was a super programme.

47
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:51,208
Well, I thought you looked super
and the programme looked ghastly.

48
00:04:51,308 --> 00:04:53,083
What's more, I'm right too.

49
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:58,339
No, I thought you looked
frightfully lean and intelligent.

50
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,041
I am frightfully lean and intelligent.
Not that it helps.

51
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:04,000
Gosh, you must lead
such an interesting life.

52
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,708
Being a professional questioner?

53
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:08,125
Oh, it's better than
being a professional bosom.

54
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,875
What's that?

55
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:12,083
You should try posing
for Bride some time.

56
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:15,407
I did once. Disaster.
A complete disaster.

57
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:19,407
Oh! Is this yours?

58
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:21,958
Why, yes, as a matter of fact it is.

59
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:25,916
This one.

60
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:29,240
- What do you think I am? Go on...
- Oh, my dear...

61
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:37,324
There's so much junk in this car.
I keep on chucking things out...

62
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:40,541
Have an acid drop.

63
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,541
Oh, yes. I'd love one. Thank you.

64
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:45,041
- One... two...
- Ooh, thank you!

65
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:47,574
- ...three...
- Ooh, dear!

66
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:54,750
Well, we... we just sort of
began to meet, you know.

67
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,458
He had tickets for this or he thought
I might be interested in that.

68
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,291
It was really mostly mental
to start with.

69
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:03,500
There was nothing deliberate about it.

70
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,824
We didn't know
what we were doing at all.

71
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:26,916
- Oh, you're a thoroughly rotten shot.
- Thoroughly rotten target.

72
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:29,199
You couldn't hit a dicky bird.

73
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:32,407
Ooh, buried treasure.

74
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:37,824
Heads we do, tails we don't.

75
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,365
We do.

76
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:50,365
Oh, how I'd love to live here.

77
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,500
Well, we'd have to do
an awful lot to it.

78
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,782
We'd have to do everything to it.

79
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:14,157
Yes, you're right.

80
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:20,125
Do you know these cottages
are being carefully rehabilitated?

81
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,208
At great expense.

82
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,750
"And will emerge as unique
cottage-type homes of distinction."

83
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,791
Do you want to live in
a cottage-type home of distinction?

84
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:28,458
I wouldn't mind.

85
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:30,458
With a yellow front door
and a carriage lamp to match?

86
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:33,375
- Absolutely lovely.
- You are ghastly. You don't mean it.

87
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:35,208
I do!

88
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:38,041
- You are a fantastic girl.
- Why?

89
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,324
I don't know. You just are.

90
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:48,166
Oh, it should be so easy
to be happy, shouldn't it?

91
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,958
Should be the easiest thing
in the world.

92
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:53,115
Should be.

93
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,615
I wonder why it isn't.

94
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,824
Maybe it is.

95
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:10,657
Is it all right for Wednesday?

96
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,615
Yes, it's all right for Wednesday.

97
00:08:20,395 --> 00:08:24,916
I hate this furtiveness. It's so corny.

98
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:28,240
- It's ever so embarrassing.
- What do you want to do, then?

99
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:31,824
I don't know.

100
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,032
I do know.

101
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,449
I don't know.

102
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:41,541
I know.

103
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:54,407
Wife.

104
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:57,166
Husband.

105
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:12,250
Come on, darling...

106
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:20,583
Oh, it's so boring.

107
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:21,791
Oh, come on, darling.

108
00:09:21,891 --> 00:09:25,258
You started it. It was your idea that
we learn the language for our holiday.

109
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:29,166
Yes and all we'd ever be able
to say was, "Oh, what a lovely view!"

110
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:31,583
Well, I'm getting on with it.

111
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:34,115
All right, you get on with it.

112
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,208
Of course I loved him dearly.

113
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:40,208
He was one of
the nicest boys in the world.

114
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:43,041
It's just that he was
so desperately immature.

115
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:45,250
Marriage had been
sort of foisted on him.

116
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,041
He just wasn't ready
for the responsibility.

117
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:50,125
He tried nobly but, you know...

118
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:53,208
He hadn't really got the faintest
idea what it was all about.

119
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:01,083
Now, Mr Southgate, you have the
reputation of being something of a...

120
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,333
a lone wolf.

121
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,708
Is this a protest against
the establishment?

122
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:10,958
It's true I have always
preferred to be a mouse, walk by itself,

123
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:15,083
rather than a member
of a group of literary lions

124
00:10:15,183 --> 00:10:19,333
always licking each other,
washing each other behind the ears,

125
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,625
and biting each other.

126
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:24,990
And as you know,
they're behind bars in a cultural zoo.

127
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:30,750
- They won't let you print that.
- Oh, yes they will, if I fight.

128
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,240
- And will you fight?
- He fights.

129
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,541
Er... something else.

130
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:41,458
Now that you've moved down here,
into the country, into virtual isolation...

131
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:46,074
Robert had marvellous tact.
Incredible maturity, sensitivity.

132
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:50,583
He'd got this funny old bloke
spouting his head off. Fascinating.

133
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,865
I'd never met anyone like old Southgate.

134
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:56,375
Suddenly one felt madly "in", you know.

135
00:10:56,475 --> 00:11:01,166
I mean, to think: "This is one of the great
writers of the century and here I am."

136
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:02,699
Well, it was extraordinary.

137
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:08,333
I don't really remember much anyone
said. That wasn't really the thing.

138
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,416
The thing was, they accepted me.

139
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,458
Oh, I'm just dying to read your books.

140
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:15,041
They're mostly out of print.

141
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,958
- Do you mind if I help myself?
- Please do.

142
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:19,625
Thank you.

143
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:21,583
Well, it's been fabulous meeting you.

144
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:24,791
- Are you a truth-teller?
- Yes, I think so.

145
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:27,074
Is she?

146
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:29,125
Well... she is with me.

147
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:32,625
You consider yourself a very lucky man.

148
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,907
Oh, yes, I do.

149
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:39,833
Gosh, that's marvellous.

150
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,166
I'm glad you like it.

151
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:45,532
I'd rather have done it
than written half my stories.

152
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:49,407
Probably only took him
half an hour, you know.

153
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:53,541
I should like you to have it.

154
00:11:53,641 --> 00:11:56,583
- Both of you.
- I couldn't possibly.

155
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,875
- Please.
- It's yours. It belongs to you.

156
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:02,291
I'm 78 years old, more or less.

157
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:06,458
Besides, I'd much rather you left
this place with this under your arm,

158
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:08,907
than that recording of antique birdsong.

159
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:13,157
Thank you.

160
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:15,375
Just one moment please,
I have a call for you.

161
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:17,657
Go ahead, Ipswich.

162
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,708
Estelle?

163
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:23,541
- How are the children?
- Fine.

164
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:25,157
I shall have to stay the night.

165
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:27,458
I'm staying with him actually.

166
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,416
Oh. All right.

167
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,541
So, I'm sorry.
Give them my love, will you?

168
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:34,250
And tell them I'll see them tomorrow.

169
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,574
Mm-hm. Bye.

170
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:43,000
OK, your go now.

171
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,532
Right, I'll get... some money.

172
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:49,625
- Euston 4614.
- Go ahead, Southampton.

173
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:53,166
Hello, Tony? Hello, love.
I'm still in Southampton.

174
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:57,208
- Well, hell, what a bore.
- It's just as much of a bore for me.

175
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:59,961
OK, yes. See you tomorrow,
then. Bye-bye, darling.

176
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:01,685
Bye.

177
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:36,699
Thank you, sir.

178
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,532
Wait till we get these on.

179
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,333
Funny pair, that Mr and Mrs Golden, 409.

180
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:13,416
I suppose... you've done this sort
of thing hundreds of times before.

181
00:15:13,516 --> 00:15:15,416
You're wrong.

182
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,583
I have never.

183
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,865
Not exactly my line either.

184
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:22,657
I just happen to love you.

185
00:15:23,475 --> 00:15:25,657
I told you.

186
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:30,990
It is... real, then.

187
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:35,407
It's the first time I've
felt real for a long time.

188
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:38,375
Me too.

189
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,541
Me one...

190
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:41,824
Me two...

191
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:47,324
Go on.

192
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:57,958
Oh, look. How jazzy!

193
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:01,282
Every three hours
we can call for refreshments.

194
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:05,949
Welcome.

195
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:18,699
The thought of breaking up a family
was absolutely repellent to me.

196
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:21,833
If anyone had told me that
I was doing anything like that

197
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:24,115
I would have been horrified.

198
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:31,615
I have always regarded families
as... well... unbustable, you know?

199
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:16,875
...and there's pictures of Cambridge.

200
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:20,250
A very convenient door
through there, leading to bedroom.

201
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,041
- A picture, reproduction, of clown.
- Glass is cracked.

202
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:29,333
Yes... Mirror with gilt ormolu frame.
One clock, seems to have stopped,

203
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:31,250
but I'm sure it only needs winding.

204
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,625
And through here, of
course, you've got your hall.

205
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:36,583
Er... the gas meter's there.

206
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:40,166
Through there to the kitchen,
three steps up here to the bathroom...

207
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:43,333
Large cupboard, very useful
for leaving one's coats...

208
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:46,166
and then here in the kitchen
we have the gas cooker,

209
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:50,032
which was put in by the last
tenant, so it's relatively new...

210
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,500
Your books have arrived.

211
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,782
And... your records.

212
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:20,657
- Are these yours?
- Yes.

213
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,250
Hello, my darling.

214
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,541
...it doesn't intrude on you
because it's been dead for so long.

215
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:10,750
It has the sort of property of a sort
of beautifully laid-out corpse.

216
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,416
You don't worry about it.
It's always there...

217
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,407
Ooh, darling...

218
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:20,583
Sorry. Are Liz and Willy
on or off at the moment?

219
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:22,500
Oh, I don't know. I have no idea at all.

220
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,541
What shall I put?

221
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:25,958
Just put "With best wishes"
and leave out "to you both".

222
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:32,875
"Luv, Robert and Diana. Kisses."

223
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:39,250
- Happy Christmas, baby.
- Cool Christmas, honey.

224
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,199
Happy Christmas!

225
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:46,750
Darling, two gorgeous Negroes have just
gone upstairs. What's going on up there?

226
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,032
They're having a diplomatic reception.

227
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:53,500
Would you like
to have a diplomatic reception?

228
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,824
What a good idea!

229
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:12,407
I can't get them to go.

230
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:17,541
Well, make them. Force them to go.

231
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:19,000
How?

232
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,541
I don't know.
Can't you force them to go?

233
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:23,541
I don't know half of them.

234
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:27,166
Oh, dear. I just wish they'd
all go away from our little place.

235
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:29,916
Why did we ever have this... party?

236
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:33,782
I don't know. I wish they'd all... go!

237
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,782
Oh... my friends seemed to get on
very well with your friends.

238
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,699
Your friends are so pretty.

239
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:51,032
Yours... so intelligent.

240
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:55,875
I couldn't have been happy
if I'd kept Robert from his children.

241
00:20:55,975 --> 00:21:00,500
I was absolutely insistent, rain
or shine, he went and saw them.

242
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,333
I couldn't have forgiven myself
if he hadn't done that, you see!

243
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:07,166
"I've never really been
the jealous type.

244
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,449
Where the hell have you been?

245
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:13,865
- I told you. To see the children.
- Until this hour?

246
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:19,791
Did you see her?

247
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:22,657
- Her?
- Her.

248
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,333
No.

249
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:28,615
I don't know whether I believe you.

250
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:31,708
What makes you think
she wants to see me?

251
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:33,166
Perhaps you want to see her.

252
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:34,208
Perhaps I do.

253
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:37,407
Well, why don't you tell me if you want to,
if you're still in love with her?

254
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,333
Oh, Lord...

255
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:44,699
Look here. No, listen.

256
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:49,157
I love you. Honestly.

257
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:55,041
- You won't leave me, will you?
- Leave you?

258
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:57,250
God, leave you... If you only...

259
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,166
- If only you knew.
- I'm so...

260
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,916
I'm so frightened sometimes.

261
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:06,625
What do you mean?
What are you frightened of?

262
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,375
Being so happy!

263
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:22,074
Listen, shall we get married?
Get married and finish all this?

264
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:27,291
Oh, darling, I'm so happy as we are.

265
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:29,574
I don't want anything to change.

266
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:33,291
If we got... married,
there'd be so much...

267
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:37,050
bitterness and unhappiness
for everyone, wouldn't there?

268
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,574
Darling...

269
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:17,083
Good evening.

270
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:19,208
An American statesman recently said

271
00:23:19,308 --> 00:23:23,166
that Britain was a country
which had lost pride in itself.

272
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:26,083
Have we so much to
be ashamed of, I wonder?

273
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:27,699
Let's find out.

274
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,907
What are you ashamed of
in Britain today?

275
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:36,083
Well... let's see.
Can't think of nothing.

276
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:37,416
Nothing?

277
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,333
Well, the traffic and that.
You know, it's a bit congested...

278
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:42,625
- All the time...
- And that's the worst thing?

279
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:44,833
Well, some people
don't work hard enough.

280
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:49,375
Well, I work hard in Bristol
for one person, I do it for one person.

281
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:51,583
Her name's Margaret Roberts.
I've got the photograph on me.

282
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:56,291
Well, everyone these days,
wants something for nothing.

283
00:23:56,391 --> 00:24:00,958
They don't want to put anything out for
what they're striving to get out of this.

284
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:05,500
Talking as a Londoner, I think,
in London itself, the amount of...

285
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,500
how rife homosexuality
has become, in London itself.

286
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,416
I would say again, in retrospect,
that a few years back, that...

287
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:15,208
again, two or three years ago,
that you were...

288
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:17,833
very blatantly sort of approached by
different people in different places.

289
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:19,208
- Really?
- Mm-hm...

290
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:22,375
And you do... It does sort of still...
It's still... You say it's worse?

291
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:24,416
I think it's become worse
over a period of time.

292
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:27,032
- But you have to live with it.
- Yes, I suppose so.

293
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:34,791
- Try my London number again, will you?
- What was that number again?

294
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,074
Flaxman, double-two-four-nine.

295
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:56,875
Morphy Richards refrigerator,
gift of Mr Charles Glass...

296
00:24:56,975 --> 00:25:00,125
Number 81!

297
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:03,708
- Here!
- Mr David Courtney-Barnett.

298
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:08,083
Holiday for two in the Bahamas,
gift of Mr Samuel Goldstone...

299
00:25:08,183 --> 00:25:10,333
Number...

300
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:12,083
68!

301
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:16,708
Yes, me! But, I've just come back.

302
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:20,458
Normally I never did charity work.
It's usually terribly draggy.

303
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,449
But, you know, Robert was away and
Miles Brand phoned the same day.

304
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:29,583
After all, he had chosen me
for the Honeyglow Girl.

305
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:30,833
- Hi Miles.
- Hello.

306
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:32,833
Miles didn't mean a thing
in my private life.

307
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:35,708
I didn't attach any importance to it.

308
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:38,125
Still admire yourself
as much as ever, Miles?

309
00:25:38,225 --> 00:25:39,708
Carlotta!

310
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:41,833
How lucky it is you're a man
after your own heart.

311
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:44,666
Darling, I thought
I could smell prussic acid.

312
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:46,083
I put it down to the weather.

313
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:48,750
It must make a change from
putting it down to expenses.

314
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,541
How savage we are tonight.

315
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:52,208
Somebody's husband
gone back to his wife?

316
00:25:52,308 --> 00:25:55,375
If he had, you would have
been there to greet him.

317
00:25:55,475 --> 00:25:57,458
Leftovers aren't really
my diet, my darling...

318
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:00,083
Oh, I thought you were
always on the market.

319
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,083
That remark was young when you were...

320
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:04,916
- Miles. Mr Glass.
- Oh, excuse me.

321
00:26:05,016 --> 00:26:09,375
I suppose the main attraction
really was Charles Glass. You know...

322
00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:11,541
Mr Honeyglow himself.

323
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:15,949
He's a terrible sweetie. Do you know
Charles? Oh, he's a terrible sweetie.

324
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:17,875
82.

325
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:19,859
82.

326
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:27,041
Sean, my dear fellow.
I hear you're making a new movie.

327
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:28,375
How the hell do you know that?

328
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:31,750
I take a great interest in
your squalid career. I have to.

329
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,500
If you're shooting full-length epics, you
won't want to do ads for the Glass group.

330
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,083
Oh? Says who?

331
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:42,125
A lie can be shot with integrity, just like
anything else. Who's the crumpet?

332
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,449
- Most kind. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

333
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:52,166
- Congratulations.
- Now, ladies and gentlemen...

334
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:56,416
A few words from the president of the
charity we've been assisting tonight.

335
00:26:56,516 --> 00:27:00,875
Pray, silence for
the Right Honourable Basil Willett MP.

336
00:27:00,975 --> 00:27:03,990
A man of few words
and all of them long ones.

337
00:27:04,975 --> 00:27:06,833
Oh, you were splendid, Diana.

338
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,958
I want you to meet Sean Martin.

339
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:10,166
This is Miss Diana Scott.

340
00:27:10,266 --> 00:27:11,833
- Hello.
- How do you do?

341
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:14,666
Would Mr Glass say a few words?

342
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,125
I doubt it, but I'll ask him.
Would you excuse me?

343
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:19,666
I want to say just this...

344
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:22,291
that no matter how much public money,

345
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:26,958
we, the government,
devote to good causes,

346
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:29,333
there will always be a place

347
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:35,041
for private generosity like yours,
ladies and gentlemen, tonight.

348
00:27:35,141 --> 00:27:36,250
Hear, hear.

349
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,291
Never have I seen so many hearts
so obviously in the right place.

350
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:42,875
Hear, hear.

351
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm sure I have no need
to bring to your attention

352
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,208
the plight of our brothers

353
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:53,291
of every creed, race, and colour

354
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:56,541
in every far-flung corner of the earth,

355
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,000
who, at this very moment,
are suffering the...

356
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,916
the humiliation, degradation, shame...

357
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,199
of the agonies of malnutrition.

358
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:10,833
Well, of course I'd love
to make a film someday.

359
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:13,875
So much is important,
the right director, the right script...

360
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:17,708
Oh, you think a good director
makes a difference, do you?

361
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:19,574
Well, it has been known.

362
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:23,458
Oh. This is my wife Sybil. Diana Scott.

363
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:26,157
- Hello.
- Hello.

364
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,000
I think you managed that
very well indeed.

365
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,250
- Ah...
- Oh, here she is. Diana.

366
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,500
I was afraid you'd walked out in
protest against my speechifying.

367
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,625
Oh, not at all.

368
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:43,125
They're got something for us upstairs.
Crisps and Pepsi Cola.

369
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:45,291
I am afraid I haven't seen
one of your pictures.

370
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,625
So little time when one's
in politics to do anything

371
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,083
except try and stay in.

372
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:52,708
Someone said that Brooks-Romford
lost £27,000 last week...

373
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:54,666
Actually, it's an exaggeration.

374
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:55,625
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

375
00:28:55,725 --> 00:28:58,333
- It was only 21,000.
- Oh, is that all?

376
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:00,083
Miles, how are you?

377
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:02,458
Well, Your Grace. And you?

378
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,250
Absolutely splendid.

379
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,532
I'm delighted.

380
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,000
It was said of her great-grandmother
that the only members of the cabinet

381
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,500
who weren't her lovers,
were the ones who had reason to believe

382
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,661
they might be her father.

383
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:17,083
Poor Elspeth.
She's got a lot to live up to.

384
00:29:17,183 --> 00:29:19,333
Well, if it isn't the Lord Grant.

385
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:22,157
My dear Miles.

386
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:28,333
I like your black boys, John. I suppose
I can't wrap one up and take him home.

387
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,666
I wouldn't advise you to try.

388
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:33,250
They're all numbered, Alex. I wouldn't try
and change your luck, if I were you.

389
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,416
- Everything's laid on...
- Now would you like to see the library?

390
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:38,583
Only one way to preserve
a library, these days,

391
00:29:38,683 --> 00:29:41,324
and that's to build
a gambling hall around it.

392
00:29:52,183 --> 00:29:57,625
"This royal throne of kings,
this sceptred isle,

393
00:29:57,725 --> 00:30:02,875
"This earth of majesty,
this seat of Mars,

394
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:07,500
"This other Eden, demi-paradise,

395
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,865
"This fortress built
by Nature for herself

396
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:18,083
"Against infection and the hand of war

397
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,916
"This happy breed of men

398
00:30:21,016 --> 00:30:23,041
"This little world

399
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:26,708
"This precious stone set in a silver sea

400
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:29,166
"Which serves it in the office of a wall

401
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:32,541
"Or as a moat defensive to a house

402
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:38,208
"Against the envy of less happier lands

403
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:43,750
"This blessed plot,
this earth, this realm...

404
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,500
"...this England"

405
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,125
Faites vos jeux.

406
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:51,615
Rien va plus.

407
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,574
Vingt-deux noir. Paire et passe.

408
00:31:09,141 --> 00:31:11,583
Cent, deux cents, trois cents...
Trois cents cinquante livres.

409
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:14,990
Voilà, madame. Trois cents cinquante
livres pour le vingt-deux.

410
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:23,490
That's the Glass house.

411
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:31,666
What's this supposed to be?

412
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,333
It's known in the group as

413
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:37,666
Three Couples Taking their
Pleasures with a Fourth Looking On.

414
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:40,041
Charming.

415
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:42,115
Won't it be locked?

416
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:44,666
One has a key.

417
00:31:44,766 --> 00:31:46,699
One would.

418
00:32:17,808 --> 00:32:19,125
Is this you?

419
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:21,407
My secretary.

420
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:31,250
Do you go winter-sporting?

421
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,375
Yes I do. Do you?

422
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:37,699
No. I don't do anything.

423
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:43,375
What is it?

424
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:47,199
Do you have parents?
I can't imagine you with parents.

425
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:50,199
Yes I have.

426
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:52,958
Two of them.

427
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:55,250
Imagine if...

428
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,875
- What?
- ...it took three.

429
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,375
Took three?

430
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:02,500
Sexes to make a child.

431
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,782
Very entertaining.

432
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,916
Everything would be different.

433
00:33:07,016 --> 00:33:09,824
Quite different with three sexes.

434
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,365
Haven't we got enough problems with two?

435
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:22,000
Is this where
the Glass millions are stored?

436
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,166
Millions? No.

437
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:28,125
Oh. Don't tell me it only contains
a pint of milk and a book of stamps.

438
00:33:28,225 --> 00:33:32,833
- Leave me my illusions, please.
- It's mainly papers.

439
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,074
- Important papers?
- Very.

440
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,666
Do open it, I should love
to see an important paper!

441
00:33:42,766 --> 00:33:44,949
I never have.

442
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:48,458
Wouldn't you?

443
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:50,740
Under any circumstances?

444
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,791
If someone made it worth your while.

445
00:33:56,891 --> 00:33:59,032
Really worth your while.

446
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,490
Have you ever been afraid?

447
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:08,574
Really afraid?

448
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,166
What's an important paper about?

449
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,449
All sorts of things.

450
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:25,708
People you are about to take over?

451
00:34:25,808 --> 00:34:27,000
It could be.

452
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,916
People we're interested in,
for one reason or another.

453
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:35,458
Don't people know when
you're interested in them?

454
00:34:35,558 --> 00:34:38,240
They know. Sometimes.

455
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:40,791
Well, then...

456
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:44,041
But they don't know how interested.

457
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:45,740
No. I suppose not.

458
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:49,458
That's not so easy to tell, I suppose.

459
00:34:49,558 --> 00:34:51,740
No, one hopes not.

460
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:58,699
I wish you'd open up.

461
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:02,199
I can't do that.

462
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:14,708
Sorry!

463
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:15,791
What for?

464
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:18,000
Oh, I just seem to be leaving
most of your tyres on the road.

465
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,282
Enjoy yourself with the compliments
of the Glass Organization.

466
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,083
Don't you possess anything of your own?

467
00:35:26,183 --> 00:35:28,365
Only the things I can't replace.

468
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,541
Of course I told Robert about Miles.

469
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:40,416
It didn't mean anything, after all,

470
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:43,791
but I was always, always
absolutely honest with Robert.

471
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,333
I just had to be.

472
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:48,375
And heavens... Well, there's nothing
wrong with somebody helping you

473
00:35:48,475 --> 00:35:50,407
with your career, after all, is there?

474
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,708
Miles was just madly helpful.

475
00:35:53,808 --> 00:35:55,907
He knew absolutely everyone.

476
00:35:56,975 --> 00:36:00,199
He was just so madly helpful,
that's all.

477
00:36:05,475 --> 00:36:08,958
Well, we just wanted
to have a look at you.

478
00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:11,574
Yes, we just want to take a look at you.

479
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,990
Well, have a look.

480
00:36:16,516 --> 00:36:19,208
Would you look toward the street?

481
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:22,532
That's right. Now the door.

482
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,750
That's right. Now,
I want you to look at me,

483
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:33,074
but keep your neck the same angle.

484
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:37,365
Well, what do you think?

485
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,375
She's all right. She's fine. Fine.

486
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:43,125
Has she enough profile?

487
00:36:43,225 --> 00:36:46,240
Yes, sure. She'll be
standing up most of the time.

488
00:36:47,266 --> 00:36:50,041
Excuse me, but I don't even
know what the film is called.

489
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,375
Jacqueline.

490
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:54,000
Oh, the book?

491
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,074
- Yes.
- What part would it be?

492
00:36:57,183 --> 00:36:58,583
Jacqueline.

493
00:37:27,475 --> 00:37:30,699
So much for me. That's me lot.

494
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:32,416
What?

495
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,583
There was a bit at the end when
I was picked up by the ambulance,

496
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:36,865
but that's been cut.

497
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,148
Tough!

498
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:45,466
From now on it's just about
who did me and why?

499
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:55,657
You two men go round the back.
You others stay here with me.

500
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,125
Yes?

501
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:09,083
My name's Malcolm. Inspector Malcolm.

502
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:12,041
Yes. We've been expecting you...

503
00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:13,782
This way, please.

504
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:18,125
Phew. Oh...

505
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:19,916
What a party.

506
00:38:20,016 --> 00:38:21,875
What a wake.

507
00:38:21,975 --> 00:38:25,083
What a bunch of zombies.

508
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:27,333
Did you hate the movie?

509
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:29,375
Or didn't you? You didn't say you did.

510
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:30,666
Well, I did.

511
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,291
- You didn't.
- All right, I didn't.

512
00:38:32,391 --> 00:38:34,000
You did!

513
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,208
Well, I must say. I've never
been so insulted in all me days.

514
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:41,157
Me first title role.

515
00:38:48,558 --> 00:38:50,750
Robert, what did you think of Miles?

516
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,708
Absolutely crazy about him.

517
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:55,166
Seriously, what did you?

518
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,949
Well, what can I say?

519
00:38:58,141 --> 00:39:01,199
- You think I've been a fool?
- No. People do what they want to.

520
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:05,490
- You are jealous.
- Who knows what I am?

521
00:39:06,558 --> 00:39:08,532
Well, you're the one I bed with.

522
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,708
At present.

523
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:13,375
I hate you. What a thing to say?

524
00:39:13,475 --> 00:39:16,699
What do you want me to say?
We both know what you're up to.

525
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,532
Don't be jealous. There's no need.

526
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:30,740
No?

527
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:35,541
Anyway, this is the finish.

528
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:38,375
- Of what?
- Me and showbiz...

529
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:40,032
Oh, why?

530
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:46,407
Well, it so happens, I'm pregnant.

531
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:52,699
Are you angry?

532
00:39:57,058 --> 00:39:58,532
Are you pleased?

533
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,032
I'm pleased.

534
00:40:05,308 --> 00:40:07,907
You should have told me
sooner, I'd have carried you.

535
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,083
- I can't hear anything ticking.
- You won't for some months.

536
00:40:13,183 --> 00:40:16,407
- Yes, I know that.
- Yes, you would.

537
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,500
Are you pleased?

538
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,782
If you are.

539
00:40:22,975 --> 00:40:24,875
What shall we call it?

540
00:40:24,975 --> 00:40:27,907
- Jacqueline.
- Oh, but of course! Jacqueline!

541
00:40:41,808 --> 00:40:43,250
Shall I wear it to
Pat and Marjorie's tomorrow?

542
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,166
Darling, it's much too soon for that.

543
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:46,875
Oh, yes. Just for a giggle.

544
00:40:46,975 --> 00:40:49,199
Please, I'll have this.

545
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,365
I hadn't really thought about
what it meant, you know.

546
00:40:56,141 --> 00:41:02,041
It seemed lovely, then I realised it was
going to be the ruination of my career.

547
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:06,625
Messing up people's lives,
you know. Mine, Robert's, everybody's.

548
00:41:06,725 --> 00:41:09,583
I just began to realise
I couldn't go through with it.

549
00:41:09,683 --> 00:41:12,458
Heather was lovely.
She was terribly nice.

550
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:13,916
Because, you know, she...

551
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:16,916
she'd had a miscarriage
herself recently and...

552
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,240
she sort of knew the ropes and that.

553
00:41:21,808 --> 00:41:25,250
Oh, thank you.
If you could be here on Friday at 11,

554
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,791
that would be best.

555
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:30,532
Bring overnight things, and, oh... skip
breakfast that morning, will you?

556
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:33,615
Thank you.

557
00:41:43,183 --> 00:41:45,365
How do you feel?

558
00:41:46,308 --> 00:41:49,532
I never want anything
to do with sex again as long as I live.

559
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,699
Well?

560
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,949
How do you feel?

561
00:42:11,891 --> 00:42:13,449
Empty.

562
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,958
- When are they going to let you out?
- Anytime.

563
00:42:22,058 --> 00:42:26,208
They've got lots of eager ladies.
They're queuing for the bed, it seems.

564
00:42:26,308 --> 00:42:27,782
I can believe that.

565
00:42:30,516 --> 00:42:32,240
I'm not going back to the flat.

566
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,782
- I see.
- You don't, but it doesn't matter.

567
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:43,375
All right, I don't.

568
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:47,907
My sister came to see me.
I'm going down there.

569
00:42:48,641 --> 00:42:51,574
The country...

570
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:57,449
- I want you to decide...
- Don't touch me.

571
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:03,032
- I just wish that...
- It's no good wishing.

572
00:43:05,725 --> 00:43:06,782
No...

573
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,865
I'll probably stay
at the flat for a bit.

574
00:43:13,141 --> 00:43:14,865
If you want me, that's where I'll be.

575
00:43:16,141 --> 00:43:20,041
- Don't forget to feed the fishes.
- Mm-hm.

576
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:23,240
Poor little things.

577
00:43:39,975 --> 00:43:45,375
- Bang! Bang! You're dead!
- Oh...! Oh...!

578
00:43:45,475 --> 00:43:47,449
Are you really dead?

579
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:51,791
- Dead-ing...
- Oh, you'll never catch me.

580
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:55,000
I've got "Trouble at No. 10", darling.
What have you got?

581
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,990
- I've got "Morality and the test tube".
- Nasty.

582
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:03,490
Don't point guns, William.
I've told you about that before.

583
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:10,865
- I don't want her to get too tired, Alec.
- No.

584
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,375
Come on, William, that's
enough. Leave Auntie Diana alone.

585
00:44:14,475 --> 00:44:16,166
Come on, darling, don't be tiresome.

586
00:44:16,266 --> 00:44:19,490
Come on. Come and sit down
here and play with your comics.

587
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:25,250
Darling, come and sit down. We don't want
to get you tired out. Come and relax.

588
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,532
Have a comic.

589
00:44:29,183 --> 00:44:32,125
Pity you missed the daffodils.
They were absolutely lovely.

590
00:44:32,225 --> 00:44:34,500
- Would you like crispy?
- Just a bit, Alec.

591
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,907
But no fat.

592
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:39,041
Here you are, Ivor.

593
00:44:39,141 --> 00:44:40,875
You've changed your hairstyle, Felicity.

594
00:44:40,975 --> 00:44:45,125
You like it? It's a Hungarian
refugee who does it nicely.

595
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:46,875
Gives it volume, which is what I like.

596
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,291
Do start. Rupert,
don't stand on ceremony.

597
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:52,666
- That's yours.
- Thank you.

598
00:44:52,766 --> 00:44:54,958
The lawn looks good, Alec.
How do you do it?

599
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:56,333
Oh, it's that new Stay Green.

600
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:58,750
What about that plastic sprinkler
I recommended?

601
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,750
Useless. Couldn't
get the stuff through the holes.

602
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:02,208
Oh, really, I'm awfully sorry.

603
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:04,958
This is going to be one of those
frightful gardening conversations.

604
00:45:05,058 --> 00:45:07,500
I know it's therapeutic, Ivor,
but you really must stop.

605
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,333
Oh, all right.

606
00:45:10,433 --> 00:45:12,375
Saw your film at our local fleapit.

607
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:14,041
- Yes?
- Sorry not to see more of you.

608
00:45:14,141 --> 00:45:17,625
- Unfortunately, we missed the beginning.
- Best part. You were stunning.

609
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:19,916
Ooh... Liked my black lingerie, did you?

610
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,375
Ivor's been after to me to buy some.

611
00:45:23,475 --> 00:45:25,250
Really, Helen, is nothing sacred?

612
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,293
Not much.

613
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,750
See what you do to our suburban
morals, your type of picture?

614
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,958
No, honestly, you were jolly good.

615
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:34,500
- Thank you.
- Er...

616
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,208
Rupert makes films too, you know.

617
00:45:36,308 --> 00:45:37,750
Oh, how fascinating.

618
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,166
Honestly, Felicity, I thought
we'd made a solemn pact.

619
00:45:40,266 --> 00:45:41,708
No, you must tell me all about it.

620
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:44,375
Well, it's something I had to do
with the War House, actually.

621
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,208
- A training film.
- Oh, a training film?

622
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:49,916
Mm. Erm...
How to Service An Armoured Car.

623
00:45:50,016 --> 00:45:52,865
Oh, a star vehicle, no less.

624
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:55,500
- Oh, no...
- I hadn't thought of that.

625
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,458
Nothing like yours, of course.

626
00:45:57,558 --> 00:45:58,750
Can I have the horseradish...

627
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,157
- Alec, may I have the horseradish?
- Mummy!

628
00:46:03,058 --> 00:46:04,708
Whatever are you doing up at this hour?

629
00:46:04,808 --> 00:46:06,625
I haven't had my chocolate or anything.

630
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:10,000
Oh, really, William.
You are being so boring, darling.

631
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,416
We discussed all of this...

632
00:46:11,516 --> 00:46:14,333
- But I haven't had my chocolate...
- Don't start your snivelling...

633
00:46:14,433 --> 00:46:17,041
Don't worry, Felicity.
I'll find him his chocolate.

634
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:20,125
Oh, would you, Di, darling?
Thank you so much.

635
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:24,291
Well, see... She's absolutely brilliant
with children. Quite, quite marvellous.

636
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:26,824
I...I do apologise. I'm so sorry.

637
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:34,583
What was actually wrong
with Diana's original husband?

638
00:46:34,683 --> 00:46:36,500
Tony Bridges?

639
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,333
Oh... too young.

640
00:46:38,433 --> 00:46:40,041
Rupert's the right age.

641
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:42,000
And steady.

642
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,282
Bridges was steady.

643
00:46:44,975 --> 00:46:47,708
Yes, but he was too young.

644
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:51,032
- Rupert's the right age.
- Yes...

645
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:53,500
Do you think he...

646
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,291
Oh, I think he did, yes.

647
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:59,240
- Do you think she...
- I think she did, yes.

648
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,591
Alec, you've got your elbow somehow...

649
00:47:05,691 --> 00:47:09,699
I wasn't aware of it. Sorry, dear.

650
00:47:10,475 --> 00:47:14,041
What I shall never understand is,
how you and she...

651
00:47:14,141 --> 00:47:16,750
Same parents, same background...

652
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,833
Yes, I know. It is odd.

653
00:47:19,933 --> 00:47:23,500
This chap of hers, in London.
Is that all finished now?

654
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,916
Oh, yes. No question of that at all.

655
00:47:26,016 --> 00:47:27,990
Completely finished.

656
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:38,949
I'm back!

657
00:47:44,808 --> 00:47:46,708
- Like that?
- I had to.

658
00:47:46,808 --> 00:47:49,333
It was so boring I could have screamed!

659
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,500
You mean you came on
the train dressed like that?

660
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,333
No-one noticed.

661
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:55,615
What a funny girl.

662
00:48:05,558 --> 00:48:09,041
One day I will have to
bail you out of clink

663
00:48:09,141 --> 00:48:11,083
for indecent exposure.

664
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:15,449
- Would you?
- Of course I would.

665
00:49:35,516 --> 00:49:37,291
Want some coffee?

666
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,949
You know I don't want to.

667
00:49:40,016 --> 00:49:42,824
Sorry. Sorry I spoke.

668
00:49:46,308 --> 00:49:48,490
Would you rather
I went up to the office and worked?

669
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,583
I don't know...

670
00:49:51,683 --> 00:49:54,250
There's something about a typewriter.

671
00:49:54,694 --> 00:49:56,732
Well... I'm sorry.

672
00:50:00,558 --> 00:50:02,041
Here, wait...

673
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:04,699
Come on...

674
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,666
Look, why don't you go and do something?

675
00:50:08,766 --> 00:50:11,000
Try that audition.
It's your sort of thing. Go on.

676
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,750
Just go and have a go.

677
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,708
Take the car... and don't crash it.

678
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:19,032
Sì, signor. Grazie, signor.

679
00:50:21,558 --> 00:50:25,791
I want to dance. I want to dance.
That's what you'll never understand.

680
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:28,074
I don't want to think, I want to dance.

681
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:33,166
- Your name, please.
- Diana Scott.

682
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:35,458
Diana Scott.

683
00:50:35,558 --> 00:50:38,083
- Would you like to wait over there?
- Right.

684
00:50:38,183 --> 00:50:40,750
Tell me about yourself.
What you've been up to recently?

685
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,791
Well, I've done six months
at Bournemouth Rep,

686
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:44,166
playing leads and things.

687
00:50:44,266 --> 00:50:49,333
Some television: Z-Cars, A vengers.
A season at Worthing Rep.

688
00:50:49,433 --> 00:50:51,666
A couple of Edgar Wallaces
at Merton Park.

689
00:50:51,766 --> 00:50:54,625
Cheers. That's fine. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

690
00:50:54,725 --> 00:50:57,625
- Thank you.
- Next please.

691
00:50:59,183 --> 00:51:02,407
Er... Miss Joy Green, please.

692
00:51:06,808 --> 00:51:09,000
Miss Joy Green, thank you.

693
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,791
- Miss Green...
- Yes?

694
00:51:10,891 --> 00:51:15,208
- You've got a speech there.
- Yes. Yes, I have.

695
00:51:15,308 --> 00:51:18,500
- Right, in your own time, then.
- Right, thank you.

696
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,833
- I want to dance.
- Louder.

697
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:22,500
I want to dance!

698
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,500
That's what you'll never understand.

699
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,416
I don't want to think.

700
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,490
I want to dance!

701
00:51:35,183 --> 00:51:37,583
- Hey. That's my meter.
- Sorry.

702
00:51:37,683 --> 00:51:40,666
I should think you are sorry.
Go on, get out of it.

703
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,949
Women drivers.

704
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,500
Grand passe. Once more.

705
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,500
Grand. Once again.

706
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,324
Un. Vite. Un.

707
00:52:09,183 --> 00:52:11,500
Well, look who's here.

708
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,041
Your secretary told me you'd be here.

709
00:52:13,141 --> 00:52:15,750
- Hope you don't mind.
- Mind? Not at all.

710
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,750
How are things?

711
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,199
Flat.

712
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:23,407
- Skol.
- Skol.

713
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:41,416
Nice place. Had it long?

714
00:52:41,516 --> 00:52:43,583
Not too long. It's convenient.

715
00:52:43,683 --> 00:52:47,250
The firm owns it.
It came to us by mistake.

716
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,532
Nice mistake.

717
00:52:51,141 --> 00:52:54,125
One tries to see
that one's mistakes usually are.

718
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:23,958
I always feel as if there's
one more corner to turn.

719
00:53:24,058 --> 00:53:27,865
- And I'll be there.
- And so you will.

720
00:53:28,391 --> 00:53:30,615
And there'll be another.

721
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,365
That's the attraction of corners.

722
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:39,240
I do love Robert, you know.

723
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:42,157
Why not?

724
00:54:25,558 --> 00:54:28,000
My goodness, what a bit of luck.

725
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,625
What a clever girl.

726
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,074
My lucky day.

727
00:54:43,016 --> 00:54:44,375
What the hell are you doing?

728
00:54:44,475 --> 00:54:46,791
What the hell am I doing?

729
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:49,041
Sitting in the dark.

730
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:50,833
Admiring the view.

731
00:54:50,933 --> 00:54:53,958
Well... good for you.

732
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:56,916
Sorry I was so late.
The car got towed away.

733
00:54:57,016 --> 00:54:58,916
Did it?

734
00:54:59,016 --> 00:55:02,625
Bloody meters.
Had to go miles to get it back.

735
00:55:02,725 --> 00:55:04,333
Poor you.

736
00:55:04,433 --> 00:55:07,250
I would have been back sooner,
if it hadn't been for that.

737
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:09,532
Where'd you have to go?

738
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:12,000
I don't know.

739
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,125
Taxi took me. I just know it took hours.

740
00:55:15,225 --> 00:55:16,583
Did you have to pay?

741
00:55:16,683 --> 00:55:18,875
I mean, to get it out.

742
00:55:18,975 --> 00:55:21,990
Of course. You always have
to pay to get a car out, don't you?

743
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:24,532
What sort of day have you had?

744
00:55:27,225 --> 00:55:28,782
Quiet.

745
00:55:30,266 --> 00:55:32,166
What kept you?

746
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:33,916
I told you. I had to get the car out...

747
00:55:34,016 --> 00:55:36,824
I mean, so that you overshot the meter.

748
00:55:38,766 --> 00:55:40,375
well...

749
00:55:40,475 --> 00:55:43,750
I didn't go to my audition.
I went to my agent instead.

750
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:47,074
And I think I've got
a job coming up in Paris soon.

751
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:00,074
- What's that for?
- Getting the car out.

752
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:05,824
Where would I be without you?

753
00:56:21,016 --> 00:56:22,625
Of course, Miles was the perfect guide

754
00:56:22,725 --> 00:56:25,500
because he knew Paris
on every possible level.

755
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,458
You know, the tourist level.

756
00:56:27,558 --> 00:56:30,990
And then he could take one inside and
show one how sophisticated people live.

757
00:56:37,016 --> 00:56:40,083
Oh, we went to
a fabulous wedding, I remember.

758
00:56:40,183 --> 00:56:43,416
Chloe Kalman, the film actress
had remarried Toto Damiano.

759
00:56:43,516 --> 00:56:45,416
You know, the American manganese heir.

760
00:56:45,516 --> 00:56:48,916
And afterwards we went on to
the most extraordinary place with them.

761
00:56:49,016 --> 00:56:50,791
They're astonishing people.

762
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:55,583
Terribly sophisticated and sort of
emotionally inquisitive,

763
00:56:55,683 --> 00:56:57,708
which is a marvellous thing really.

764
00:56:57,808 --> 00:57:00,458
Mon petit Miles. C'est bon te voir...

765
00:57:00,558 --> 00:57:02,041
- Comment ça va?
- Ça va bien et vous?

766
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:04,750
- Et la petite?
- Mademoiselle Diana Scott.

767
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:06,041
- Are you English?
- Yes?

768
00:57:06,141 --> 00:57:09,000
Oh, she's beautiful.
She lives in England?

769
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,291
- Yes.
- Yes?

770
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:13,615
Bah, écoutez, entrez. Venez boire
du champagne. Allez!

771
00:57:15,058 --> 00:57:18,166
- A la vôtre...
- N'oubliez pas la petite.

772
00:57:18,266 --> 00:57:22,750
- A1ors, ici... A 1a vôtre aussi.
- A la vôtre aussi.

773
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,708
Alors, je vous laisse tous
maintenant. Je m'en vais.

774
00:57:25,808 --> 00:57:28,666
- And... how are you?
- OK.

775
00:57:28,766 --> 00:57:30,416
Santé!

776
00:57:30,516 --> 00:57:31,250
Santé.

777
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:34,500
Make yourself comfortable.
The young man is late. I don't know why

778
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,824
Et vous autres, je vous
l'enverrai dès qu'il arrive.

779
00:57:39,308 --> 00:57:41,291
Billie...

780
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:44,958
One of yours?
I thought I recognised the rubies.

781
00:57:45,058 --> 00:57:46,208
You're improving.

782
00:57:46,308 --> 00:57:48,916
Oh, Miles, I love you. You're such a...

783
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:54,166
Oh, Billie. If I didn't know you
were a man, I'd be very shocked.

784
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:57,907
Diana, darling. I want you
to meet Billie Castiglione.

785
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,833
He's one of
the best sculptresses in Paris.

786
00:58:00,933 --> 00:58:02,750
He's dying to do your bust.

787
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:06,416
I'm going to kill that man, I am.

788
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:10,708
You've got a beautiful head.
Wonderful bones. Truly.

789
00:58:10,808 --> 00:58:12,125
Thank you.

790
00:58:12,225 --> 00:58:14,907
Madames, Messieurs,
s'il vous plaît, asseyez-vous.

791
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:25,824
Fumez si vous voulez.
Faites comme chez vous.

792
00:58:28,266 --> 00:58:29,208
Voulez-vous une cigarette?

793
00:58:29,308 --> 00:58:32,532
Oh, merci.
Je fume seu1ement des mentho1s.

794
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:40,324
It's very hot in here.

795
00:58:43,808 --> 00:58:44,699
Merci.

796
00:58:46,058 --> 00:58:48,699
She's got an interesting head.

797
00:59:05,016 --> 00:59:08,657
Ce jeune homme arrive dans
quelques minutes, je suis sure...

798
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:21,375
Entrez! Voilà. Finalement.

799
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:24,375
Je suis navré, j'ai du retard,
mais le trafic était épouvantable.

800
00:59:24,475 --> 00:59:26,166
Vous savez que ça fait un
moment que nous attendons.

801
00:59:26,266 --> 00:59:29,041
Je m'excuse mais, c'est vraiment
impossible de parquer la voiture.

802
00:59:29,141 --> 00:59:30,750
Nulle part...

803
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:34,166
C'est affreux de parquer. Ça fait
une demi-heure dans la rue en bas...

804
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:36,907
C'est partout.

805
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:15,500
Dis donc, on commence à s'ennuyer ici.

806
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,125
Si on jouait au jeu?

807
01:00:17,225 --> 01:00:21,074
Mais si, un peu de home movies!
Allez. Vous allez voir, c'est marrant.

808
01:00:29,891 --> 01:00:32,500
Mes amis, nous allons jouer
la spécialité de la maison.

809
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,500
Qu'est-ce que c'est?

810
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,824
Bien, c'est une espèce de
cinéma vérité un peu existentiel.

811
01:00:38,516 --> 01:00:40,958
Tu veux jouer aussi?

812
01:00:41,058 --> 01:00:43,500
André. The music, please!

813
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,416
This is going to be fun.

814
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:46,833
What is it?

815
01:00:46,933 --> 01:00:50,875
Well, it's a...
kind of a truth game, sort of.

816
01:00:50,975 --> 01:00:53,083
Come. You'll play with me.

817
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:55,291
Oh, no. I don't know how to do this.

818
01:00:55,391 --> 01:00:58,875
Oh, you mustn't be shy.
Everybody's doing it.

819
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:02,657
Get up with me.
You don't have to be nervous.

820
01:01:07,728 --> 01:01:11,490
When the music stops
the cradle will rock.

821
01:02:06,058 --> 01:02:09,240
- Stop the music.
- Pausez-la. Pausez-la.

822
01:02:14,558 --> 01:02:17,907
Why, Diana Scott. How you've changed!

823
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:23,833
Why, darling. It's only because
I've had a little too much sunray.

824
01:02:26,266 --> 01:02:28,875
I don't understand.
Is he pretending to be me?

825
01:02:28,975 --> 01:02:31,291
You're home and dry.

826
01:02:31,391 --> 01:02:33,625
Combien de fois?

827
01:02:33,725 --> 01:02:35,666
I don't understand francais?

828
01:02:35,766 --> 01:02:37,625
How many times?

829
01:02:37,725 --> 01:02:43,083
Look, will you relax? Relax.
Don't be frightened, it's fun.

830
01:02:43,183 --> 01:02:46,500
Will you come on a cruise with me to...

831
01:02:47,204 --> 01:02:52,000
Only if I have the top bed.

832
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,375
What would you do
to be in my next film, Diana?

833
01:02:55,475 --> 01:02:59,083
I don't know the name for it,
but I'll definitely do it.

834
01:03:02,225 --> 01:03:04,166
Why is he doing this?

835
01:03:04,266 --> 01:03:06,949
- It's fun.
- Recommencez la musique.

836
01:04:11,225 --> 01:04:12,875
Miles.

837
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:16,099
My dear fellow, I'd know you anywhere.

838
01:04:16,766 --> 01:04:19,500
Tell me, do you love Diana?

839
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,250
- No.
- Is she good in bed, Miles?

840
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,291
I haven't noticed.

841
01:04:24,391 --> 01:04:26,458
I am.

842
01:04:26,558 --> 01:04:27,532
Bravo!

843
01:04:28,016 --> 01:04:30,291
Does she love you?

844
01:04:30,391 --> 01:04:34,958
Like a prisoner loves a jailer,
cause I carry a big bunch of keys.

845
01:04:35,058 --> 01:04:36,791
Oh, shut up.

846
01:04:36,891 --> 01:04:39,375
Oh, blimey...

847
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:42,574
Miles, my love, have
you ever been in love?

848
01:04:44,016 --> 01:04:49,125
Yes... for as long as
I can remember. With myself.

849
01:04:49,225 --> 01:04:51,291
Touché.

850
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:53,500
Olé!

851
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,166
Tell me, Miles.
If you could be anything in the world,

852
01:04:57,266 --> 01:04:59,375
what would you most want to be?

853
01:04:59,475 --> 01:05:03,166
- Molto divertente.
- A pimp in a royal whorehouse.

854
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,282
Well played.

855
01:05:28,433 --> 01:05:33,250
Will Mr and Mrs Harper
please contact the enquiry desk?

856
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,532
Mr and Mrs Harper.

857
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,083
- There you are.
- Thank you.

858
01:05:39,183 --> 01:05:41,583
- Is this all your luggage?
- Yes, it is.

859
01:05:41,683 --> 01:05:42,875
Have you read this before.

860
01:05:42,975 --> 01:05:44,083
Yes.

861
01:05:44,183 --> 01:05:46,125
Have you anything to declare.

862
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:48,333
Only her lunch.

863
01:05:48,433 --> 01:05:52,708
I have a personal call from Paris
for a Monsieur Robert Gold.

864
01:05:52,808 --> 01:05:57,166
Western 7655.
Monsieur Gold? Ne quittez pas.

865
01:05:57,266 --> 01:05:59,449
Ne quittez pas.

866
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,416
Robert...

867
01:06:04,516 --> 01:06:06,833
I just couldn't help myself.

868
01:06:06,933 --> 01:06:09,458
I mean, all I wanted to do,
really, was not hurt Robert.

869
01:06:09,558 --> 01:06:11,574
You know, that was the main thing.

870
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:16,875
I kept thinking to myself, you know,
Miles would sort of burn itself out.

871
01:06:16,975 --> 01:06:21,625
And that meanwhile all that mattered was
trying to make sure that nobody got hurt.

872
01:06:21,725 --> 01:06:22,958
That was the main thing.

873
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:30,833
Tu sais bien

874
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:34,375
Ce n'est pas la fin

875
01:06:34,475 --> 01:06:37,833
De notre amour

876
01:06:37,933 --> 01:06:41,791
Ne me dis pas toujours

877
01:06:41,891 --> 01:06:45,583
Que tu ne m'aimes pas

878
01:06:45,683 --> 01:06:49,291
Que je ne t'aime pas

879
01:06:49,391 --> 01:06:52,166
Oui, tout c'est bien

880
01:06:52,266 --> 01:06:54,990
Que ce n'est pas la fin

881
01:06:57,266 --> 01:07:00,875
Tu verras

882
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:04,166
Que tu n'auras pas

883
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:07,958
Dans toute la vie

884
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:10,125
De plus belles songeries...

885
01:07:10,225 --> 01:07:11,416
Taxi!

886
01:07:11,516 --> 01:07:15,083
Donne-moi la chance

887
01:07:15,183 --> 01:07:18,166
Encore une chance...

888
01:07:18,266 --> 01:07:21,583
- Good luck with Robert.
- Thank you. Bye.

889
01:07:21,683 --> 01:07:24,532
Je sais que tu sais bien

890
01:08:10,808 --> 01:08:12,250
Is he really a crook?

891
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:14,791
Most certainly he is.
He's just served five years.

892
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:18,250
I've done an interview with him for
Sunday's programme. It's in the can.

893
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:21,000
And number 24: Man's Head in a Bucket.

894
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,041
The strongest echoes of Grünewald.

895
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:26,166
He has got a fantastically
lean and hungry look.

896
01:08:26,266 --> 01:08:28,458
Is it true he's so tremendous in bed?

897
01:08:28,558 --> 01:08:30,824
Oh, I'm afraid I didn't
get round to asking him.

898
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:34,333
- Alex, darling!
- Diana, sweetie!

899
01:08:34,433 --> 01:08:37,041
- Oh, it's terribly to see you!
- It's terribly to see you.

900
01:08:37,141 --> 01:08:39,375
- I say, isn't this is awfully?
- Yes...

901
01:08:39,475 --> 01:08:40,500
Come and meet Ralphie
before he disappears.

902
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,750
- Oh... dear.
- For another five years...

903
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:46,375
in the great tradition
of silent screams.

904
01:08:46,475 --> 01:08:49,125
Goya, Gauguin, Guernica, that tradition.

905
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,416
What I said in the interview I did
with him for the Southgate programme.

906
01:08:52,516 --> 01:08:55,916
- Oh, tremendous fire.
- I'm with you. Tremendous fire.

907
01:08:56,016 --> 01:08:58,916
A sort of furious lyricism one
seldom finds in Whitechapel these days.

908
01:08:59,016 --> 01:09:00,000
Quite so...

909
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,250
That's a load o' cobblers, all that.
One man responsible..

910
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:06,791
Ralphie, dear, I've got someone
here who's dying to meet you.

911
01:09:06,891 --> 01:09:08,833
Ralphie, you must meet Diana Scott.

912
01:09:08,933 --> 01:09:13,500
How do you do? I do so admire
your work. I think it's wonderful!

913
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,500
Thank you very much, I'm sure.

914
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,865
Now Ralphie, come and meet the agent...

915
01:09:19,516 --> 01:09:22,583
- Oh, you got here. I'm so glad.
- He's an ass.

916
01:09:22,683 --> 01:09:25,500
Don't say that.
He's tremendously talented, Ralphie.

917
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,125
When did you get in?

918
01:09:27,225 --> 01:09:29,250
This afternoon. Exhausted.

919
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:30,791
This afternoon?

920
01:09:30,891 --> 01:09:32,500
Yes, naturally, of course.

921
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,208
Yes, naturally, of course!

922
01:09:34,308 --> 01:09:36,916
Look at him. Don't you think
he's tremendously talented?

923
01:09:37,016 --> 01:09:40,625
- What about the job? How'd it go?
- Tremendous fire...

924
01:09:40,725 --> 01:09:43,875
- What job?
- The job you went to Paris to see about.

925
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:46,958
Oh, I had to do a test for Raoul Maxime.

926
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:49,125
He's a tremendous talent, Raoul.

927
01:09:49,225 --> 01:09:51,625
There's no-one in England
to beat these new French directors.

928
01:09:51,725 --> 01:09:53,583
Tremendous fire.

929
01:09:53,683 --> 01:09:55,666
Yes, I think so. Tremendous.

930
01:09:55,766 --> 01:09:57,375
And you went down well?

931
01:09:57,475 --> 01:09:59,708
Like a dozen oysters, I think.

932
01:09:59,808 --> 01:10:01,500
Taxi!

933
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,833
We're not taking a taxi.

934
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,125
Why not?

935
01:10:05,225 --> 01:10:07,407
I don't take whores in taxis.

936
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,583
What do you mean?

937
01:10:09,683 --> 01:10:11,250
That's what you are, isn't it?

938
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:13,532
A little whore. Isn't it?

939
01:10:14,391 --> 01:10:17,458
You've been back from
Paris two days already.

940
01:10:17,558 --> 01:10:19,291
Look, if you don't want me
to find out what you're doing,

941
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:23,240
don't leave your ticket and your
passport lying all over the place.

942
01:10:23,975 --> 01:10:25,699
Robert...

943
01:10:26,433 --> 01:10:27,791
I knew you'd get
the wrong end of the sti...

944
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:32,416
Your idea of fidelity is not having more
than one man in the bed at the same time.

945
01:10:32,516 --> 01:10:34,625
You're a whore, baby. That's all.

946
01:10:34,725 --> 01:10:36,907
Just a whore.

947
01:10:37,808 --> 01:10:40,574
And I don't take whores in taxis.

948
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,833
Now what?

949
01:10:43,933 --> 01:10:45,208
A pound's not enough.

950
01:10:45,308 --> 01:10:48,458
- What do you mean?
- A pound's not enough.

951
01:10:48,558 --> 01:10:50,875
- Now, wait a minute...
- Don't you give me "Wait a minute"!

952
01:10:50,975 --> 01:10:53,041
- A pound's not enough!
- Diana, don't be a...

953
01:10:53,141 --> 01:10:54,291
Don't you "Diana" me.

954
01:10:54,391 --> 01:10:58,166
It was kinky before and still is,
and a pound's not enough.

955
01:10:58,266 --> 01:11:01,500
Makes a lot of promises.
But when he's had his way...

956
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,666
You're not worth more
than a bloody quid, anyway.

957
01:11:03,766 --> 01:11:06,041
I'm an honest working girl!

958
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:09,500
Five bob in the Walworth Road.
That's about your bloody mark.

959
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,666
You crumb.

960
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:15,458
You creepy crumb!

961
01:11:15,558 --> 01:11:19,824
Crumb. You creep. Let go of me.

962
01:11:23,183 --> 01:11:25,125
Five bob in the Walworth Road?

963
01:11:25,225 --> 01:11:27,125
- What were you doing in Paris, anyway?
- Working.

964
01:11:27,225 --> 01:11:28,500
I hope you got more than five bob.

965
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,333
I should think I did.
I wasn't with you, was I?

966
01:11:30,433 --> 01:11:31,875
Fine. Help yourself.

967
01:11:31,975 --> 01:11:34,166
Oh. Quelle largesse! I'm impressed.

968
01:11:34,266 --> 01:11:36,333
You bitch. You're a filthy little bitch.

969
01:11:36,433 --> 01:11:39,208
You've got no right to call me anything.

970
01:11:39,308 --> 01:11:41,250
I have every right
to call you everything.

971
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:43,208
Oh, have you? We're not married.

972
01:11:43,308 --> 01:11:45,208
At least not to each other.

973
01:11:45,308 --> 01:11:48,458
I'd never have believed that one so trivial
and shallow could cause such pain.

974
01:11:48,558 --> 01:11:50,125
Oh, blameless Gold!

975
01:11:50,225 --> 01:11:52,916
If you want to know, I've stuck it out
just about as long as I can.

976
01:11:53,016 --> 01:11:55,208
Yes, and just about as often as you can.

977
01:11:55,308 --> 01:11:58,375
And you're so faithful
and so loving, aren't you?

978
01:11:58,475 --> 01:12:00,750
Look at this place, this rattrap!

979
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:03,375
- I won't be a prisoner any longer.
- So you're the prisoner are you?

980
01:12:03,475 --> 01:12:04,500
Yes!

981
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,500
Prying in my life, looking
in my handbag, spying on me!

982
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,833
The quickest way of getting to know you.

983
01:12:09,933 --> 01:12:12,958
You never intended to stay or you'd
have done something with this place.

984
01:12:13,058 --> 01:12:14,291
Look at it!

985
01:12:14,391 --> 01:12:18,083
Books! My God, I hate books!

986
01:12:18,183 --> 01:12:19,791
- Stop that!
- That gets to you.

987
01:12:19,891 --> 01:12:23,532
Anybody touching your books.
They matter to you more than anybody!

988
01:12:36,766 --> 01:12:38,824
Robert...

989
01:12:42,008 --> 01:12:44,657
What the hell are you doing?

990
01:12:47,141 --> 01:12:49,750
Robert, don't be so melodramatic.

991
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:51,416
Excuse me.

992
01:12:51,516 --> 01:12:53,083
Robert...

993
01:12:53,183 --> 01:12:55,157
Where are you going?

994
01:13:05,933 --> 01:13:09,032
Oh, it just all seemed so unnecessary,
you know, these dramas.

995
01:13:09,766 --> 01:13:13,416
I couldn't help feeling Robert had been
desperately unreasonable about it all.

996
01:13:13,516 --> 01:13:17,041
You know, after all, we were
supposed to be adult people.

997
01:13:17,141 --> 01:13:20,791
Well, one just had to take
a grip on oneself, that was all.

998
01:13:20,891 --> 01:13:26,291
I just knew the only possible hope was
just to fling oneself into one's work.

999
01:13:26,391 --> 01:13:29,208
It was either that, you know,
or the old gas oven.

1000
01:13:29,308 --> 01:13:31,125
One, two.

1001
01:13:31,225 --> 01:13:33,833
Happy. Happy...

1002
01:13:33,933 --> 01:13:35,916
The happiest girl in the world, now.
Come on. That's it.

1003
01:13:36,016 --> 01:13:38,291
Good. Good. Come on, happy girl.

1004
01:13:38,391 --> 01:13:39,875
Better.

1005
01:13:39,975 --> 01:13:42,458
Brighter. Happiest girl
in the world, now.

1006
01:13:42,558 --> 01:13:45,500
Now. Good.
Swing your hair round suddenly.

1007
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,375
That's it. Cool. Good. Lovely. Again.

1008
01:13:48,475 --> 01:13:53,000
Good. Good. Again. Good.
That's it, darling.

1009
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,458
Look up. Think lovely... thoughts.

1010
01:13:55,558 --> 01:13:57,208
Brighter. Come on, duckie. Forget it.

1011
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:59,666
We've all been through it.
For Christ's sake, smile, love.

1012
01:13:59,766 --> 01:14:02,449
Go on? That's it. All right. That's it.

1013
01:14:03,308 --> 01:14:06,500
Come on. Sorry. Lovely,
dear. Come on, forget it.

1014
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,708
It's all right, don't cry.
Jolly good, jolly good. Marvellous.

1015
01:14:10,808 --> 01:14:13,500
What is it, darling? What is it?
Come on, drinkie-poos...

1016
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,282
- Drinkies, love. Come on.
- Oh, Mel...

1017
01:14:18,891 --> 01:14:20,958
Gonna be a happy girl, then?

1018
01:14:21,058 --> 01:14:22,625
Gonna be happy?

1019
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:25,041
Cause we already are
a very pretty girl, you know.

1020
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:33,916
Yes... She's very good.

1021
01:14:34,016 --> 01:14:37,240
- I don't know whether...
- Thank you.

1022
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:40,833
Could we have a look at that again,
please? Thank you so much.

1023
01:14:40,933 --> 01:14:43,000
- Yes...
- Yes...

1024
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:46,166
The question is,
is she over-experienced?

1025
01:14:46,266 --> 01:14:47,500
Sorry?

1026
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,333
Have the public seen
too much of her face?

1027
01:14:50,433 --> 01:14:53,125
How can you see too much
of this face, I ask you?

1028
01:14:53,225 --> 01:14:55,375
We do get continuity of image.

1029
01:14:55,475 --> 01:14:57,365
- Good thinking.
- Hear, hear.

1030
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,625
Buy her, then, do you, Kurt?

1031
01:15:02,725 --> 01:15:03,958
Definitely.

1032
01:15:04,058 --> 01:15:07,966
You know, she's got a sort of Aryan quality.
She'll go down well in Germany.

1033
01:15:12,058 --> 01:15:14,375
How about this for the Happiness girl?

1034
01:15:19,183 --> 01:15:21,282
But you must have a look at it.

1035
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,958
Yes. For the German territory,
I am happy.

1036
01:15:27,058 --> 01:15:31,291
Well, there it is. We want you
to be the Happiness Boy, Kurt.

1037
01:15:31,391 --> 01:15:33,500
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

1038
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,250
Very well, then. We're all agreed.

1039
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:39,625
Diana Scott, hereinafter
known as the Happiness Girl.

1040
01:15:48,016 --> 01:15:50,875
For you, the man who
turned the tide at Monte Carlo.

1041
01:15:50,975 --> 01:15:53,625
Darling. Bless you.

1042
01:15:53,725 --> 01:15:56,041
Whoa!

1043
01:16:45,725 --> 01:16:46,916
May I help you, madam?

1044
01:16:47,016 --> 01:16:50,333
Yes, do you think I could see some...
peaches in brandy, please?

1045
01:16:50,433 --> 01:16:52,615
Certainly, madam.
If you'd just come this way.

1046
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,240
Yes...

1047
01:16:59,808 --> 01:17:01,416
Have you got a larger size I could see?

1048
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:04,324
Yes, madam. Just wait one moment.

1049
01:17:05,433 --> 01:17:09,824
- Brandy. Bit expensive, but...
- Far too expensive.

1050
01:17:12,266 --> 01:17:13,458
It looks delicious to me this...

1051
01:17:13,558 --> 01:17:18,041
I am not with you! I have never
seen you before in my vie.

1052
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:21,166
You're in this up to your navel.

1053
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:23,199
We can't stay here all day, you know.

1054
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:26,291
Thank you Madam.

1055
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:29,833
Oh, no. I did want them in a bottle.
No, thank you very much indeed.

1056
01:17:29,933 --> 01:17:31,666
- We'll forget it.
- Thank you, madam.

1057
01:17:31,766 --> 01:17:33,324
Thank you.

1058
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:43,250
These look very nice.

1059
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:45,833
Oh, what about these prawns?
They look delicious!

1060
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:47,250
Did you see that?

1061
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:49,083
Outrageous behaviour!

1062
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:53,333
- I could've sworn he was following us.
- He was!

1063
01:17:53,433 --> 01:17:55,458
- Outrageous.
- Oh, dear.

1064
01:17:55,558 --> 01:17:58,833
- Robert...
- R-r-r-rule Britannia!

1065
01:17:58,933 --> 01:18:04,208
- Britannia rules...
- Oh, my dear!

1066
01:18:04,308 --> 01:18:05,583
Ting-a-ling! Shop's open.

1067
01:18:05,683 --> 01:18:08,625
Ting-a-ling! The shop's denuded!
Honestly, you are outrageous, dear,

1068
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:14,032
and I would like you to know, dear,
that we have only paid for shrimps.

1069
01:18:15,225 --> 01:18:17,791
What's that? The Happiness Girl
contract already?

1070
01:18:17,891 --> 01:18:20,074
Oh, dear, my husband wants a divorce.

1071
01:18:21,933 --> 01:18:23,782
My husband Tony. He wants a divorce.

1072
01:18:27,975 --> 01:18:31,199
Well, granted soon as asked, I'm sure.

1073
01:18:32,558 --> 01:18:35,083
I... hate... this... flat.

1074
01:18:35,183 --> 01:18:38,365
Well, you've got your escargots, anyway.

1075
01:18:40,766 --> 01:18:45,083
Have an avocado, strangled with prunes.

1076
01:18:45,183 --> 01:18:47,000
Have a bit of smoked salmon,

1077
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:53,083
stuffed with caviar,
matured in fine English gin.

1078
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:57,032
For what you are about to receive
may the Lord make you truly thankful.

1079
01:18:58,975 --> 01:19:03,449
Cheers!

1080
01:19:10,433 --> 01:19:13,657
Oh, my life is a pisspot!

1081
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:17,574
- Well, you see, I have the answer to that.
- Oh, yes? Have you?

1082
01:19:18,266 --> 01:19:20,625
It's the bomb, lovey. It must be.

1083
01:19:20,725 --> 01:19:24,125
That's right. It's the great, big...

1084
01:19:24,225 --> 01:19:26,240
nasty, nasty bomb!

1085
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,583
Let's face it, dear.

1086
01:19:29,683 --> 01:19:33,166
Darling's life is
a great, big, steaming mess.

1087
01:19:35,266 --> 01:19:39,250
Oh, I love you, if no-one else does.

1088
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:42,458
- Well, no-one else does.
- Poor you!

1089
01:19:42,558 --> 01:19:44,416
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do with you.

1090
01:19:44,516 --> 01:19:46,500
Go on...

1091
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:50,333
Well, I may be filming
in Italy next month,

1092
01:19:50,433 --> 01:19:51,458
- Italy?
- Yes.

1093
01:19:51,558 --> 01:19:53,375
Rather fabulous, darling...

1094
01:19:53,475 --> 01:19:58,875
And if I do, I'm going afterwards on
the most wonderful holiday of my life

1095
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:00,750
and you're coming with me.

1096
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:05,666
- Oh, I am?
- You are! To hell with them all.

1097
01:20:05,766 --> 01:20:07,833
We're gonna have a ball.

1098
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:12,125
- Have a ball, have a ball!
- Have a ball!

1099
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:14,333
- To hell with 'em all!
- To hell with 'em all!

1100
01:20:14,433 --> 01:20:17,407
We'll 'ave a ball! Down with 'em all!

1101
01:20:29,433 --> 01:20:31,615
Ashes to ashes...

1102
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,282
dust to dust.

1103
01:20:51,808 --> 01:20:56,041
Cupids are the chocolates to choose

1104
01:20:56,141 --> 01:21:02,416
For the one you love to caress

1105
01:21:02,516 --> 01:21:06,916
Chocolates with the fairy-tale centres

1106
01:21:07,016 --> 01:21:08,708
They're the best...

1107
01:21:08,808 --> 01:21:12,208
Yes, there's nothing dreamier
than Cupid Chocolates.

1108
01:21:12,308 --> 01:21:15,458
Those fairy-tale centres
take you out of this world

1109
01:21:15,558 --> 01:21:18,375
into a land of make-believe come true.

1110
01:21:18,475 --> 01:21:22,708
Fairy-tale chocolates by Cupid

1111
01:21:22,808 --> 01:21:24,333
- Cut it!
- Cut it!

1112
01:21:24,433 --> 01:21:26,250
- How was that?
- Not bad. Could be better.

1113
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:29,958
- Yes...
- In all, 35 seconds.

1114
01:21:30,058 --> 01:21:33,375
- Listen...
- I'm a bit worried about the caress thing.

1115
01:21:33,475 --> 01:21:36,583
Could he caress her this time? The jingle
does say "the one you love to caress".

1116
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:38,125
- Yeah, yeah...
- It's talking about the girl.

1117
01:21:38,225 --> 01:21:39,291
We'll try it that way this time.

1118
01:21:39,391 --> 01:21:42,750
Darling, listen. This time would
you... would you let him caress you?

1119
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:45,291
Would you let... him touch your cheek?

1120
01:21:45,391 --> 01:21:47,125
What? He... I caress...

1121
01:21:47,225 --> 01:21:49,125
No, he caresses you.

1122
01:21:49,225 --> 01:21:50,833
All right. Please, don't break it up.

1123
01:21:50,933 --> 01:21:53,750
- Come on, boys. Quiet.
- Let's try a take for the prince.

1124
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:56,708
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Hello. How do you do?

1125
01:21:56,808 --> 01:21:59,041
Excuse me...

1126
01:21:59,141 --> 01:22:03,041
Don't you think that the house would be
much much better, seen from this angle?

1127
01:22:03,141 --> 01:22:04,500
Er... yes, sir,

1128
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,416
but you see,
it's a question of the light.

1129
01:22:06,716 --> 01:22:08,921
Oh, the light.

1130
01:22:11,933 --> 01:22:15,282
- Scene two, take three.
- Action!

1131
01:22:15,725 --> 01:22:18,958
Yes, there's nothing dreamier
than Cupid Chocolates.

1132
01:22:19,058 --> 01:22:22,166
Those fairy-tale centres
take you out of this world

1133
01:22:22,266 --> 01:22:24,500
into a land of make-believe come true.

1134
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,750
As those fairy-tale
centres melt in the mouth,

1135
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:30,750
they'll melt the heart
of the one you love to caress.

1136
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:32,449
Fairy-tale centres...

1137
01:23:23,516 --> 01:23:25,907
He is the Pope Urbano.

1138
01:23:26,975 --> 01:23:30,199
One of my father's many ancestors.

1139
01:23:31,058 --> 01:23:33,416
Should Popes be ancestors?

1140
01:23:33,516 --> 01:23:36,166
Well, the call came late in life.

1141
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:39,490
He was an ancestor
before becoming a pope.

1142
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,750
I don't see much resemblance.

1143
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:47,074
He was better-looking
when he was younger.

1144
01:23:49,808 --> 01:23:55,125
- Who is she?
- My mother. She was very beautiful.

1145
01:23:55,225 --> 01:23:59,875
- Was?
- She died two years ago in a car crash.

1146
01:23:59,975 --> 01:24:02,000
Oh, how awful.

1147
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:05,333
- Very awful.
- Here you are.

1148
01:24:05,433 --> 01:24:06,791
I've ordered some tea.

1149
01:24:06,891 --> 01:24:08,657
How marvellous!

1150
01:24:09,183 --> 01:24:12,000
Curzio's been giving me
some of the family history.

1151
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,583
Oh, yes.

1152
01:24:13,683 --> 01:24:16,958
Excuse me, I must go.
I have a long way to drive,

1153
01:24:17,058 --> 01:24:18,458
But I hope we will meet again.

1154
01:24:18,558 --> 01:24:21,625
- I hope so.
- Goodbye. Till soon, then.

1155
01:24:21,725 --> 01:24:23,500
Till soon.

1156
01:24:27,516 --> 01:24:29,375
He's a nice boy, Curzio.

1157
01:24:29,475 --> 01:24:32,666
Yes. Yes, very.

1158
01:24:36,516 --> 01:24:39,500
- It's so beautiful.
- I'm glad you like it.

1159
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,916
There's nothing like
this in England. Thank you.

1160
01:24:42,016 --> 01:24:44,833
But you have in England the most
beautiful country houses in the world.

1161
01:24:44,933 --> 01:24:46,964
Have a chocolate.

1162
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,240
No, it's different here.
There's a sense of...

1163
01:24:51,183 --> 01:24:53,125
eternity.

1164
01:24:53,225 --> 01:24:55,407
A sort of peacefulness.

1165
01:24:56,725 --> 01:25:00,574
It is almost... religious,
if you know what I mean.

1166
01:25:01,391 --> 01:25:02,875
Yes.

1167
01:25:02,975 --> 01:25:06,625
Well, it seems to make life
easier to bear.

1168
01:25:06,725 --> 01:25:11,166
But you don't have any problem
in bearing the weight of life. Do you?

1169
01:25:11,266 --> 01:25:12,583
I don't know about that.

1170
01:25:12,683 --> 01:25:16,449
Well, on you it must weigh
very lightly. For me, it's different.

1171
01:25:19,766 --> 01:25:22,208
I recently lost someone too.

1172
01:25:22,308 --> 01:25:23,865
Not like you did, but...

1173
01:25:24,933 --> 01:25:27,875
Well, I don't much care to
go back to England just now.

1174
01:25:27,975 --> 01:25:30,666
- Do you have a family?
- Not like yours.

1175
01:25:30,766 --> 01:25:34,532
Not that supports one,
gives one strength.

1176
01:25:34,975 --> 01:25:39,500
- You have God practically in the family.
- Oh..

1177
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:44,291
Well, you know, every man is alone in the
last resolve, and I more than most men.

1178
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:48,375
Well, perhaps not. In some ways.

1179
01:25:52,308 --> 01:25:53,916
They're beautiful.

1180
01:25:54,016 --> 01:25:55,958
Yes. Like their mother.

1181
01:25:56,058 --> 01:25:59,416
They are. They really are lovely.

1182
01:26:02,475 --> 01:26:03,916
Well, now you must excuse me.

1183
01:26:04,016 --> 01:26:05,875
I swim with them every day, you know.

1184
01:26:05,975 --> 01:26:08,625
It's a duty which is also pleasure.

1185
01:26:08,725 --> 01:26:11,949
- Excuse me, will you?
- Of course. Thank you so much.

1186
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:22,250
I don't think I'd ever needed a holiday
quite so much as I did then,

1187
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:24,708
and Capri was ideal.

1188
01:26:24,808 --> 01:26:30,657
I just wanted peace and quiet and
to get away from everything, really.

1189
01:27:07,725 --> 01:27:10,416
Campari?

1190
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:14,282
Due Campari per favore.

1191
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:25,625
We are not complicating our holiday
with any disgusting sexcapades...

1192
01:27:25,725 --> 01:27:27,750
Brother and sister
till death do us part?

1193
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:29,791
- Done.
- Share and share alike.

1194
01:27:29,891 --> 01:27:33,199
- Everything split down the middle.
- Absolutely.

1195
01:27:36,183 --> 01:27:39,916
- Now, tell us what's new in London.
- Oh, nothing much.

1196
01:27:40,016 --> 01:27:41,833
I'll tell you who I did bump into.

1197
01:27:41,933 --> 01:27:44,500
- Mm-hm...
- Robert.

1198
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,958
- My Robert?
- The same.

1199
01:27:47,058 --> 01:27:48,833
And?

1200
01:27:48,933 --> 01:27:51,541
- Seemed OK.
- Alone?

1201
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:54,166
- Me or him?
- I don't care who you were with.

1202
01:27:54,266 --> 01:27:56,333
Charming.

1203
01:27:56,433 --> 01:27:58,041
Do you care who he was with?

1204
01:27:58,141 --> 01:28:00,324
No, not particularly.

1205
01:28:01,933 --> 01:28:03,041
What was she like?

1206
01:28:03,141 --> 01:28:07,657
Blonde. 21 . Extremely
well-appointed, as they say.

1207
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:10,907
Grazie.

1208
01:28:13,975 --> 01:28:17,375
It's OK. He was alone.

1209
01:28:17,475 --> 01:28:18,958
- He wasn't.
- I swear.

1210
01:28:19,058 --> 01:28:20,875
You rotten thing, you...

1211
01:28:20,975 --> 01:28:23,958
I know. Happy holiday!

1212
01:28:24,058 --> 01:28:25,375
And you, principe.

1213
01:28:25,475 --> 01:28:27,657
And you.

1214
01:28:50,891 --> 01:28:56,865
- Oh, my, what a dream.
- Oh, it's super.

1215
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,416
I was just thinking how nice it
would be if we could live here.

1216
01:29:50,808 --> 01:29:53,541
I could do without sex.

1217
01:29:53,641 --> 01:29:56,115
Don't really like it that much.

1218
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,824
If I could just feel...

1219
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:07,615
complete.

1220
01:30:13,725 --> 01:30:18,250
Oh, Mal, let's buy this place.
It can't cost much.

1221
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:20,500
It'd be marvellous.

1222
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:24,208
I want it more than
anything in the whole world.

1223
01:30:24,308 --> 01:30:25,824
Happy girl?

1224
01:32:58,850 --> 01:33:00,532
Mal.

1225
01:33:06,516 --> 01:33:11,365
Are you ready, Eddie? Scusi il ritardo.

1226
01:33:29,183 --> 01:33:31,365
- Morning.
- Morning.

1227
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,824
- Caffè, signorina?
- Yes.

1228
01:33:45,433 --> 01:33:47,875
Traitor.

1229
01:33:47,975 --> 01:33:52,240
- Why the harsh words?
- Harsh word. One is sufficient.

1230
01:33:53,516 --> 01:33:55,500
Darling, really.

1231
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,449
Brother and sister
till death us do part.

1232
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:22,916
Well, I happened to be passing,

1233
01:34:23,016 --> 01:34:27,083
so I thought, why not drop in?

1234
01:34:27,183 --> 01:34:29,032
Why not, indeed!

1235
01:34:30,891 --> 01:34:35,791
Diana, I've been thinking
about you a lot,

1236
01:34:35,891 --> 01:34:38,750
Oh, that's nice.

1237
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:40,625
And... what you said.

1238
01:34:40,725 --> 01:34:42,375
Did I say something?

1239
01:34:42,475 --> 01:34:44,791
Yes, about Italy.

1240
01:34:44,891 --> 01:34:49,199
- How much you like it.
- Oh, yes. I simply adore it.

1241
01:34:52,266 --> 01:34:55,824
Curzio is very taken with you, you know.

1242
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:59,541
Well... he's very young.

1243
01:34:59,641 --> 01:35:04,208
He recognises a certain quality in you.

1244
01:35:04,308 --> 01:35:06,416
I expect he'll get over it.

1245
01:35:06,516 --> 01:35:09,166
I don't think so.

1246
01:35:09,266 --> 01:35:12,625
He was very much in
favour of my coming here.

1247
01:35:12,725 --> 01:35:15,875
As a matter of fact,
he persuaded me to come.

1248
01:35:15,975 --> 01:35:17,250
Why?

1249
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:21,574
- I am afraid I don't understand.
- To propose to you.

1250
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,375
But... why couldn't
he have proposed himself?

1251
01:35:25,475 --> 01:35:27,875
I mean it, it's
all ridiculously childish, but...

1252
01:35:27,975 --> 01:35:30,666
Good you approve that
I should propose to you

1253
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:33,625
since...

1254
01:35:33,725 --> 01:35:35,574
it is I who wishes to marry you.

1255
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:38,115
I see.

1256
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:44,708
There is no point in not
saying what is in one's heart.

1257
01:35:44,808 --> 01:35:48,032
No really, principe.

1258
01:35:51,391 --> 01:35:53,949
- Cesare.
- Cesare.

1259
01:35:54,516 --> 01:35:56,333
I'm staying here until tomorrow.

1260
01:35:56,433 --> 01:35:58,615
Will you think it over?

1261
01:36:23,891 --> 01:36:25,166
Ciao!

1262
01:36:25,266 --> 01:36:28,500
Buona sera!

1263
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,824
Scusi ma lavorara.

1264
01:36:33,141 --> 01:36:34,699
Le mani...

1265
01:36:50,933 --> 01:36:53,115
- Ciao.
- Ci vediamo...

1266
01:36:55,391 --> 01:36:58,125
I thought about it all last night.

1267
01:36:58,225 --> 01:37:01,449
I hardly slept at all, Cesare, thinking.

1268
01:37:02,891 --> 01:37:06,500
I know I can't...
I can't give up my life.

1269
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:08,824
You understand?

1270
01:37:11,558 --> 01:37:12,625
Well...

1271
01:37:12,725 --> 01:37:16,083
If you ever change your mind,
I shall not have changed mine.

1272
01:37:16,183 --> 01:37:19,125
I am very sorry I gave
you sleepless night.

1273
01:37:19,225 --> 01:37:22,250
I too had one. Goodbye.

1274
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:24,750
Goodbye, Cesare.

1275
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:26,250
- Andiamo.
- Sì, signore.

1276
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:27,907
Andiamo.

1277
01:37:51,433 --> 01:37:54,041
Bye-bye, principe.

1278
01:37:54,141 --> 01:37:57,282
Arrivederci, Roma!

1279
01:38:25,391 --> 01:38:27,958
When they bury
Walter Southgate tomorrow,

1280
01:38:28,058 --> 01:38:32,833
there will be buried with him something of
the regional tradition of English literature.

1281
01:38:32,933 --> 01:38:37,333
Nowadays, it is London which,
more and more, devours the talents.

1282
01:38:37,433 --> 01:38:43,541
"London, that damn jam factory,
boiling out the goodness from writers",

1283
01:38:43,641 --> 01:38:46,458
as Southgate once said to me.

1284
01:38:46,558 --> 01:38:50,958
A certain flinty integrity has gone.

1285
01:38:51,058 --> 01:38:53,291
Perhaps forever.

1286
01:38:53,391 --> 01:38:55,000
Good night.

1287
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:57,458
And that's all from us for this week.

1288
01:38:57,558 --> 01:39:01,541
We'll be back with you again with
another programme, in a fortnight's time.

1289
01:39:01,641 --> 01:39:03,699
Till then, good night.

1290
01:39:29,516 --> 01:39:33,208
Someone who cares about you

1291
01:39:33,308 --> 01:39:36,833
Someone there

1292
01:39:36,933 --> 01:39:40,375
When you fail

1293
01:39:40,475 --> 01:39:43,541
Every time you try

1294
01:39:43,641 --> 01:39:47,166
You need someone

1295
01:39:47,266 --> 01:39:50,833
To help you get on by

1296
01:39:50,933 --> 01:39:54,333
Someone to talk to

1297
01:39:54,433 --> 01:39:57,916
Someone to love you

1298
01:39:58,016 --> 01:40:02,041
Someone to walk beside you

1299
01:40:02,141 --> 01:40:06,958
On the way

1300
01:40:07,058 --> 01:40:14,125
Someone to talk to, baby

1301
01:40:14,225 --> 01:40:20,125
Someone who needs you just like me

1302
01:40:20,225 --> 01:40:23,625
And the one

1303
01:40:23,725 --> 01:40:26,875
Who will understand

1304
01:40:26,975 --> 01:40:30,500
Yes, and the one

1305
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,125
Who wants to hold your hand

1306
01:40:34,225 --> 01:40:37,625
Someone to talk to

1307
01:40:37,725 --> 01:40:41,208
Someone who wants you

1308
01:40:41,308 --> 01:40:44,458
Someone to love you

1309
01:40:44,558 --> 01:40:47,208
More and more each day

1310
01:40:47,308 --> 01:40:50,532
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ee-yay...

1311
01:40:52,558 --> 01:40:53,916
Ice.

1312
01:40:54,016 --> 01:41:01,041
Someone to talk to, baby

1313
01:41:01,141 --> 01:41:07,041
Someone who needs you just like me

1314
01:41:07,141 --> 01:41:10,500
And the one

1315
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,791
Who will understand

1316
01:41:13,891 --> 01:41:17,416
Yes, and the one

1317
01:41:17,516 --> 01:41:21,083
Who wants to hold your hand

1318
01:41:21,183 --> 01:41:24,625
Someone to talk to

1319
01:41:24,725 --> 01:41:28,208
Someone who wants you

1320
01:41:28,308 --> 01:41:29,916
Someone who loves you...

1321
01:41:30,016 --> 01:41:34,699
Well... Where did all
the young flowers go?

1322
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:39,375
Proceed.

1323
01:41:39,475 --> 01:41:40,875
Amuse me.

1324
01:41:40,975 --> 01:41:44,458
Someone to talk to, baby

1325
01:41:44,558 --> 01:41:47,907
Someone to talk to, baby...

1326
01:42:24,141 --> 01:42:27,699
I wondered if you
knew Southgate had died.

1327
01:42:28,641 --> 01:42:30,541
Could I?

1328
01:42:30,641 --> 01:42:32,699
What's going on?

1329
01:42:45,433 --> 01:42:47,615
I think you'd better go.

1330
01:42:53,183 --> 01:42:55,375
Get out of here, will you?

1331
01:42:55,475 --> 01:42:59,365
Just get out of here.

1332
01:43:11,225 --> 01:43:14,125
I thought you'd gone too.

1333
01:43:14,225 --> 01:43:18,208
You bastard. You really are,
aren't you? A bastard...

1334
01:43:18,308 --> 01:43:20,541
- Would you like some tea?
- Tea?

1335
01:43:20,641 --> 01:43:23,907
To calm you down.
You seem a bit hysterical.

1336
01:43:27,391 --> 01:43:30,416
I asked you to go. Why haven't you?

1337
01:43:30,516 --> 01:43:32,699
Because I've stayed.

1338
01:43:36,225 --> 01:43:39,199
- What is it?
- Nothing.

1339
01:43:39,641 --> 01:43:41,000
Are you afraid of something?

1340
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,708
I get the feeling
you're afraid of something.

1341
01:43:43,808 --> 01:43:45,032
What's wrong?

1342
01:43:46,058 --> 01:43:47,615
Wrong?

1343
01:43:48,766 --> 01:43:50,032
Nothing.

1344
01:43:53,975 --> 01:43:56,791
I didn't ask you
to leave Robert, you know.

1345
01:43:56,891 --> 01:43:58,958
You never ask me to do anything.

1346
01:43:59,058 --> 01:44:01,666
As long as you realise.

1347
01:44:01,766 --> 01:44:04,250
As long as you realise
I just hate your guts.

1348
01:44:04,350 --> 01:44:08,500
As long as you realise Robert's
the only person I ever remotely loved.

1349
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,833
When you've finished.

1350
01:44:10,933 --> 01:44:14,074
As long as you're convinced, you don't
have to persuade me, my darling.

1351
01:44:17,850 --> 01:44:20,199
You are afraid I'll kill myself?

1352
01:44:23,433 --> 01:44:25,449
Has that ever happened to you?

1353
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:32,166
Who was she, Miles?

1354
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:35,666
Put away your Penguin Freud, Diana.

1355
01:44:35,766 --> 01:44:39,500
- Who was she?
- And your crystal ball.

1356
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,824
It's late.

1357
01:44:48,141 --> 01:44:52,125
Poor Miles. You can't risk
feeling anything, can you?

1358
01:44:52,225 --> 01:44:53,625
I shall survive.

1359
01:44:53,725 --> 01:44:55,958
Of course... as long
as you remain impotent.

1360
01:44:56,058 --> 01:45:00,166
My impotence, my darling,
makes a pair with your virginity.

1361
01:45:00,266 --> 01:45:03,375
Impotent in every way, except in bed.

1362
01:45:03,475 --> 01:45:08,000
Don't underestimate me my dear. I can
also be very effective on the telephone.

1363
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:10,824
I'll say good night.

1364
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:16,208
Life is full of "if onlys", isn't it?

1365
01:45:16,308 --> 01:45:19,666
You know: if only, if only...

1366
01:45:19,766 --> 01:45:24,032
If only Robert had come half an hour later,
the whole thing might've been different.

1367
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:29,916
Oh, I... I sort of felt
it wasn't any good, you know.

1368
01:45:30,016 --> 01:45:33,250
I just had to go
and try to find him again.

1369
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:35,000
I remember thinking:

1370
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:37,240
I bet he will be at that funeral.

1371
01:45:41,391 --> 01:45:44,291
"The days of man are but as grass,

1372
01:45:44,391 --> 01:45:48,375
"but he flourishes
as a flower or as a field.

1373
01:45:48,475 --> 01:45:52,333
"For as the wind goeth
over it, it is gone,

1374
01:45:52,433 --> 01:45:55,115
"and the place thereof
shall know it no more.

1375
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:59,791
"We commend unto thy own hands
of mercy, most merciful Father,

1376
01:45:59,891 --> 01:46:03,625
"the soul of this, our brother,
Walter Southgate, departed,

1377
01:46:03,725 --> 01:46:06,083
"and we commit his body to the ground,

1378
01:46:06,183 --> 01:46:09,041
"earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

1379
01:46:09,141 --> 01:46:10,833
"and dust to dust,

1380
01:46:10,933 --> 01:46:13,833
"in the sure and certain
hope of the resurrection

1381
01:46:13,933 --> 01:46:18,250
"to eternal life,
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

1382
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:21,666
"who shall change the body
of our low estate

1383
01:46:21,766 --> 01:46:25,208
"that it be like unto His glory..."

1384
01:46:25,308 --> 01:46:26,875
- Miss Scott?
- Yes.

1385
01:46:26,975 --> 01:46:29,166
- Lesley Page, Evening Standard.
- Oh, yes?

1386
01:46:29,266 --> 01:46:31,166
I didn't know you knew Walter Southgate.

1387
01:46:31,266 --> 01:46:34,458
Oh, yes, we were
considerable friends, actually.

1388
01:46:34,558 --> 01:46:39,000
- When was this?
- Oh, about two years ago.

1389
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:42,000
He found out how much
I admired his work and...

1390
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:45,083
sweet man, he invited
me round to see him.

1391
01:46:45,183 --> 01:46:47,041
Which was your favourite book?

1392
01:46:47,141 --> 01:46:49,750
Oh, all of them.

1393
01:46:49,850 --> 01:46:54,125
As a matter of fact, I may be
filming one of his books in Paris.

1394
01:46:54,225 --> 01:46:56,125
- Really?
- Yes, I'm talking to Raoul Maxime.

1395
01:46:56,225 --> 01:46:57,949
You know, the French film director...

1396
01:47:30,725 --> 01:47:33,000
- Hello.
- Diana...

1397
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:37,125
- Yes, Robert...
- "Yes, Robert"...?

1398
01:47:37,225 --> 01:47:40,333
Who is that? Malcolm, is that you?

1399
01:47:40,433 --> 01:47:43,916
I rang to congratulate you,
I just read in the paper about the film.

1400
01:47:44,016 --> 01:47:47,416
- Who is that?
- That is Diana Scott...?

1401
01:47:47,516 --> 01:47:50,291
Yes, it is. Will you tell me
who's speaking, please?

1402
01:47:51,266 --> 01:47:53,166
I wish I was Robert...

1403
01:47:53,266 --> 01:47:55,541
Please, who is that speaking?

1404
01:47:55,641 --> 01:47:58,541
Oh, come on now, we met
a couple of times, at a party...

1405
01:47:58,641 --> 01:48:00,708
For God's sakes, who is it?

1406
01:48:05,183 --> 01:48:10,190
For Christ's sakes, stop mucking around.
Tell me who's speaking!

1407
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:14,282
Hello...

1408
01:48:23,016 --> 01:48:25,824
Oh, I just felt I'd absolutely
no-one to turn to.

1409
01:48:26,308 --> 01:48:30,083
No-one to turn to.
Nothing to fall back on. You know...

1410
01:48:30,183 --> 01:48:32,458
Then, suddenly there
was someone who really understood,

1411
01:48:32,558 --> 01:48:34,375
who really cared about me.

1412
01:48:34,475 --> 01:48:36,750
Didn't want anything out of me.

1413
01:48:36,850 --> 01:48:39,750
He was so terribly understanding,
Father Chapman.

1414
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:41,083
Do you know him?

1415
01:48:41,183 --> 01:48:43,500
He's Monsignor Chapman now.

1416
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,699
Now, he's a terrible sweetie.
Terribly human.

1417
01:48:49,141 --> 01:48:51,750
I suppose I've always believed in God.

1418
01:48:51,850 --> 01:48:54,250
Just has to be a God, doesn't there?

1419
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:57,000
You know. Somebody who understands.

1420
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:59,958
Just has to be.

1421
01:49:00,058 --> 01:49:02,791
I really took it
very seriously, you know.

1422
01:49:02,891 --> 01:49:05,416
I knew I couldn't go ahead
with my marriage,

1423
01:49:05,516 --> 01:49:09,250
unless I was really serious about it.

1424
01:49:25,975 --> 01:49:29,166
It isn't everyday that we have
a new English princess,

1425
01:49:29,266 --> 01:49:33,833
but it happened last week at the ancient
home of the Prince Cesare della Romita

1426
01:49:33,933 --> 01:49:37,208
when our own Diana Scott became
the bride of this famous Italian prince

1427
01:49:37,308 --> 01:49:40,875
and bobsleigh enthusiast.

1428
01:49:40,975 --> 01:49:45,083
Everyone was there: old family friends,
the people from the estate.

1429
01:49:45,183 --> 01:49:48,949
And, my goodness, how happy they were
to find themselves with a mistress again.

1430
01:49:49,641 --> 01:49:52,416
The prince, who stems
from one of Italy's oldest families,

1431
01:49:52,516 --> 01:49:55,416
has been married before
and has seven children.

1432
01:49:55,516 --> 01:49:59,949
It isn't every princess who finds herself
the mother of seven on her wedding day.

1433
01:50:01,558 --> 01:50:05,291
Simple family meals are something the
princess is determined to maintain.

1434
01:50:05,391 --> 01:50:08,166
She intends to supervise
all of the family cooking

1435
01:50:08,266 --> 01:50:12,125
and she's a regular and
welcome visitor to the kitchens.

1436
01:50:12,225 --> 01:50:14,416
The princess has
always loved country life.

1437
01:50:14,516 --> 01:50:16,291
She herself comes from Sussex

1438
01:50:16,391 --> 01:50:19,907
and she and the prince aim
to spend plenty of time in the open air.

1439
01:50:25,725 --> 01:50:29,791
The princess hopes to be a friend
to all sorts and conditions of men,

1440
01:50:29,891 --> 01:50:34,157
not least those less fortunate
and less gifted than herself.

1441
01:50:39,558 --> 01:50:41,958
Princess Diana is radiantly confident

1442
01:50:42,058 --> 01:50:44,291
that she can make
a real and meaningful contribution

1443
01:50:44,391 --> 01:50:48,250
to her new family
and to her new country.

1444
01:50:52,433 --> 01:50:54,000
We wish auguri

1445
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:55,916
- "good wishes" in her new language -

1446
01:50:56,016 --> 01:51:01,541
to a new Italian princess who will, to us,
always remain a British one as well.

1447
01:52:23,516 --> 01:52:26,791
- Are you all right, my darling?
- I'm fine.

1448
01:52:26,891 --> 01:52:28,875
Have you understood
what I said to Palucci?

1449
01:52:28,975 --> 01:52:33,208
- Enough.
- Well, I'm sorry, but I must go to Rome.

1450
01:52:33,308 --> 01:52:35,375
The bank meeting is tomorrow morning.

1451
01:52:35,475 --> 01:52:38,625
- And tonight?
- Oh, tonight...

1452
01:52:38,725 --> 01:52:41,750
I'll go and see my mother. You know
I must go and see my mother.

1453
01:52:41,850 --> 01:52:44,208
- Yes.
- Next time you must come with me.

1454
01:52:44,308 --> 01:52:47,083
- But just now, Rome is not amusing.
- Yes, I know.

1455
01:52:47,183 --> 01:52:50,416
- If you need anything, Palucci will...
- It's all right, I have plenty to do...

1456
01:52:50,516 --> 01:52:53,375
Look, I'll be back on Thursday.
Probably Friday...

1457
01:52:53,475 --> 01:52:56,250
So take care of yourself. Bye, darling.

1458
01:52:56,350 --> 01:52:58,532
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1459
01:53:29,266 --> 01:53:30,416
- Buona notte!
- Buona notte!

1460
01:53:30,516 --> 01:53:33,000
Buona notte! Good night!

1461
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:35,282
- Good night, signora.
- Good night.

1462
01:54:22,766 --> 01:54:26,199
I'll send the car for you
at 12 o' clock. Enjoy yourselves.

1463
01:54:36,766 --> 01:54:39,458
- My husband's mother...
- Yes, principessa.

1464
01:54:39,558 --> 01:54:41,208
Have you her phone number?

1465
01:54:41,308 --> 01:54:45,833
The principessa had the instrument
removed some years ago, principessa.

1466
01:54:45,933 --> 01:54:48,041
So my husband is not
attainable at all tonight, then?

1467
01:54:48,141 --> 01:54:50,833
One could send a telegram, principessa.

1468
01:54:50,933 --> 01:54:53,208
That's the only means whereby
you can get in contact?

1469
01:54:53,308 --> 01:54:56,541
That is so, principessa.

1470
01:54:56,641 --> 01:54:59,791
Thank you. Thank you, Signor Palucci.

1471
01:54:59,891 --> 01:55:01,657
Principessa.

1472
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,157
Grazie.

1473
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:36,666
- Are you resident in this country?
- No, in Italy.

1474
01:57:36,766 --> 01:57:38,416
Have you bought any presents
while you've been abroad?

1475
01:57:38,516 --> 01:57:39,791
No, nothing at all.
Just personal luggage.

1476
01:57:39,891 --> 01:57:42,958
- No perfume?
- No nothing at all.

1477
01:57:43,058 --> 01:57:44,291
You realise that perfume is dutiable?

1478
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:46,750
Yes, well I haven't got
any with me, anyway.

1479
01:57:46,850 --> 01:57:49,416
- No, no. It's just all personal.
- You bought nothing at all.

1480
01:57:49,516 --> 01:57:52,907
- No cigarettes or spirits?
- I've got nothing to declare.

1481
01:58:02,558 --> 01:58:06,240
Hello.

1482
01:58:08,808 --> 01:58:11,416
I didn't know whether you'd come.

1483
01:58:11,516 --> 01:58:13,699
I was always easily seduced.

1484
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:17,208
Especially by telegrams.

1485
01:58:17,308 --> 01:58:19,490
I hoped you would be.

1486
01:58:27,475 --> 01:58:30,699
- You look older.
- You don't.

1487
01:58:32,933 --> 01:58:35,115
Come on, I hate this anteroom.

1488
01:58:42,225 --> 01:58:43,740
Well...

1489
01:58:44,183 --> 01:58:45,699
Well?

1490
01:58:48,725 --> 01:58:51,791
Isn't it a miracle?

1491
01:58:51,891 --> 01:58:54,074
We're still a couple.

1492
01:58:57,558 --> 01:59:00,166
I thought maybe after all this time

1493
01:59:00,266 --> 01:59:03,541
something would have changed.

1494
01:59:03,641 --> 01:59:05,449
It hasn't.

1495
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:09,250
We are?

1496
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:11,532
Aren't we?

1497
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:17,949
Thank God it's never too late.

1498
01:59:19,516 --> 01:59:22,699
Two people really belong to each other.

1499
01:59:24,350 --> 01:59:26,541
It doesn't matter what happens.

1500
01:59:26,641 --> 01:59:29,375
This time, darling,
let's get somewhere in the country.

1501
01:59:29,475 --> 01:59:32,083
Away from all this London racket.

1502
01:59:32,183 --> 01:59:34,740
Somewhere quiet where you can write.

1503
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:41,208
We both learned our lesson and won't
make any more mistakes.

1504
01:59:41,308 --> 01:59:43,490
I know we can be so happy.

1505
01:59:45,016 --> 01:59:47,199
We're not going back
to anything, you know.

1506
01:59:49,225 --> 01:59:51,407
This was just for old times' sake.

1507
01:59:56,808 --> 01:59:59,083
Porter, please.

1508
01:59:59,183 --> 02:00:00,041
What are you doing?

1509
02:00:00,141 --> 02:00:01,916
Porter, will you get on
to London Airport

1510
02:00:02,016 --> 02:00:06,458
and reserve me one seat on
any flight this afternoon to Rome.

1511
02:00:06,558 --> 02:00:08,041
- That's right;
- What the hell are you doing?

1512
02:00:08,141 --> 02:00:10,833
The Princess Della Romita.

1513
02:00:10,933 --> 02:00:11,875
R-O-M...

1514
02:00:11,975 --> 02:00:16,750
Robert, put down that phone.
Give me that phone. What are you doing?

1515
02:00:16,850 --> 02:00:18,375
You are going back to Rome.

1516
02:00:18,475 --> 02:00:21,041
I am not going back.
I'll cancel it. Give me that phone.

1517
02:00:21,141 --> 02:00:24,365
Get up... and get dressed.

1518
02:00:25,391 --> 02:00:28,333
You bastard.

1519
02:00:28,433 --> 02:00:30,833
You just used me.

1520
02:00:30,933 --> 02:00:33,750
You used me. It's a moot point.

1521
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:36,032
Now, get dressed.

1522
02:00:39,141 --> 02:00:41,324
God, I hate you.

1523
02:00:45,516 --> 02:00:48,041
It is not true, Robert. I love you.

1524
02:00:48,141 --> 02:00:50,208
You know I love you.
What are you doing Robert?

1525
02:00:50,308 --> 02:00:51,541
Please. Please, I've come all this way.

1526
02:00:51,641 --> 02:00:53,865
Get dressed and I'll
take you to the airport.

1527
02:00:55,016 --> 02:00:58,208
Oh, Robert, come on. It's only 'cause
I love you. Don't throw it away.

1528
02:00:58,308 --> 02:01:00,333
I need you. Please...

1529
02:01:00,433 --> 02:01:04,166
Will you get dressed?

1530
02:01:04,266 --> 02:01:05,916
Robert...

1531
02:01:06,016 --> 02:01:09,791
Just give us one more chance.
I beg of you.

1532
02:01:09,891 --> 02:01:11,708
Let's spend a week together.

1533
02:01:11,808 --> 02:01:14,615
- It won't hurt to try a week.
- I don't have a week.

1534
02:01:18,725 --> 02:01:23,407
I...don't see how you can throw away
something that's meant so much to us.

1535
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:28,750
It doesn't put me off, you know.

1536
02:01:28,850 --> 02:01:32,250
Being vile to me doesn't put me off.

1537
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:34,291
It puts me off.

1538
02:01:34,391 --> 02:01:36,083
- It disgusts me.
- What does?

1539
02:01:36,183 --> 02:01:38,365
To hear myself.

1540
02:01:39,183 --> 02:01:41,365
To hear the way I want to treat you.

1541
02:01:41,933 --> 02:01:44,699
I won't feel like this
a moment longer than I have to.

1542
02:01:47,808 --> 02:01:50,416
But we can't just go like this.

1543
02:01:50,516 --> 02:01:52,500
You'd be surprised.

1544
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:55,458
You're in love with
someone else. Is that it?

1545
02:01:55,558 --> 02:01:57,791
No.

1546
02:01:57,891 --> 02:01:59,750
Gone back to your wife?

1547
02:01:59,850 --> 02:02:01,291
No, on the contrary...

1548
02:02:01,391 --> 02:02:03,708
She wants to divorce me. She's found
someone else she wants to marry.

1549
02:02:03,808 --> 02:02:06,958
- Well?
- Isn't that good news.

1550
02:02:07,058 --> 02:02:09,250
But if there isn't anyone else,
what are you going to do?

1551
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:12,083
- Why just...
- I'm going to a small American university.

1552
02:02:12,183 --> 02:02:14,666
I shall read, shall lecture...

1553
02:02:14,766 --> 02:02:16,791
You'll hate it.

1554
02:02:16,891 --> 02:02:20,125
...and I shall like it.
It's what I want to do. I shall write.

1555
02:02:20,225 --> 02:02:22,708
What will you write about?

1556
02:02:22,808 --> 02:02:25,541
I'll write about you.

1557
02:02:25,641 --> 02:02:28,625
About myself, about my wife,
and my children.

1558
02:02:28,725 --> 02:02:30,208
They played a large part, you know.

1559
02:02:30,308 --> 02:02:35,407
- I played the largest part.
- Certainly the most dramatic.

1560
02:02:39,475 --> 02:02:41,500
Robert, stop the car.

1561
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:43,458
I won't go to Rome.

1562
02:02:43,558 --> 02:02:45,875
- You're going to Rome.
- I'll kill myself.

1563
02:02:45,975 --> 02:02:48,041
- Then kill yourself.
- I will, I swear I will.

1564
02:02:48,141 --> 02:02:50,324
So do.

1565
02:02:51,766 --> 02:02:54,041
I didn't say I wanted to go with you.

1566
02:02:54,141 --> 02:02:57,625
If I can't be with you,
I don't want to be alive.

1567
02:02:57,725 --> 02:03:00,500
- Like hell.
- It's true.

1568
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:04,032
All lies are true at the time.

1569
02:03:47,975 --> 02:03:49,532
Porter.

1570
02:03:51,808 --> 02:03:53,365
Yes, ma'am?

1571
02:03:54,433 --> 02:03:57,657
My suitcase is in the back.

1572
02:04:16,183 --> 02:04:21,875
Announcing the arrival
of BOAC flight 262 from Lagos

1573
02:04:21,975 --> 02:04:24,157
and Frankfurt.

1574
02:04:26,508 --> 02:04:30,295
What actually is the
purpose of your visit here?

1575
02:04:30,395 --> 02:04:32,750
Don't know how you even
found out I was in England.

1576
02:04:32,850 --> 02:04:35,041
Any special reason?

1577
02:04:35,141 --> 02:04:38,041
My mother hasn't been very well.
I came over to see her.

1578
02:04:38,141 --> 02:04:40,000
No other reason?

1579
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:42,041
Isn't one's mother enough reason?

1580
02:04:42,141 --> 02:04:45,541
I see. Are you happy
in Italy, principessa?

1581
02:04:45,641 --> 02:04:48,125
I'm as happy as anyone
could possibly be.

1582
02:04:48,225 --> 02:04:52,375
Are you... likely to resume
your career soon, principessa?

1583
02:04:52,475 --> 02:04:56,115
I have a family now and that
gives me all I could possible want.
