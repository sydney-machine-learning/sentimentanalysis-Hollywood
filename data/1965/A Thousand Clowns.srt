1
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,474
Neighbors!

2
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,610
I have an announcement for you.

3
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:49,982
I have never seen such
a collection of dirty windows.

4
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:53,352
Now, I want to see all of you
out there on the fire escapes

5
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:57,523
with your Mr. clean bottles,
and let's snap it up!

6
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,192
Murray, do you have to shout
like that every morning?

7
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,261
Clears my head.

8
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,428
Say, Murray,

9
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,496
were you planning maybe today
to look for a job?

10
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,697
Do what?

11
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,132
Look for a job, Murray.

12
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,302
Murray

13
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,738
Murray, what did you
get me down here for?

14
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:14,540
I mean, I just...
Nick, what time is it?

15
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,808
It's about 7:20.

16
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,744
Look, Murray, now, I have to...

17
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:24,316
Nick, in a moment, you're
going to see a horrible thing.

18
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,318
What's that?

19
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,422
People going to work.

20
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,769
Gee, Murray, I hope
it's not gonna be a long visit

21
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:20,926
with the junkman today.

22
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,272
I have something
I have to discuss with you.

23
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,229
Junkman?

24
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:27,866
Perruccio here is a dealer
in obsolete structures.

25
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,435
Are you still getting a buck for this?

26
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,703
Half a buck?

27
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,438
Perruccio...

28
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,439
2 bits.

29
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,341
Deal.

30
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,911
Murray, not another eagle.

31
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,249
Nick... You can't have
too many eagles.

32
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,785
Hey, wait a minute.

33
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,520
Why did you follow me down here?

34
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,222
Why aren't you in school today?

35
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,690
Well, it's a holiday.

36
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,693
Yeah, it's Irving r. Feldman's
birthday, like you said.

37
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,628
No, Irving r. Feldman's
birthday

38
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,730
is my own personal national holiday.

39
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,866
I did not open it up for the public.

40
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,367
He is proprietor of perhaps

41
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,636
the most distinguished
kosher delicatessen

42
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:05,937
in our neighborhood,

43
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,440
and, as such, I hold the day
of his birth in reverence.

44
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,043
Well, you said you weren't gonna
look for work today

45
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,245
'cause it was
Irving r. Feldman's birthday,

46
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,414
so I figured I'd celebrate, too,
a little.

47
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,417
Don't kid me, Nick.

48
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,886
I thought you liked
that damn genius school.

49
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,989
I figured I'd better stick
with you today...

50
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:26,091
Something I got to discuss.

51
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,928
See, because it's this
special school for big brains,

52
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,131
they watch you
and take notes and make reports

53
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,300
and they smile at you a lot.

54
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,371
Murray, they're very nervous there.

55
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,108
And there was this composition
I wrote in creative writing

56
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,211
about the advantages
of unemployment insurance.

57
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,313
Why did you write about that?

58
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:49,514
It's on my mind.

59
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,416
And once they got my record out,

60
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:54,486
they started to notice what
they call "significant data."

61
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,889
Turns out they've been keeping
this file on me for a long time,

62
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,292
checking with
that child-welfare place...

63
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,427
Same place you got those letters from.

64
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,597
I never answer letters
from large organizations.

65
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,843
Well, anyway, when they come over there,

66
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,907
I just thought we could...

67
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,602
Wait a minute.
When who comes over where?

68
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,505
Our apartment.

69
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,906
This child-welfare crowd...

70
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,476
They want to take a look
at our environment there.

71
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,644
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

72
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,480
Well, you know,
the past couple of nights,

73
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,548
we couldn't get together.

74
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:23,782
That was unavoidable.

75
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,917
You know, when I have a lot of work,

76
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,386
you stay up at Mrs. Myers.

77
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,789
Murray, your work
forgot her gloves last night.

78
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,360
Well, anyway,
for these child-welfare guys,

79
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,362
I figure we'd better set up
some kind of a story

80
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,897
this morning before they get there.

81
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,166
You know, you make it sound
like a vice raid.

82
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,801
I mean, for one thing, Murray,

83
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,703
you don't even have a job right now.

84
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,004
Hey, have you ever been

85
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,240
to the top of the empire state building?

86
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,142
Four times with you in November.

87
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,676
Really?

88
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,112
Have you ever been
to the statue of Liberty?

89
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,547
No, Murray, I...

90
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,783
Today is
Irving r. Feldman's birthday.

91
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,552
We shall go to the top
of the statue of Liberty

92
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,721
and watch the<i> queen Elizabeth</i> come in,

93
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,690
full of all those tired,
poor, huddled masses

94
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,325
yearning to breathe free.

95
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,154
Murray, will you listen to me?!
We have to...

96
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,913
Murray, couldn't I just
read you from<i> the times</i> again,

97
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,582
like last week?

98
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:35,187
Okay, read me from the paper.

99
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,326
Hey, Murray,
this paper is three days old.

100
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,028
So, what do you want me to do, bury it?

101
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,596
Is it starting to rot or something?

102
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,064
Come on, read me from the paper.

103
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,434
Yeah, but most of these jobs,
somebody must have taken them.

104
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,936
I'll go get a newer paper.

105
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,971
No, we do not need a newer paper.

106
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,507
All the really important jobs
stay forever.

107
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:58,977
Now, start on the first page
of "help wanted... male"

108
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,779
and read me from the paper.

109
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:01,980
Okay.

110
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:07,586
"Exec-assist, ex-oppty,
$90 to top sal."

111
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,920
What's that?

112
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,557
Executive assistant,
excellent opportunity, nothing.

113
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,626
Keep reading.

114
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,396
Hey, here's a perfect one.

115
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,898
It says, "writer wanted."

116
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,367
"Writer/editor, industrial periodicals.

117
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,070
"To write handbooks, reports,
and promotion

118
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,605
on electronic equipment."

119
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,173
Say, what you got there, kid...

120
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:29,741
The want ads or the obituaries?

121
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:34,079
Okay, kid, read me some more want ads.

122
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,526
You know, Murray, you don't
want a job, is the whole thing.

123
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,695
Would you just concentrate
on being a child?

124
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,731
Because I find your imitation of
an adult hopelessly inadequate.

125
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,767
You want to be your own boss, Murray,

126
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,670
but the trouble with that is
you don't pay yourself anything.

127
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,639
You're not paying yourself anything.

128
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,375
Hey, that's a good line.
I got to remember that.

129
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,912
You ever consider being the
first 12-year-old boy in space?

130
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,815
Murray, I am upset.

131
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,850
Now, for me, as an actual child,

132
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,420
the way you live in this house
and we live

133
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,755
is a dangerous thing for my later life

134
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,757
when I become an actual person.

135
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,627
Now, an unemployed person,
like you are for so many months,

136
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,929
is bad for you as the person involved,

137
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,931
and it's definitely bad for me,

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,133
who he lives with in the same house

139
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,070
where the rent isn't paid up
for months sometimes,

140
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,339
and I wish you'd get a job, Murray!

141
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,913
Please!

142
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,920
You're absolutely right.

143
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,567
What's wrong, Murray?

144
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,471
I don't know, Nick.

145
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:42,941
Murray, are you all right?

146
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,585
Hey... I enjoyed
the statue of Liberty a lot.

147
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,554
Hey, it was great.
I'm glad we went.

148
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,393
Hey, it is a great view, isn't it?

149
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,162
Yeah.

150
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:07,499
Otto... Otto...

151
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,768
We have reached at last the mainland,

152
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,804
and we must now get the rocket
plans from agent x-22.

153
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,507
The French, you fool.

154
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,808
We is being observed.

155
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,110
It is essential we are not observed.

156
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,914
Hey, is you really
secret spy x-12?

157
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,082
I wouldn't tell you.

158
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,417
And why not?

159
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,985
Because it's a secret, you fool.

160
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,640
Hey, spy, listen,
I'll tell you something.

161
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,009
You know those poison capsules
they give us

162
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,343
to take when we get captured.

163
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,645
<i>Ja?</i>

164
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,658
I think I know how they're
giving them to us now, Otto.

165
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:56,815
What's that?

166
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,750
They're putting them
in the cracker Jacks.

167
00:11:58,819 --> 00:11:59,819
That... that's crazy.

168
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,586
That's a silly thing, what you said.

169
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,422
That's silly, that's silly.
That's a silly thing.

170
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,791
They are putting them in the

171
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,128
wait a second.

172
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:13,431
This... this is ridiculous.

173
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,267
They're putting the prize in the package!

174
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,237
It... Is... A killer.

175
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,972
Excuse me.

176
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,574
Are you Mr. burns?

177
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,976
Only for a couple more seconds, buddy.

178
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,411
They poisoned my cracker Jack.

179
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,413
Yes, I see.

180
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:31,716
You are
Murray n. Burns?

181
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,885
Excuse me.
How are you?

182
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,687
How do you do, Mr. burns?

183
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,891
I am Mr. amundson,
and this is miss markowitz.

184
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,094
Miss markowitz and I
are a social-service unit

185
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,096
from the child welfare board.

186
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,832
We have been asked by the bureau to...

187
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,468
And this must be young Nicholas.

188
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,103
Hello.

189
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,806
Mr. burns, we...
Miss markowitz and I

190
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,443
have been asked by the bcw
to investigate and examine

191
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:01,146
certain pupils of the revere school.

192
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:05,617
There's a... may we,
see you for a moment?

193
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,419
Certainly.

194
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,563
There is certain information

195
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,466
which the school and the city
would like to have,

196
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,334
regarding young Nicholas.

197
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,836
Here, won't you sit down.

198
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,405
I'll just get rid of these things.

199
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,143
I... I'd like to explain
just why we're here, Mr. burns.

200
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,746
Well, say,
would anybody like some coffee?

201
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,748
Well, thank you, Nicholas.

202
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:37,817
Miss markowitz?

203
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,951
Yes, thank you.

204
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,254
Watch it.

205
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,562
It might be best, Mr. burns,
for the child

206
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,364
if perhaps you were
to send him downstairs

207
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,568
to play or something
while we have our discussion.

208
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,103
Yes, it would be more advisable,
Mr. burns,

209
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,905
if the child were not present,

210
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,174
since miss markowitz will be discussing

211
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,542
the psychological area.

212
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,678
That is, we will be
discussing certain matters.

213
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,746
You gonna talk dirty?

214
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,450
I appreciate the, informality

215
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,720
with which you approach
this meeting, Mr. burns.

216
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,423
However, due to the fact
that you have chosen

217
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,860
not to answer our letters and
several of our phone calls...

218
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:25,330
Miss markowitz,
may I know your first name?

219
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,265
It's Sandra.

220
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:31,469
And you are the psychologist
part of the team, Sandy?

221
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,072
That's right, Mr. burns.

222
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,343
And you, sir, I take it,
are the brawn of the outfit.

223
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:41,112
Perhaps I-i should explain,
Mr. burns,

224
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:45,149
that the social-service teams
which serve the revere school

225
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,853
are a carefully planned
balance of social caseworkers,

226
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:52,223
such as myself and...
Thank you, Nicholas...

227
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,959
And a psychological social worker,

228
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:58,997
such as miss markowitz...
Or, actually, Dr. markowitz.

229
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,932
Together, we form a rather...

230
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,800
Say, is the coffee any good?

231
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,570
Yes, very good.
Thank you, Nicholas.

232
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,472
Very nice, Nicholas.

233
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,274
Nicholas, are you drinking coffee?

234
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,209
Don't you think it would be better...

235
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,044
No, it's milk.

236
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,713
I like to drink it from a cup.

237
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,849
Now, aren't you ashamed of yourself?

238
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,453
Mr. burns,
Mr. amundson and I

239
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,556
have several cases to examine today,

240
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:29,327
and we would appreciate
a certain amount of cooperation.

241
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:30,728
East Bronx, mosholu parkway.

242
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,797
And a couple of years
in maybe Massachusetts.

243
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:33,898
No!

244
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,434
Excuse me.

245
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:40,138
Nick and I are merely testing
our sense of voice and accent.

246
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,074
Nick insists
he is better at this than I am.

247
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,144
Actually, I took my graduate
work with a professor...

248
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,780
A man with a very strong
new england accent,

249
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,516
who could very well have
influenced my speech.

250
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,750
Nick is quite right.

251
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,086
Wow, thank you, lady.

252
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:58,156
You certainly have
a fine ear for sound, Nick.

253
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,958
Do you and your uncle play

254
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,527
many of these sorts of games together?

255
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,629
Well, yes, we play many wholesome

256
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,898
and constructive-type games
together.

257
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,401
You're a big phony, Nick.

258
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,871
This lady is here for the facts.

259
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,373
Quite so, Mr. burns.

260
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:19,777
We wish also to investigate
those intangibles, those...

261
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,179
Jersey city.

262
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,582
Maybe Newark and a little bit of Chicago.

263
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,250
Aha, I think you hit it, Nick!

264
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,553
Well, that's really quite remarkable!

265
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,255
Albert... Mr. amundson...
Is from New Jersey.

266
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,558
He went to the university of Chicago.

267
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,327
Sandra, this is really
quite beside the point.

268
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,297
But, Albert, I think
it's really quite remarkable!

269
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,499
Suppose I just plunge right in here

270
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,868
with several of the facts required.

271
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,783
The honeydew melon's in season,
but they're not really ripe,

272
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,240
so I figured that the cantaloupe...

273
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,975
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company.

274
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,143
See ya, Nick.

275
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,544
See ya, uncle Arnie.

276
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,616
There's somebody else
living here with you?

277
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,518
No, that's just my brother, Arnold.

278
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:03,121
He brings fruit every morning
on his way to the office.

279
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,255
He's a fruit nut.

280
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,591
Yes, I see in our files

281
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,961
that your brother acts as your agent.

282
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,896
Our research team spoke to him,
I believe.

283
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:15,666
Say... Do you really do
a lot of that stuff...

284
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,236
Calling people,
going into my personal life?

285
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,872
You've refused
for quite some time, Mr. burns,

286
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,174
to answer any of our regular inquiries.

287
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:26,477
We understand that you have been
unemployed, at this point,

288
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,912
for nearly five months...

289
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,548
Well, he has an excellent oppty
to be an exec-assist.

290
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,583
And that, previous to this,

291
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,152
you were the chief writer

292
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,554
for the "chuckles the chipmunk" show.

293
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:37,822
Right, Albert.

294
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,668
For three years,
I wrote scripts for Leo Herman,

295
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,492
better known as chuckles the chipmunk,

296
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,961
friend of the young'uns
and seller of chuckle chips,

297
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,297
the potato chips
your buddy chuckles the chipmunk

298
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,632
chomps on and chuckles over.

299
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,234
Would you care to describe
the circumstances

300
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,537
under which you left the employ of the...

301
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,305
I quit.

302
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,474
You felt that this was not
the work for you?

303
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,744
No, I felt that I wasn't
reaching all the boys and girls

304
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,679
out there in television land.

305
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,347
Actually, it was not so much

306
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,650
I wasn't reaching the boys and girls,

307
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,586
but the boys and girls
were starting to reach me.

308
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,622
Six months ago, a perfectly
adult bartender asked me

309
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,825
if I'd like an onion in my Martini,

310
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,427
and I said,
"gosh 'n' gollies, you betcha."

311
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:19,430
Well, I knew it was time to quit.

312
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,033
May I ask if this is a pattern?

313
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,267
That is, in the past,

314
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,603
has there been much shifting of position?

315
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,773
No, I always take an onion in my Martini.

316
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,875
This is a constant, and I...

317
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,045
Mr. burns,
perhaps you're not aware

318
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,548
of just how serious your situation is...

319
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,618
The circumstances
of the child's environment,

320
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:41,786
the danger of...

321
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,454
Our investigation,
Mr. burns...

322
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,223
substantial development and...

323
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,557
is the result

324
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:51,529
of what the bureau considers
to be almost an emergency case.

325
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,834
Yeah, but he just likes
to kid around, lady.

326
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,303
Really, we've got
a great environment here.

327
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,973
Relax, kid.

328
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,809
Look, people, I am sorry.

329
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,245
Let's get on with the questions.

330
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,514
Nick, suppose that you and I

331
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,216
have a little chat right here.

332
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,753
Fine, I was gonna suggest that myself.

333
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:23,895
Well, I'm sure there are times
when the fun stops

334
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,763
and you have nice talks

335
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,599
and your uncle teaches you things.

336
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,768
I can do a great Peter lorre imitation.

337
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,003
Murray taught me.

338
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,905
Nicky, what miss markowitz means...

339
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,040
You can't hang me.

340
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,875
Is that you and your uncle must...

341
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,310
I didn't do it, I tell you.

342
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,912
No, Nicky.
That's not my knife!

343
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,548
That's not what we mean.
It was all a mistake!

344
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,982
Nick...
I'm innocent!

345
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,250
I'm innocent!

346
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,019
Nicholas...
I...

347
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,188
That happens to be a very good imitation.

348
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,423
Well, perhaps,
but we're trying to establish...

349
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,358
Can you imitate Peter lorre?!

350
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,228
I can also do a pretty good James cagney.

351
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,597
I mean, it's not fantastic
like my Peter lorre,

352
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,765
now, Nicholas, please!

353
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,633
Try and pay attention.

354
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,669
Now, if I may proceed...

355
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:08,873
Albert, if you'll just
let me handle this area...

356
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,250
All right, Nick,
let's talk about games, okay?

357
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,484
Okay.

358
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,288
Now, do you have
any favorite games or toys

359
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,524
that you'd like to show me...

360
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:30,962
Some plaything that's just
the most favorite one of all?

361
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,332
There's bubbles.

362
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,901
I don't think you'd be
interested in seeing bubbles.

363
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:46,143
See, bubbles is what
you'd call an electric statue.

364
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,384
It's got an electric
battery timer in there

365
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,686
that makes it go on and off like that.

366
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,323
Is this your favorite toy, Nick?

367
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,759
Well, after a while,
it gets pretty boring.

368
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,995
Tell me, Nick, do you like best the fact

369
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,063
that the chest of the lady lights up?

370
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,298
Well, you got to admit,

371
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,333
you don't see boobies
like that every day.

372
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:12,603
Anybody want any toast
or orange juice or anything?

373
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,042
Say, would you want to see the effect

374
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,445
when the lights are out
and when the room is dark?

375
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:27,151
Tell me, Nick, is that what
you like best about it...

376
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,421
The fact that you can be alone
in the dark with it?

377
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,656
Well, I don't know,

378
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,392
but, in the dark,
they really knock your eye out.

379
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,062
Perhaps, don't you think
we ought to turn off...

380
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,766
Nick, does bubbles...
Does she in any way...

381
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,535
Does her face remind you at all

382
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:48,806
of, let me see,
your mother, for... for example?

383
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,241
No, it's just a doll.

384
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,710
It's not a statue of anybody I know.

385
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,812
I got it in a store downtown.

386
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,315
H-her chest...
Is that something...

387
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,251
Well, it's something,
all right, isn't it?

388
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,920
When you think about your mother...

389
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,955
I don't think about her too much.

390
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,924
But when you do think about her,

391
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,660
do you remember her face best
or her hands or...

392
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,096
I remember, she has a terrific laugh.

393
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,399
See, it's the kind of laugh
that, when she laughs,

394
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,168
it... Makes you laugh, too.

395
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:20,404
Of course, she overdoes that a lot.

396
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:23,908
But I mean, physically,
when you think of her, do you...

397
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,143
Well, when you see bubbles there,

398
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,779
and bubbles goes on and off like that...

399
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,248
Sandra, his mother's chest
did not light up.

400
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,920
Mark that down in the file, Albert.

401
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:40,358
Nicky, I wonder
if you would turn those off...

402
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:41,992
I mean, her off.

403
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,661
See, mainly, I like to read books

404
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,296
that are healthy, constructive,

405
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,231
and extremely educational for a person.

406
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,500
Don't push it, Nick.

407
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,002
He has no unusual fixations, Sandy.

408
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,872
I mean, he's no more
abnormally interested

409
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:58,075
in your bust
than Mr. amundson is.

410
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,911
Mr. burns, it is not necessary
to make that...

411
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,414
Of course, I might be wrong about that.

412
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,483
Our interest in that doll is...

413
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,619
Say, you really are interested
in that doll, Albert.

414
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,654
Our...
Our interest in the doll...

415
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,790
Well, I'd sell it to you for $2.

416
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:15,126
That's 50 cents less than I paid for it.

417
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,696
Sandra, I fail to see what's so amusing.

418
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:21,632
I'm sorry, Albert.

419
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,868
Well, it was just funny.

420
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,303
Suppose I pursue, then,

421
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,139
the psychological part
of this examination.

422
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,607
Really, Albert, I really do feel

423
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,308
that it would be better if I were to...

424
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,043
Look, Albert, the lady was just laughing

425
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:34,512
because something funny happened.

426
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,680
That's the best thing to do
under the circumstances.

427
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,149
Mr. burns...

428
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,985
Say! How would you all like
to go to the statue of Liberty?

429
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,421
Now, I have it on good authority
from the weather lady

430
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:46,557
that today is a beautiful day.

431
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:47,658
Mr. burns!

432
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,427
Now, this interview
has reached a point...

433
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,595
I-I'm gonna get
my educational books now.

434
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,364
I-I left them
out on the street.

435
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,833
Mr. burns, this interview
has reached a point...

436
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:57,001
Mr. burns...

437
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,736
Now, damn it, Sandra, don't interrupt me!

438
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:01,305
For goodness' sakes, Albert.

439
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:04,475
Sandra, perhaps we...

440
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:06,610
Would you excuse us
for a moment, Mr. burns?

441
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,813
I'd like to have a short
conference with Sandra...

442
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:13,350
Mi... Dr. markowitz...
For a moment, please.

443
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,689
Dear, what are you doing?

444
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,291
Have we lost all control?

445
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,594
Are you seriously talking to me
about control, Albert?

446
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,196
Now, dear, I told you...

447
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,134
I told you,
and I told Dr. malko,

448
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:33,704
it is much too soon for you
to be going out on cases.

449
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:37,341
You need another year
in the office, behind the lines.

450
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,277
I told you both.
You simply are not ready.

451
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,980
Albert, you hardly let me get started.

452
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:47,051
See, I was attempting to deal
on the basis of the whole child.

453
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,399
Three months out of grad school,

454
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,199
and you want to go
right into the front lines.

455
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:51,255
Really.

456
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,556
You get too involved, Sandra.

457
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:56,260
Each case, you get
much too emotionally involved.

458
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,662
Now, we are scientists, dear.

459
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,464
You seem to lose sight of that fact.

460
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,867
Albert, this is no way to deal
with this man's problem.

461
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,035
That's fine, that's fine.

462
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,203
How are we doing?

463
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,640
You know, personally, I don't think

464
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:12,243
you're going to solve
your problems with each other,

465
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:15,713
but I'm glad you came to me,
because I think I can help you.

466
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:18,382
Al, Sandy is not going to respect you

467
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:19,984
because you threaten her.

468
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,586
No, respect will have to come gradually,

469
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:24,655
naturally, a maturing process.

470
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,991
Mr. burns,
the child welfare board

471
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,494
is thoroughly aware that
Nicholas is not legally adopted.

472
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,031
Consequently, they have, I assure you...

473
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,667
Now, you don't assure me
of anything, buddy.

474
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:38,168
You make me damn nervous.

475
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,571
Mr. burns,
according to the bcw,

476
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,173
the child's continuance in your home

477
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,743
is in serious and immediate doubt.

478
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:56,253
Burns, aren't you at all willing
to give some evidence

479
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:59,023
in your favor for our report...

480
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:03,193
Some evidence to support
your competency as a guardian?

481
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,802
All right, Albert.

482
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:27,551
Look, folks, what's all the trouble?

483
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,919
Nick is my nephew.

484
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:31,655
He's staying with me
for a while. He's visiting.

485
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,457
How long has he been here?

486
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:34,992
Seven years.

487
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,831
Nicholas' father...
Where is he?

488
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,334
Well, that's not a "where" question?

489
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,935
That's a "who" question.

490
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:48,872
N-Nicholas' mother...
She is still alive?

491
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:52,509
My sister is unquestionably alive.

492
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,945
But her responsibility to the child...

493
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,580
Well, now, for five years,

494
00:26:56,649 --> 00:27:00,184
she did everything she could
for the child but get married.

495
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,952
Now, that's not easy to understand,

496
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,355
since she used to get married
to everybody.

497
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,490
You might call Nick a bastard...

498
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,791
Or a little bastard,

499
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,861
depending upon how whimsical
you feel at the time.

500
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,631
I tell ya, folks,

501
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:16,834
I got a real social worker's
paradise here.

502
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:20,838
Well, my sister Elaine
arrived here one day

503
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:24,808
with two suitcases, a hatbox,
a blue parakeet,

504
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:28,312
a dead goldfish,
and a 5-year-old child.

505
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:29,847
A few days later,

506
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:34,551
she went downstairs to buy
a pack of filter-tip cigarettes.

507
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,786
Six years later,

508
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,856
she returned for the suitcases
and the hatbox.

509
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,258
Now, the parakeet, I'd given away.

510
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,862
The goldfish, I had long since
flushed down the toilet.

511
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,432
And the 5-year-old child
had, with very little effort,

512
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,900
become 6 years older.

513
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,770
When Elaine returned for her luggage,

514
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,705
I reminded her of the child

515
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:57,508
and the fact
of filter-tip cigarettes.

516
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:03,213
And then, I don't know,
I slapped my sister.

517
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,982
Sister cried at some length

518
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:08,385
and then proceeded calmly,
briefly, to explain to me

519
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:11,689
her well-practiced theory
on the meaning of life...

520
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:15,192
A philosophy falling somewhere
to the left of whoopee.

521
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:19,897
Well, that was almost a year
ago, and I still got Nick.

522
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:24,134
But, I am sure she
must have had some concern

523
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,304
about Nicholas...
About the child.

524
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,040
His name is not Nicholas or even Nick.

525
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:32,609
You see, not having given him
a last name,

526
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:35,713
Elaine felt reticent
about assigning him a first one.

527
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:38,916
How did you communicate with...

528
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,485
I made a deal with him when he was 6,

529
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:45,155
up to which time he was known
rather casually as chubby,

530
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,991
that he could use
whatever name he wished,

531
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,428
for however long he wished,
until his 13th birthday,

532
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:55,165
at which time he'd have to pick
a name he liked permanently.

533
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,736
Now, he went through
a long period of dogs' names

534
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,270
when he was little,

535
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:04,007
king and rover having
a real vogue there for a while.

536
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:09,446
For three months, he referred
to himself as big Sam.

537
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:15,319
Then there was little Max,
snoopy, chip, rock, Rex, Mike,

538
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,888
Marty, lamont, che...

539
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:27,364
Chevrolet, woodrow, lefty, the phantom.

540
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,334
He received his library card last year

541
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,903
in the name of Raphael sabatini.

542
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:37,241
His cub scout membership lists
him as Dr. Morris fishbein.

543
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,144
Nick seems to be the one
that'll stick, though.

544
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:41,879
His mother... where...

545
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,415
Elaine communicates
with my brother and myself

546
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,351
almost entirely by rumor.

547
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:52,723
Well, I don't
think I've left anything out.

548
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:56,426
I was not aware that Nicholas
was an o.W. Child.

549
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,928
O.W.?

550
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,464
Out of wedlock.

551
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:03,700
For a moment there, I thought
you meant "prisoner of war."

552
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,570
I think it's that natural warmth
of yours, Albert,

553
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,505
that leads me to misunderstand.

554
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:12,843
Yes, but, as concerns the child...

555
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,044
Where is the child?

556
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:16,814
You preferred not having him
here anyway, Albert.

557
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,382
I'm perfectly aware, Sandra,

558
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,884
of what I prefer
and what I do not prefer.

559
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:26,056
I don't care for that tone
of voice at all, Albert.

560
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,962
Sandra, I understand perfectly
what has happened here.

561
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,498
We have allowed this man to disturb us,

562
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,867
and we have both gotten a bit upset.

563
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,569
Now, I really do feel that it's time

564
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:42,306
we got over to that family
problem in queens.

565
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,808
It's there in your file...
The ledbetters...

566
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,276
The introverted child.

567
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,879
We've given an unreasonable
amount of time to this case.

568
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,914
This interview,
I'm afraid, Mr. burns...

569
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:53,750
Albert, I personally feel
that it would not be advisable

570
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:56,486
to leave this particular case
at this particular time.

571
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,422
Sandra, we have done here this morning...

572
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,924
I feel that we've not really
given Mr. burns a chance.

573
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,660
Sandra...
It's time we left for queens.

574
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,133
Here's the ledbetter file.

575
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,902
I'm staying here.

576
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:14,472
Sandra...

577
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,241
I've decided to pursue this case.

578
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,310
Have we lost all professional control?

579
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:24,381
You just go yourself to the leadbellies.

580
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,652
You... Go on to queens,
why don't you?

581
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,822
May I just talk to you
for a moment, please?

582
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,326
Dear, what is this?

583
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,828
What's happened to you today?

584
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,029
What are you doing?

585
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:41,064
I am doing what I think is right.

586
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,901
I understand how you feel,
but there's nothing...

587
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,970
Are you really going to leave
that man here like that?

588
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,872
You're not going to try to help him

589
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:51,808
or tell him about the board
separating him from the child?

590
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:52,943
I mean, just so cold.

591
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:55,345
Darling, of course I want to help,

592
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,813
but, let's not forget,

593
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:59,950
the child is the one
who needs our protection.

594
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:02,152
Listen, you have...
You have spent too much time

595
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,755
in that graduate school and
not enough time in the field.

596
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,256
You've got to learn your job.

597
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:07,991
Don't give me any of that nonsense.

598
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,093
This is not the time
nor the place for this.

599
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,763
You know, graduate school
wouldn't have done you any harm,

600
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:13,931
believe me.

601
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,767
That's the most terrible thing!

602
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,402
Do you know what you are, Albert?

603
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,004
You're...

604
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,440
I don't know,
but I'll think of something.

605
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:27,778
Mr. burns...
Mr. burns, you can assume...

606
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,947
Mr. burns?

607
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,354
Mr. burns...

608
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,523
You can assume, at this point,

609
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:43,160
that miss markowitz is no longer
involved with your case.

610
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,429
Now, the board will be informed

611
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:49,132
that she's no longer involved
with this particular case.

612
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:52,703
And her continuing to discuss
your case at this point

613
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,571
is entirely unofficial.

614
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,808
You can dismiss any, conference

615
00:32:57,876 --> 00:33:02,145
which may resume when I leave...
A-after I leave here...

616
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,748
From your mind.

617
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,784
And regardless of what you think of me...

618
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,454
I think
you're a dirty o.W.

619
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:19,329
And do you know what you are?

620
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,898
Maladjusted.

621
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,467
Ew!

622
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,638
Good afternoon, Mr. burns.

623
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,741
Good afternoon, Sandra.

624
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,956
Mr. burns?

625
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:54,197
Mr. burns,
I must apologize to you.

626
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:57,267
We...

627
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,036
We have put you...

628
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:03,206
You have been put at
a disadvantage this morning...

629
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,541
Mr. burns,

630
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,078
because you've been involved
in a personal problem...

631
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:11,615
That has, nothing whatsoever to do

632
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:15,152
with your, particular case.

633
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,789
It's entirely wrong for me
to give you this impression

634
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:21,291
of our,

635
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,563
do you know what?

636
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:27,864
What?

637
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:30,367
I hate the ledbetters!

638
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,915
I'm sure, once I got to know
them, I'd hate them, too.

639
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,373
Mr. burns,
you don't understand.

640
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:38,241
Some of the cases, I love.

641
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,077
And some of them, I hate.

642
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,612
And that's all wrong for my work.

643
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,448
But I can't help it.

644
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:48,952
I hate Raymond ledbetter,
and he's only 9 years old.

645
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:52,489
But some of them...
Some of them, I like too much,

646
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:55,125
and I worry about them all day long.

647
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:56,893
It is an obvious conflict

648
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,496
against all professional standards.

649
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:03,800
I didn't like Raymond ledbetter,
so I tried to understand him.

650
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,903
And now that I understand him,
I hate him.

651
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:14,411
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

652
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,248
Albert is gone, and I just lost my job.

653
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:22,385
I wrote out what my married name
would be...

654
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:26,756
On a paper napkin
last night after dinner...

655
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:31,595
Mrs. Albert amundson...
To see how it would look.

656
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,633
We were going to be married.

657
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:39,469
It was all planned.

658
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:44,474
Mrs. Albert amundson
on a napkin.

659
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:48,478
You have to understand Albert.

660
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:52,449
He's really a very nice person
when he's not on cases.

661
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:56,453
He's a very intelligent man.

662
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,955
Last month, I fell asleep on him twice

663
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:01,191
while he was talking to me.

664
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,426
Do you have to sit there?

665
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,428
Please go away.

666
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:10,967
Why don't you go away?

667
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:12,502
But I live here.

668
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:15,739
I would like everybody to go away.

669
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:18,575
Could I get you a pastrami sandwich?

670
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:20,210
I don't even know you!

671
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,779
I am crying right in front of you!

672
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,748
Please go away!

673
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:29,886
Now, you're really going to
have to stop crying,

674
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:32,088
because I'm going out of my mind here.

675
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:33,390
I cry all the time,

676
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,359
and I laugh in the wrong places
in the movie.

677
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,697
I am unsuited to my profession.

678
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:42,566
I can't do anything right.

679
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,468
Last night, I burned an entire chicken.

680
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,671
And after seven years of school,

681
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,440
I can't work,
and I've got no place to go.

682
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,541
An entire chicken.

683
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:56,179
This is an awful day.

684
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:58,415
What am I going to do?

685
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:03,286
Miss markowitz, this is a beautiful day.

686
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:05,488
And I'll tell you why.

687
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:10,227
You're really a jolly old girl,
and you are well rid of Albert.

688
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,195
You have been given the rare opportunity

689
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:15,999
of returning the unused portion
and having your money refunded.

690
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:20,470
But my work...
What am I going to do?

691
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,673
But you're a lover,
Dr. markowitz.

692
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:27,577
You are a lover of things and of people,

693
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:30,046
so you took up work
where you could get at

694
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:31,648
as many of them as possible,

695
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:34,517
and it just turned out
there were too many of them

696
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,420
and too much that moves you.

697
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,723
But, damn it, be glad it turned out

698
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,025
you're not reasonable and sensible.

699
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:45,095
Have all the gratitude you can
that you're capable

700
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:49,399
of embarrassment and joy
and are a marathon crier.

701
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:53,803
There is a kind of relief
that it's gone...

702
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,705
The job and even Albert.

703
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,174
But I know what it is.

704
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,410
It's just irresponsible, that's all,

705
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,879
and I don't have
the vaguest idea who I am.

706
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,782
It's just that there are
all these sandras running around

707
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,250
who you've never met before,

708
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:10,587
and it's confusing, at first, fantastic.

709
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:13,189
But, damn it, isn't it great to find out

710
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,858
how many sandras there are?

711
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:18,094
It's like those little cars
in the circus, you know.

712
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:22,098
This tiny, red car comes out,
hardly big enough for a midget,

713
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,467
and it putters around.

714
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:27,904
And, suddenly, its doors open,

715
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,473
and out come a thousand clowns

716
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,343
whooping and hollering and raising hell.

717
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:41,452
What's this?

718
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,820
That is my undershirt.

719
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:47,757
Now, how's about going to the
empire state building with me?

720
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,659
I'll have that coffee now.

721
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:53,296
Didn't answer my question. Would you
like to visit the empire state building?

722
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:55,665
No, not really.

723
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,901
Well, then, how about the zoo?

724
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,703
Not just now.

725
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,237
Well, then, will you marry me?

726
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:03,474
What?

727
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,408
Just a bit of shock treatment there.

728
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,310
I have found, after long experience,

729
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,713
it's the quickest way
to get a woman's attention

730
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:10,847
when her mind wanders.

731
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:11,916
Always works.

732
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,184
Mr. burns...

733
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,453
No, no, now that you've cried,

734
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,388
you can't call me
Mr. burns.

735
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:21,157
Same thing goes for laughing.

736
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,359
My name is Murray.

737
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:25,762
Well, Murray,

738
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,864
to sort of return to reality
for a moment...

739
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:31,234
I'll only go as a tourist.

740
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:35,138
Murray...
The child welfare board

741
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,773
could really take Nick away,

742
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:39,342
but there's some things
that you could do about it

743
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:41,311
to make your case a little stronger.

744
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,814
Sandra, do you realize
you are not wearing your shoes?

745
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:53,156
Well, here I am with
some of my favorite books...

746
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,558
"fun in the rain,"
"the young railroader,"

747
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,794
"great philosophers,"
"science for youth,"

748
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:59,095
and a Spanish dictionary.

749
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:01,798
I left them out on the street
when I was playing, and I...

750
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:04,300
Nick, you just killed a whole
month's allowance for nothing.

751
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:07,303
Miss markowitz
isn't even on our case anymore.

752
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,206
I shouldn't have left.

753
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:12,509
You got angry and insulted everybody.

754
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,544
Nothing to worry about.

755
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:18,448
Well, $4 right out the window.

756
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,286
We're in real trouble now, right, lady?

757
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:26,222
Nick! Nick!

758
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,192
We have a guest...
A music lover.

759
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:32,262
Let us play our song.

760
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,165
Come on, I'm sure it'll be requested.

761
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,600
Murray, you know, we can't play
songs at a time like this.

762
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,836
Come on, old man, where's
your professional attitude?

763
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:42,772
This is no time to play songs.

764
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:50,173
Nice to meet you, lady.
I'll see you around.

765
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:51,441
Where you off to, Nick?

766
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,643
I'm gonna leave my stuff
over at Mrs. Myers.

767
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,912
See, I figure I'll be
staying up there tonight.

768
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:22,839
Murray, who do you know
who's leaving on that boat?

769
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:25,074
Nobody.
I don't get jealous that way.

770
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,143
Hey, atta way to go, Charlie baby!

771
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,278
Have a great trip!

772
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:29,512
Bon voyage, Charlie!

773
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:31,614
That's the way!
Have a good trip!

774
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:33,716
You see, it's a great thing to do

775
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,219
when you're about to start something new.

776
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:37,420
You see a boat off.

777
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:41,357
It gives you the genuine feeling
of a beginning.

778
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:45,328
Hey, bon voyage, Charlie!
Have a wonderful time!

779
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:48,965
Bon voyage, Charlie!
Have a wonderful time!

780
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:51,234
Bon voyage, Charlie!

781
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:52,535
Have a wonderful time!

782
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:53,803
Have a wonderful time!

783
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:41,584
Wall street...
The lovely view!

784
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:43,519
The hell with the view.

785
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:48,091
Right now, at this hour,
it's just me and all that money.

786
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:53,162
Right now, I'm all alone with $2 billion

787
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:56,466
in cash, checks, and securities.

788
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:58,234
And me.

789
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,636
I'm here, too.

790
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:03,840
Yes, you are, lady.

791
00:44:53,658 --> 00:44:55,892
Light.

792
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:08,504
No matter what time of day
or what season,

793
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:10,840
I got a permanent picture out there...

794
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,775
Twilight in February.

795
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:14,077
One of these mornings,

796
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:16,145
I'll wake up and that damn building

797
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,347
will have fallen down into 7th Avenue

798
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,782
so I can see the weather.

799
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:24,587
Using a machine
to call up another machine.

800
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:27,990
I do not enjoy the company of ghosts.

801
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:32,095
Hello, weather lady.

802
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:34,997
Well, I'm fine, and how's your
nasal little self this morning?

803
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,966
What's the weather?

804
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:39,368
That high?

805
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:40,737
And the wind?

806
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:43,139
Which way does the wind blow
this morning?

807
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,374
Very good.

808
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,777
All the way from eastport
to block island?

809
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:51,247
<i>Chance</i> of showers?

810
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:53,549
Hey, what exactly does that mean?

811
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:57,053
There you go again.

812
00:45:57,122 --> 00:45:59,088
You simply must learn
not to repeat yourself.

813
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:01,691
I keep telling you every morning
that once is enough.

814
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,526
Well, you'll never learn.

815
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,995
<i>Chance</i> of showers?

816
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:12,502
Hello, is this someone
with good news or money?

817
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,270
No? Goodbye.

818
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:21,811
This is your neighbor speaking.

819
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,013
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say

820
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:26,649
that something must be done
about your garbage cans

821
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:27,984
in the alley here.

822
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:30,686
It is definitely
second-rate garbage!

823
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:35,091
Now, by next week, I want to see
a better class of garbage...

824
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,961
More empty champagne bottles
and caviar cans!

825
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,097
I'm sure you're all behind me on this,

826
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:45,334
so let's snap it up and get on the ball!

827
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:56,179
Good morning.

828
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,649
Good morning.

829
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:01,818
How are you this morning?

830
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:04,720
I am fine this morning.
How are you?

831
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,756
I am fine, also.

832
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:11,427
Do you have a bathrobe?

833
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:12,929
Yes, I have a bathrobe.

834
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,598
May I have your bathrobe, please?

835
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:19,702
Well, I'll get you Nick's.
It'll fit you better.

836
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:22,238
Sounds like a good idea.

837
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:23,773
There you go.

838
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:25,808
Thank you.

839
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,785
It's 11:15, and there is
a<i> chance</i> of showers.

840
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:42,692
Does the bathrobe fit?

841
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,194
This bathrobe fits fine.

842
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:51,934
Did you happen to see my clothes?

843
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:56,138
They're in the bathroom.
Shall I get them?

844
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,940
No, thank you.

845
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:05,281
This isn't the bathroom.
This is the kitchen.

846
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,350
Here are your clothes,

847
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:10,620
also toothpaste and a toothbrush.

848
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:12,655
Thank you!

849
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:15,725
Morning, Murray.

850
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:17,026
Good morning, Arnold.

851
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:21,530
Say, Murray...

852
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,200
Chuckles called me again yesterday,

853
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:27,570
and I told him
I would talk to you, that's all.

854
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:29,839
Jimmy Sloan's in from the coast.

855
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:32,942
He's putting a new
panel-show package together.

856
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:36,245
You know, Arnold, you have
many successful clients.

857
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:39,026
With all these successful people around,

858
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,850
where are all of our new, young failures

859
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:42,685
going to come from?

860
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:45,121
Murray, those people
I saw here yesterday...

861
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:47,623
They were from the...
From the welfare board.

862
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:49,558
Is that right?
I tried to warn you.

863
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:51,260
There's nothing to worry about.

864
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,062
What are you saying, nothing to worry?

865
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:55,331
The welfare people don't
kid around. Now, do they?

866
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,466
Arnold, I don't mind you
coming here with fruit

867
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:58,668
if you'll keep quiet,

868
00:48:58,736 --> 00:49:00,503
but you bring a word with every apple.

869
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,907
Is Nick all right?

870
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:06,809
Now, everything's okay.

871
00:49:06,878 --> 00:49:08,411
Bye, Murray.

872
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:10,012
Bye, Arnold.

873
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,071
You know, yesterday was the first time

874
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,974
that I'd ever visited
the statue of Liberty.

875
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:41,143
Funny how you can live
in a city for so long

876
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:44,714
and not visit one of
its most fascinating sights.

877
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,818
Yes, that is funny.

878
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:14,477
This coffee isn't bad
for yesterday's coffee.

879
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,980
I think it's very good
for yesterday's coffee.

880
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:31,060
Good to the last drop.

881
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:32,795
That's right.

882
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,903
I have to go now.

883
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,507
Yes.

884
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:47,343
I have to be on my way.

885
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,347
Well, don't forget your file.

886
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:54,116
My file.

887
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:03,292
Bye.

888
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:04,994
Goodbye.

889
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,006
You crazy nut!
I was ready to kill ya!

890
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:18,974
What happened?
You didn't say anything.

891
00:51:19,043 --> 00:51:21,577
Well, I didn't know
what was going on. I...

892
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:22,711
Don't let me go!

893
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,682
I'm just putting my coffee cup down here.

894
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,618
Murray, I thought about it...

895
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,221
And I probably love you.

896
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,557
That's very romantic.

897
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:40,162
I probably love you, too.

898
00:54:07,979 --> 00:54:09,111
Rah!

899
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,380
We'll have to do something
about curtains.

900
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:13,082
We need color there, Murray.

901
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:16,051
I hope you didn't mind about
the screen around the bed.

902
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,887
I think it gives such
a nice separate-bedroom effect

903
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,256
to that part of the room.

904
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,358
There's so many wonderful things

905
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:25,561
you can do with
a one-room apartment, really,

906
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,264
if you're willing to use
your imagination.

907
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,202
Do you have an extra key?

908
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,637
A what?

909
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:38,173
An extra key. Altman's has
this terrific curtain sale.

910
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:39,441
Sure, a key.

911
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,678
I thought I would go over and...

912
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:45,014
Hey, you know what, Sandy?

913
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:47,983
I don't seem to have one...
An extra key.

914
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:55,891
You better answer that, Murray.

915
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,661
You, sure you don't prefer to...

916
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:01,997
No, I have no reason to hide
from anybody.

917
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:04,667
Aha.

918
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:09,338
Good morning, Mr. burns.

919
00:55:14,779 --> 00:55:16,278
How are you?

920
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:17,613
May I come in?

921
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:18,881
Sure.

922
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:25,354
I... I called you this morning,
Mr. burns.

923
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:27,289
That was you?

924
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:28,757
That was me.

925
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:32,428
Miss markowitz did not show up
in queens yesterday.

926
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,729
So?

927
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:36,732
Well, her parents are quite upset.

928
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:39,468
I am quite upset.

929
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:40,969
Where is she?

930
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:42,538
She's hiding in the closet.

931
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:47,643
Now, we're really all quite
anxious to know where she is.

932
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:52,481
I'm not kidding, Albert.
She's in the closet.

933
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:13,135
She<i> is</i> in the closet.

934
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,604
I wouldn't lie to you, Albert.

935
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,541
Why is she in the closet?

936
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,143
I don't know.

937
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:24,947
She's got this thing about closets.

938
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:28,117
Well, that's a very silly thing
for her to be in...

939
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:29,451
That closet.

940
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,554
Well, don't knock it until you tried it.

941
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:35,824
Now, what else can I do for you, Albert?

942
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,927
That's a difficult thing
for me to believe.

943
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:42,698
I mean, that she's
right there in the closet.

944
00:56:42,767 --> 00:56:45,567
You know, you are not a person,
Mr. burns.

945
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:47,069
You are an experience.

946
00:56:47,138 --> 00:56:49,471
That's very nice, Albert.

947
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,974
I'll have to remember that.

948
00:56:56,247 --> 00:57:01,016
Actually, Dr. markowitz is not
the reason for my visit today.

949
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,719
I came here in an official capacity.

950
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:05,754
Coffee?

951
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:07,089
No, thank you.

952
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:26,475
Now, what's on your mind, Albert?

953
00:57:30,314 --> 00:57:32,381
Burns...

954
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:35,017
Late yesterday afternoon,

955
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:39,688
the child welfare board
made a decision on your case.

956
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:42,925
Now, the decision they've reached

957
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:46,728
is based on three months
of a thorough study.

958
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:50,365
Our interview yesterday
was only a small part of that.

959
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:52,801
Quite thorough.

960
00:57:55,906 --> 00:57:58,807
I want you to understand that
I am not responsible personally

961
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:00,609
for the decision they've reached.

962
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:01,777
Now, look, Albert...

963
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:04,079
Months of research by the board

964
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:06,548
and reports by the revere school

965
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:09,218
show a severe domestic instability,

966
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:11,220
a libertine self-indulgence,

967
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:13,555
a whole range of circumstances

968
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:16,758
severely detrimental
to the child's welfare.

969
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,695
Hey, stop tap-dancing
a second, Albert.

970
00:58:19,763 --> 00:58:22,064
Now, what's going on?

971
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:25,067
Well, it is the board's decision
that you are unfit

972
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:27,135
to be the guardian of your nephew

973
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,404
and that action be taken this Friday

974
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:31,039
to remove him from this home

975
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:34,810
and the deprivation you cause him.

976
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:38,080
Who writes your material
for you... Charles dickens?

977
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:43,051
The board is prepared to find
a more stable, permanent home

978
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,753
for your nephew...

979
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:48,457
A family with whom he will live
a more wholesome, normal life.

980
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:52,461
Hey, listen, Albert, isn't there
some kind of a hearing?

981
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,631
Well, yes, you will have
the opportunity Thursday

982
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,866
to state your case to the board.

983
00:58:57,935 --> 00:59:00,536
Now, if there is some substantial change

984
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:02,004
in your circumstances,

985
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:03,472
if you can demonstrate

986
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,508
that you are a responsible
member of society...

987
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:07,776
Well, this is Tuesday.

988
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:10,312
What the hell am I supposed
to do in the next two days,

989
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:11,680
win the nobel peace prize?

990
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:17,753
You were to be informed
by the court, but...

991
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:20,522
In view of the confusion
which took place here yesterday,

992
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,691
for which I consider
myself responsible...

993
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,720
You know, you speak
like you write everything down

994
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:25,994
before you say it.

995
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:31,567
Well, yes,
I do speak that way, Mr. burns.

996
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:34,703
I wish I spoke more spontaneously.

997
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,740
I will always appear foolish
in a conversation

998
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,742
with a person of your imagination.

999
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:48,150
Please, understand there is no
vengeance in my activities here.

1000
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,752
I love my work, Mr. burns.

1001
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:53,889
Now, I believe that
you are a danger to this child.

1002
00:59:54,959 --> 00:59:57,059
Now, I wish this were not true,

1003
00:59:57,127 --> 01:00:00,395
because it is obvious
you have considerable affection

1004
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:01,663
for your nephew.

1005
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:05,434
It shows in your face, this feeling.

1006
01:00:05,502 --> 01:00:09,271
Well, I admire you
for your warmth, Mr. burns,

1007
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,140
and for the affection
the child feels for you.

1008
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:14,376
I admire this because...

1009
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:19,381
I am one for whom children
do not easily feel affection.

1010
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:23,518
I am not one of the warm people.

1011
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:25,988
But your feeling for the child

1012
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:30,258
does not mollify the genuinely
dangerous emotional climate

1013
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:31,960
you have made for him.

1014
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:34,329
Now, I wish you could understand this.

1015
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:36,798
I would so much rather you understood,

1016
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:39,234
could really hear what I have to say.

1017
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:40,602
For yours is, I believe,

1018
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:43,705
a distorted picture of this world.

1019
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:48,710
Then, why don't you send<i> me</i>
to a foster home?

1020
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:53,482
I was right.
You really can't listen to me.

1021
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,251
You're so sure of your sight.

1022
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:01,189
Your villains and heroes are
all so terribly clear to you,

1023
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:04,526
and I am obviously one of the villains.

1024
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:12,100
Well, god save you
from your vision, Mr. burns.

1025
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:22,344
Goodbye.

1026
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:38,527
Hey!

1027
01:01:38,595 --> 01:01:40,796
I'll bet you don't believe
I really do live

1028
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,065
above an abandoned Chinese restaurant?

1029
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,900
Come on, I'll show it to you.

1030
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,968
Murray?
Don't be nervous, lady.

1031
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,038
You're at an awkward stage.
You're between closets.

1032
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:52,307
Murray, what Albert said about Nick...

1033
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,976
Now, look, Sandy, to tell you the truth,

1034
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,645
it's even better for me if he goes.

1035
01:01:56,714 --> 01:01:58,613
I mean,
he's a middle-aged kid.

1036
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:03,485
You know, when I signed
with the network that time,

1037
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:05,787
he sat up all night
figuring out the fringe benefits

1038
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:08,023
and the pension plan.

1039
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:11,793
And he started to make lists this year.

1040
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:14,296
Lists of everything!

1041
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:16,364
Subway stops, underwear,

1042
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:18,633
"what are you gonna do
next week?"

1043
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:20,068
If somebody doesn't watch out,

1044
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:22,337
he'll start making lists of what
he's gonna do next year

1045
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:23,572
and for the next 10 years.

1046
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:28,944
Hey, suppose they put him in

1047
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:32,914
with a whole family of list makers!

1048
01:02:32,983 --> 01:02:35,584
No, no, I didn't spend six years with him

1049
01:02:35,652 --> 01:02:37,719
so he'd turn into a list maker.

1050
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:40,856
He'll learn to know everything
<i>before</i> it happens.

1051
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:43,358
He'll learn how to plan,

1052
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:47,963
learn how to be
one of the nice dead people.

1053
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:49,131
Are you listening to me?

1054
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:50,632
Of course, Murray, I told...

1055
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:53,101
Well, stamp your foot
or mutter or something

1056
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,103
so I'll know you're there, will ya?

1057
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:59,040
Want to be sure he knows when
he's chickening out on himself.

1058
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:02,244
Want him to get to know
the special thing he is,

1059
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:05,480
or else he won't notice it
when it starts to go.

1060
01:03:05,549 --> 01:03:08,984
Want him to stay awake
and know who the phonies are.

1061
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:12,254
I want him to know how to holler
and put up an argument.

1062
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:16,091
I want a little guts to show
before I can let him go.

1063
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,562
I want to be sure he sees
all the wild possibilities.

1064
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:23,198
I want him to know
it's worth all the trouble

1065
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:26,835
just to give the world a little
goosing once you get the chance.

1066
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:33,608
I want him to know the...
Sneaky, subtle...

1067
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:39,281
Important reason...
He was born a human being...

1068
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:41,216
And not a chair.

1069
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:47,088
Hey, I, brought you
all the way down here.

1070
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,857
I didn't even show you the restaurant.

1071
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:53,361
Hey, "the original lum far's
oriental paradise, rear door."

1072
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:56,031
Shame they closed it.

1073
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,800
Something to do with not being recognized

1074
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:00,368
by the united nations.

1075
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,806
Sandy, I don't want him to go!

1076
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,741
I like having him around here.

1077
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:12,447
What'll I do, Sandy?
Help me out.

1078
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:16,284
You see...

1079
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:19,287
I like when he reads me
from the want ads.

1080
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:25,961
Don't worry, Murray.
We'll do something.

1081
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:28,663
I know the board, the procedures,

1082
01:04:28,732 --> 01:04:30,398
the things we can do.

1083
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:39,808
What I'll do is I'll...
I'll buy a new suit.

1084
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:43,378
First thing is to get a dignified suit.

1085
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:47,315
If you could just get
some kind of job, Murray.

1086
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,050
Get your brother to help you.

1087
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,218
Yeah, right, right.

1088
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:52,487
Is there something you can get
in a hurry?

1089
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:55,523
Yeah, one of those summer suits
with the readymade cuffs.

1090
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:56,858
No, a job.

1091
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:59,461
If you could just bring
some proof of employment

1092
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:00,829
to the hearing, Murray.

1093
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:02,998
Show them how anxious you are to change.

1094
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,966
Show them you want to be reliable!

1095
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:09,871
Yeah!

1096
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,807
Reliable!

1097
01:05:12,876 --> 01:05:16,211
Sandy, we will put on
a great, damn show for them!

1098
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,879
Spectacular reliability!

1099
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:19,281
A reliability parade...

1100
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:21,516
Bands, clothes, banners, everything!

1101
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,791
Great, keep that laugh.
I'll need it later.

1102
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:38,900
Hello, margot?
Murray.

1103
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:44,606
When Arnie comes in, tell him
I need a job in a hurry?

1104
01:05:44,675 --> 01:05:46,875
Tell him to set up
some appointments for lunch

1105
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:49,110
and straight through
the afternoon if he can.

1106
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,680
Tell him, the people
he mentioned this morning

1107
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:53,715
can see me today right away, okay?

1108
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:55,583
Yeah, I'll call him back later.

1109
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:57,986
Hey, thanks, margot.
Bye.

1110
01:05:58,055 --> 01:06:00,188
Hey, Sandy, I'm gonna buy a new suit now.

1111
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:02,891
Can I come with you?
I'd love to watch you buy one.

1112
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:03,960
You better not.

1113
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:05,393
Sandy, I got to move fast.

1114
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,195
You wait for me upstairs,

1115
01:06:07,264 --> 01:06:08,264
okay.

1116
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:12,334
Here's a key for you.

1117
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:14,402
Thank you.

1118
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:15,904
Look, don't go away?

1119
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:17,439
No, I won't.

1120
01:06:19,343 --> 01:06:20,343
Say "good luck."

1121
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:21,476
Good luck.

1122
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:23,678
Say, "you are
a magnificent human being!"

1123
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:25,647
You are a magnificent human being.

1124
01:06:25,716 --> 01:06:26,948
I thought you'd notice.

1125
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:50,939
Mom!

1126
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:54,075
I know you must have been
going out of your mind,

1127
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:55,477
and I'm sorry, mom,

1128
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:58,613
but I'm calling you now
to tell you some wonderful news!

1129
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:15,463
It's a... it's a really
basic relationship.

1130
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:21,569
I'm s-so in love with him,
and... and I'm so very happy!

1131
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:24,406
Well, what do you mean,
what do I mean "happy"?

1132
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:18,026
Well, I mean...
Well, you know... Happy.

1133
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:44,919
I got a great,
new panel-show package.

1134
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:47,055
All ad lib.

1135
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:49,991
You'll be the permanent member
on the panel.

1136
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:51,759
Every afternoon, just talk.

1137
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:54,028
No sweat.

1138
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:57,432
Great running bit for you on the show.

1139
01:08:57,501 --> 01:08:59,200
What's that?

1140
01:08:59,269 --> 01:09:01,269
Honesty.

1141
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:03,271
Absolute honesty.

1142
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,572
The minute you come on,

1143
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,674
the first thing that comes
to your cockamamie head.

1144
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:10,044
Great TV.

1145
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:12,714
You'll be you... a big nut.

1146
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:16,451
Have you decided
on your luncheon order, sir?

1147
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,854
Yes, I'll have a hamburger
and a flashlight.

1148
01:09:24,728 --> 01:09:26,461
Beautiful, beautiful!

1149
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:29,864
You'll be nutsy crazy.

1150
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:32,600
The audience will love you, Murray...

1151
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,369
A big, lovable eccentric.

1152
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:36,704
I'll put you on just the way you are...

1153
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:39,240
A natural phenomenon
like the Grand Canyon.

1154
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:42,076
You'll have that crazy, nutsy face

1155
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,045
and that cockamamie talk.

1156
01:09:44,114 --> 01:09:46,447
Beautiful.

1157
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:50,418
Love... the audience
will love you, Murray.

1158
01:09:50,487 --> 01:09:51,487
Murray?

1159
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:14,976
Mother, now, there's...

1160
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:18,279
Nothing for you to cry about.

1161
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:21,149
Guts. Guts.

1162
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:23,084
See, I told Arnie I wanted to see you

1163
01:10:23,153 --> 01:10:24,619
because there's this new series

1164
01:10:24,688 --> 01:10:26,654
that's going to need a guts attitude...

1165
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,224
Courage kind of thing.

1166
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:32,160
I ought to run
from a writer with your rep,

1167
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:34,362
but, I'm a gambler, burns.

1168
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:36,197
Insecurity excited me.

1169
01:10:38,168 --> 01:10:39,934
Going for a big one this fall.

1170
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:42,870
Series will be really human,
you know, kind of thing?

1171
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,772
Sort of, well, of our time.

1172
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:48,676
Quality concepts,
area of kafka, symbolism,

1173
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:51,980
literate, chekhovian sort of thing.

1174
01:10:52,048 --> 01:10:55,250
We're calling it
"homicide squad."

1175
01:10:55,318 --> 01:10:59,621
Now... I'm just...
Spitballing here.

1176
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:02,423
You know, I got gut reaction,
but, each week,

1177
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:04,892
we ought to be able to get in about...

1178
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:07,428
10 minutes of moral message, you know...

1179
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:10,064
Race-relations thing,
world-peace thing,

1180
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,533
"understanding brings love" thing...

1181
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:13,935
"Love brings understanding."

1182
01:11:14,004 --> 01:11:15,136
Controversy a bit.

1183
01:11:15,205 --> 01:11:17,905
You know, tough, you know, but warm.

1184
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:38,419
You walked out of the restaurant?

1185
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:40,488
Sloan makes you an offer,

1186
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:43,524
and you walk out of the restaurant.

1187
01:12:43,593 --> 01:12:44,659
Murray...

1188
01:12:44,728 --> 01:12:47,962
Arnie, I can't get over this office!

1189
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:50,298
The 22nd floor!

1190
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:52,166
Ho ho!

1191
01:12:52,235 --> 01:12:55,970
You can see everything.

1192
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,873
For god's sake, I don't believe it.

1193
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:00,508
What?

1194
01:13:00,577 --> 01:13:03,211
It's king Kong. He's sitting on
top of the time-life building.

1195
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:04,379
Seems to be crying.

1196
01:13:05,515 --> 01:13:07,615
Ew.
Poor gorilla bastard.

1197
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:10,752
Somebody should've told him they don't
make buildings the way they used to.

1198
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,421
Murray, Sloan didn't make you
such a bad offer.

1199
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:14,689
No, Sloan is an idiot.

1200
01:13:14,758 --> 01:13:16,224
I've got news for you, cookie.

1201
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:18,793
With your situation this week,
you're gonna need idiots.

1202
01:13:18,862 --> 01:13:20,061
Now, you do not have...

1203
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:22,330
You shouldn't holler at me.
I brought you a present.

1204
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:23,831
Murray!

1205
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,640
A-and that other fella
you sent me to,

1206
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:35,109
with the TV series...
A killer, Arnie.

1207
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:39,180
I saw notches on his attaché case.

1208
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:41,983
Murray, you've got a rotten reputation.

1209
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:44,685
Even these guys weren't easy to grab.

1210
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:47,789
Why do you have to build
your own blacklist.

1211
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:49,657
Why can't you get blacklisted
as a communist

1212
01:13:49,726 --> 01:13:50,858
like everybody else?

1213
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,295
What did you do to him?

1214
01:13:55,532 --> 01:13:57,865
You just left him standing there?

1215
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:07,475
You just left him standing there?

1216
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:13,381
Arnie, Arnie, it was beautiful!

1217
01:14:16,252 --> 01:14:19,020
I would've loved to have seen
that. It must have been great.

1218
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:27,962
Wish to god I didn't enjoy you so much.

1219
01:14:28,031 --> 01:14:31,365
I don't do you
any damn good at all, do I?

1220
01:14:31,434 --> 01:14:34,769
All right, come on, Murray,
no more fun and games with Leo.

1221
01:14:34,838 --> 01:14:36,204
Do you understand?

1222
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:39,407
He's absolutely all we have left
before the hearing Thursday.

1223
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:40,741
Don't worry, Arn,

1224
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:43,211
I figure I could always go back
with chuckles the chipmunk.

1225
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:45,213
All right, Murray.

1226
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:49,417
Margot... Get me Leo Herman
on the speakerphone.

1227
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,553
Well, Leo won't be so bad for a while.

1228
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,623
Murray, now, not for a while.

1229
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:58,359
You're gonna have to stick with chuckles.

1230
01:14:58,428 --> 01:15:01,262
Now, my agency lawyer
gave me all the facts.

1231
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:03,264
The most the board will allow you

1232
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:06,100
is a probationary year
with Nick... a trial period.

1233
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:07,602
And the board's investigators

1234
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:10,438
are gonna be checking up on you
every week regularly...

1235
01:15:10,507 --> 01:15:12,840
Checking to see
that you still have your job,

1236
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,842
checking with Leo on your stability,

1237
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:18,246
checking up on the improvements
in your home environment.

1238
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:23,117
Sounds...
Sounds like a parole board.

1239
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:26,120
Yes, it certainly does.

1240
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:29,790
Kidderoonies...

1241
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:34,362
You take it from your old buddy,
the old chippermunk chuckles.

1242
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:37,431
If your get-up-and-go
has got up and left,

1243
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,968
just one 10-cent bag
of these crispy chuckle chips

1244
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:43,738
will give you
that barrel-of-monkeys,

1245
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:47,508
boat-has-never-sunky
feeling again.

1246
01:15:47,577 --> 01:15:49,644
Yay. Yay.
Yay. Yay.

1247
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:51,546
George.

1248
01:15:51,614 --> 01:15:54,048
Is that a "yay"?
What kind of a "yay" is that?

1249
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:57,118
I ask for a "yay,"
you give me a death rattle.

1250
01:15:57,186 --> 01:15:58,486
Come on, look,

1251
01:15:58,555 --> 01:16:01,822
if you're gonna rehearse
a "yay," rehearse a yay.

1252
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,524
Yay! Yay!
Yay! Yay!

1253
01:16:03,593 --> 01:16:04,792
Death.

1254
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:06,327
We're dying.

1255
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:09,063
With that kind of a "yay,"
the show is dying.

1256
01:16:09,132 --> 01:16:10,565
That's why the show is dying.

1257
01:16:10,633 --> 01:16:12,600
The kids don't have a "yay" attitude.

1258
01:16:12,669 --> 01:16:14,335
Dead dying dead.

1259
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:16,270
Death... doornail-dying dead.

1260
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:18,306
Call for you,
Mr. Herman.

1261
01:16:18,374 --> 01:16:19,374
What is that?

1262
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:20,575
It's a telephone.

1263
01:16:20,643 --> 01:16:22,677
Arnold burns' office calling.

1264
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,378
Great, wonderful, wonderful.

1265
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,379
Hello, Arnie?

1266
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:26,714
Here I am!
There he is!

1267
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:28,916
You got my voice
coming out of that speakerphone

1268
01:16:28,985 --> 01:16:30,151
in your office, right?

1269
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:32,553
Am I coming through?
Am I coming through there?

1270
01:16:32,622 --> 01:16:34,555
Clearly, Leo.
Murray's here.

1271
01:16:34,624 --> 01:16:38,159
Murray, Murray, the wonderful wild man!

1272
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:41,462
Hey, kidderoonies, looks like
your old uncle Murray's

1273
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:45,099
coming back to write some of
those wonderful scripteroonies

1274
01:16:45,168 --> 01:16:47,902
for us again!

1275
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:50,972
Yay!! Yay!!
Yay!! Yay!!

1276
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,540
Murray, what did you do?

1277
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:53,975
The job.

1278
01:16:54,043 --> 01:16:55,242
The hearing.
What...

1279
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:45,760
Well, say, did you do all this?

1280
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,062
Yes, Nick.
Do you like it?

1281
01:17:48,131 --> 01:17:49,997
I think it's superb.

1282
01:17:50,066 --> 01:17:53,367
I mean, imagine my surprise
when I saw it.

1283
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:57,004
Murray went downtown
to see your uncle Arnold.

1284
01:17:57,073 --> 01:17:58,939
He's going to get a job!

1285
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:01,809
No kidding?!
Hey, that's terrific!

1286
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:04,278
That's just terrific!

1287
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:07,982
See, lady...
He was developing into a bum.

1288
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:10,818
I mean, you don't want to see
someone you like

1289
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:13,621
developing into a bum
and doing nutty things.

1290
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:15,389
You know what he does?

1291
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:17,191
He hollers.

1292
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,860
Like, we were on park Avenue last Sunday,

1293
01:18:19,929 --> 01:18:22,196
and it's very early in the morning.

1294
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:24,498
There's no one in the street, see,

1295
01:18:24,567 --> 01:18:27,268
just all these big,
quiet apartment houses.

1296
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:30,271
And he hollers, "rich people!"

1297
01:18:30,339 --> 01:18:35,443
"I want to see you all out
on the street for volleyball,

1298
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:37,111
and snap it up!"

1299
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,846
And you know, sometimes,

1300
01:18:38,915 --> 01:18:41,816
if we're in a crowded elevator someplace,

1301
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:44,218
he'll turn to me and he'll say,

1302
01:18:44,287 --> 01:18:47,555
"Max... There will be
no more of this self-pity.

1303
01:18:47,623 --> 01:18:49,457
"Now, you're 40.

1304
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:52,293
It's time you got
used to being a midget."

1305
01:18:53,763 --> 01:18:55,563
And everybody stares.

1306
01:18:55,631 --> 01:18:57,665
He has a wonderful time.

1307
01:18:57,734 --> 01:19:01,302
What are you gonna do with
someone who hollers like that?

1308
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:04,472
You know, last week,
in Macy's, he did that.

1309
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:08,542
Well, if you want to know
the truth, lady,

1310
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:09,777
that was pretty funny.

1311
01:19:19,622 --> 01:19:22,523
I think you're a very nice lady.

1312
01:19:22,592 --> 01:19:24,558
What do you think of me?

1313
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:27,828
I think you're very nice, also.

1314
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:29,697
You know, a very nice quality you have

1315
01:19:29,766 --> 01:19:31,298
is that you're a good listener,

1316
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:33,768
which is important to me
because of how much I talk.

1317
01:19:35,171 --> 01:19:37,338
Hey, you are a laugher, aren't you, lady?

1318
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:38,339
I guess so, Nick.

1319
01:19:38,407 --> 01:19:39,407
Yeah.

1320
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:45,012
Would you like some fruit?

1321
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:46,847
We got lots of fruit.

1322
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:49,884
No, thank you, Nick.

1323
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:53,154
If you'd like to call
your mother or someone,

1324
01:19:53,222 --> 01:19:56,023
please feel free to use the telephone.

1325
01:19:56,092 --> 01:20:00,928
Or my desk if you want to read
a book or something.

1326
01:20:00,997 --> 01:20:02,229
Or any... any of the chairs.

1327
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:05,266
I will.
Thank you, Nick.

1328
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:06,400
Okay.

1329
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:16,811
Well... You gonna be staying
around here for a while?

1330
01:20:16,879 --> 01:20:19,914
I might. Yes.
Yes.

1331
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:34,929
Well...

1332
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:36,564
Good luck to you, lady.

1333
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:38,232
Murray!

1334
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:40,801
What a nice suit you bought!

1335
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:41,902
Hi.

1336
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:43,470
Yeah.

1337
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:44,539
How is everything?

1338
01:20:44,607 --> 01:20:46,140
Which job did you get?

1339
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:48,642
Still going good, Violet?

1340
01:20:48,711 --> 01:20:50,477
Marvelous!

1341
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:51,946
She's in her third month.

1342
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,113
She's pregnant?

1343
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:55,115
No, unemployment insurance.

1344
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:58,552
Don't keep me in suspense.
Which job did you get?

1345
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:01,188
I shall now leave you breathless

1346
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:03,958
with the strange and wondrous tale

1347
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:07,962
of this sturdy lad's adventures
today in downtown oz.

1348
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,464
Now, picture, if you will, me.

1349
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:14,034
I am walking on east 51st street
about an hour ago,

1350
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:16,604
practicing how to say "I am sorry"

1351
01:21:16,672 --> 01:21:18,105
with a little style.

1352
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:19,240
Sorry for what?

1353
01:21:19,308 --> 01:21:20,341
Well, for anything.

1354
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:21,809
Just rehearsing.

1355
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:23,611
Well you know how it is

1356
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,046
when you're walking down the
street, talking to yourself...

1357
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:27,948
How suddenly you say something out loud?

1358
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:29,316
So, I said, "I'm sorry."

1359
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:32,152
And this fella coming by...
A complete stranger...

1360
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,154
He looks up a second and he says,

1361
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:37,291
"that's all right, Mac,"
and he goes right on.

1362
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,826
He automatically forgave me.

1363
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:39,994
I communicated.

1364
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,329
Now, 5:00 rush hour in midtown,
you could say,

1365
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,531
"sir, I believe your hair is on fire,"

1366
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,433
and they wouldn't even hear you.

1367
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:49,570
So I decided to test the whole
thing out scientifically.

1368
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:52,306
I just stood there
on the corner of 51st and Lex

1369
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:55,276
saying "I'm sorry"
to everybody that came by.

1370
01:21:55,344 --> 01:21:57,378
"I'm so sorry, sir."

1371
01:21:57,446 --> 01:21:59,346
"I'm terribly sorry, madam."

1372
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,682
"Say, there, miss,
I'm sorry."

1373
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:04,952
Of course, I got a few funny looks,

1374
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:08,789
but I swear, Sandy,
75% of them forgave me.

1375
01:22:08,858 --> 01:22:10,724
Something had happened to all of them

1376
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:13,060
for which they felt somebody
should apologize.

1377
01:22:13,129 --> 01:22:14,328
It was fabulous.

1378
01:22:14,397 --> 01:22:17,031
I had tapped some vast reservoir.

1379
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,899
I just said "I'm sorry,"

1380
01:22:18,968 --> 01:22:22,002
and they were all so generous, so kind.

1381
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:23,203
Murray?

1382
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:26,106
Yeah, Sandy, I could run up
on the roof right now

1383
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:27,508
and holler "I'm sorry,"

1384
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:30,244
and a half a million people
would holler back,

1385
01:22:30,313 --> 01:22:33,247
"that's okay, just see
that you don't do it again!"

1386
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:37,017
Murray, you didn't take any of the jobs.

1387
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:42,122
Sandy, i...

1388
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:45,759
I'm sorry.

1389
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:47,861
I'm very sorry.

1390
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,735
Well, damn it, lady,
that was a beautiful apology.

1391
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:58,205
I mean, you got to love a guy
who can apologize so nice.

1392
01:22:58,274 --> 01:23:01,709
I rehearsed it for over an hour.

1393
01:23:01,777 --> 01:23:04,511
Sandy...

1394
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:08,015
That's the most
you should expect from life...

1395
01:23:08,084 --> 01:23:12,152
A really good apology for
all the things you won't get.

1396
01:23:14,357 --> 01:23:16,690
Murray, I don't understand.

1397
01:23:16,759 --> 01:23:19,626
What happens to Nick?
What about the welfare board?

1398
01:23:19,695 --> 01:23:20,861
Sandra, I...

1399
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:23,130
Murray, if you didn't like
the job... jobs

1400
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,833
your brother found for you,
then take any job.

1401
01:23:25,901 --> 01:23:27,801
Sandy, it isn't the job.

1402
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:32,573
I have had no effect on you at all.

1403
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:34,975
I've made no difference.

1404
01:23:35,044 --> 01:23:38,879
Sandy, you are a cute, jolly lady.

1405
01:23:38,948 --> 01:23:42,316
Sandy, hey...

1406
01:23:42,385 --> 01:23:45,886
There's a great sailing tomorrow...

1407
01:23:45,955 --> 01:23:49,757
The embarkation of the season.

1408
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:53,894
53rd street dock at 1:00...

1409
01:23:53,963 --> 01:23:58,832
The<i> Montana maru,</i> Pearl of the Atlantic,

1410
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:03,804
bound for Europe, khorramshahr, sumatra,

1411
01:24:03,873 --> 01:24:07,608
and Beirut, and points east.

1412
01:24:07,676 --> 01:24:10,811
We'll stand on the dock and watch it go.

1413
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,580
Gives you the genuine feeling

1414
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:15,449
of the beginning of things.

1415
01:24:15,518 --> 01:24:19,920
Hey, bon voyage, Charlie!
Have a wonderful time!

1416
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:27,828
I can see why Nick liked it here.

1417
01:24:27,897 --> 01:24:31,198
I would like it, too,
if I was 12 years old.

1418
01:24:35,271 --> 01:24:38,705
Hey, stick with me,
Dr. markowitz.

1419
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:40,441
You know, anything can happen above

1420
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:41,875
an abandoned Chinese restaurant.

1421
01:24:47,216 --> 01:24:50,918
There are so many
really attractive things

1422
01:24:50,986 --> 01:24:54,321
that you can do
with a one-room apartment

1423
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:57,891
if you're willing
to use your imagination.

1424
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:00,928
Goodbye, Murray.

1425
01:25:13,576 --> 01:25:16,210
You forgot your files!

1426
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,011
Hey! Damn it!

1427
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,813
You forgot your files.

1428
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:28,789
I've been attacked
by the<i> ladies' home journal.</i>

1429
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:36,530
Place has an unusual quality
now... a kind of fun gothic.

1430
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:45,506
Where is my eagle?!

1431
01:25:45,574 --> 01:25:50,110
Well, what have we got here...
Sunnybrook farm?!

1432
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:31,618
Everybody, onstage
for a Hawaiian number, please!

1433
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:05,953
Now I'm insulted.

1434
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:08,355
You walked out of my office.

1435
01:27:08,424 --> 01:27:13,126
That wasn't a nice thing
to do to me, Murray.

1436
01:27:13,195 --> 01:27:16,597
You come to my office today
like George god.

1437
01:27:16,665 --> 01:27:18,198
Everybody's supposed to come up

1438
01:27:18,267 --> 01:27:20,601
and audition for human being
in front of you.

1439
01:27:20,669 --> 01:27:22,669
I called Leo back.
I apologized.

1440
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:24,771
I told him the phone broke down.

1441
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,374
I... everything
is going to be fine.

1442
01:27:27,443 --> 01:27:29,676
Arnie, you said I insulted you.

1443
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:32,813
Well, damn it, get angry.

1444
01:27:32,881 --> 01:27:36,450
Come on. Raise your voice...
At least, your eyebrows.

1445
01:27:36,518 --> 01:27:39,987
Please, please have an argument with me.

1446
01:27:40,055 --> 01:27:41,188
Murray, you're just...

1447
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:43,023
You're just getting excited, that's all.

1448
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:44,858
Now, look, I've got Leo to come over.

1449
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:46,126
He's gonna see you tonight.

1450
01:27:46,195 --> 01:27:48,328
Everything is gonna
turn out fine. You'll see.

1451
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:50,964
Arnie, will you forget that?
Will you forget it?

1452
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:52,033
Look at...

1453
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:53,267
If you love Nick

1454
01:27:53,335 --> 01:27:56,103
or whoever it is
he's calling himself this week,

1455
01:27:56,171 --> 01:27:59,640
you have got to take any kind
of a stupid job to keep him.

1456
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:03,143
Now, I even thought maybe
Shirley and me would take him,

1457
01:28:03,212 --> 01:28:06,380
but, you know, with our
three kids, she'd go crazy.

1458
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:07,881
Don't worry, Arnie.

1459
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:11,285
This, welfare crowd,
they know what they're doing.

1460
01:28:11,353 --> 01:28:13,820
They'll put Nick with a good family.

1461
01:28:13,889 --> 01:28:15,889
Yep.

1462
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:18,058
Murray, I finally
figured out your problem...

1463
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:22,462
There is only one thing
that really bothers you...

1464
01:28:22,531 --> 01:28:23,997
Other people.

1465
01:28:24,066 --> 01:28:25,565
The enemy.

1466
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,601
Watch out, Murray.

1467
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:29,169
They're everywhere.

1468
01:28:29,238 --> 01:28:30,937
Go ahead, Arnold.
Give me advice.

1469
01:28:31,006 --> 01:28:32,906
At $30,000 a year, you can afford it.

1470
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:34,107
I get it.

1471
01:28:34,176 --> 01:28:36,510
If I'm so smart, why ain't I poor?

1472
01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:38,879
Well, you better get a damn good
act of your own, buddy,

1473
01:28:38,947 --> 01:28:40,781
before you start
giving mine the raspberry.

1474
01:28:40,849 --> 01:28:42,983
What's this game you play
gonna be like in 10 years

1475
01:28:43,052 --> 01:28:44,117
without youth?

1476
01:28:44,186 --> 01:28:45,352
Murray, I can't watch this.

1477
01:28:46,355 --> 01:28:47,621
You've got to shape up.

1478
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:49,022
Shape up?!

1479
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:50,257
That's right... shape up.

1480
01:28:50,326 --> 01:28:53,760
Arnie, what the hell happened to you?

1481
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:57,297
You got so old I don't know you anymore.

1482
01:28:57,366 --> 01:28:59,499
Who is it?

1483
01:28:59,568 --> 01:29:04,237
When you quit Harry the fur king
on 28th street, remember?

1484
01:29:04,306 --> 01:29:05,839
That's 20 years ago, Murray.

1485
01:29:07,176 --> 01:29:09,443
Harry said you weren't
behaving maturely enough

1486
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:10,744
for a salesman.

1487
01:29:10,813 --> 01:29:14,114
Your, clothes didn't match or something.

1488
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:17,417
So the next day, you dressed perfectly...

1489
01:29:17,486 --> 01:29:19,286
Homburg gray suit, cufflinks,

1490
01:29:19,355 --> 01:29:21,822
carrying a briefcase
and a rolled umbrella,

1491
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:26,827
and you came into Harry's office
on roller skates.

1492
01:29:26,895 --> 01:29:28,095
Where'd they go, Arnie?

1493
01:29:28,163 --> 01:29:30,130
What happened to your roller skates?

1494
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:33,100
I don't do practical jokes,
anymore, if that's what you mean.

1495
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:34,234
Practical.

1496
01:29:34,303 --> 01:29:38,672
That's right...
A way to stay alive.

1497
01:29:38,741 --> 01:29:41,641
Hey, if most things aren't funny, Arn,

1498
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:44,711
then they're only exactly what they are.

1499
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:47,214
Then it's just
one long dental appointment,

1500
01:29:47,282 --> 01:29:49,850
interrupted occasionally
by something exciting

1501
01:29:49,918 --> 01:29:51,752
like waiting or falling asleep.

1502
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:54,921
What's the point if I leave
things just the way I find them?

1503
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:56,923
Then I'm just adding to the noise,

1504
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,726
I'm just taking up
some more room on the subway.

1505
01:29:59,795 --> 01:30:02,696
Murray, the welfare board
has these specifications.

1506
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:05,332
All you have to do
is to make up your mind...

1507
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:08,001
God. Arnie,
you don't understand anymore.

1508
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:11,304
You've got that wide stare
that people stick in their eyes

1509
01:30:11,373 --> 01:30:13,707
so nobody will know their head's asleep.

1510
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:17,978
You have to be a moaner, a shuffler.

1511
01:30:18,046 --> 01:30:20,814
You want me to come, sit,
and eat fruit with you

1512
01:30:20,883 --> 01:30:22,449
and watch the clock run out.

1513
01:30:22,518 --> 01:30:25,318
You start to drag and stumble
under the rotten weight

1514
01:30:25,387 --> 01:30:27,921
of all the people
who should have been told off.

1515
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:31,258
All the things you should have said,

1516
01:30:31,326 --> 01:30:34,961
all the specifications that aren't yours.

1517
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:37,097
You know, the only thing
you've got left to reject

1518
01:30:37,166 --> 01:30:38,498
is your food in a restaurant.

1519
01:30:38,567 --> 01:30:40,300
If they do it wrong, you can send it back

1520
01:30:40,369 --> 01:30:42,002
and make a big fuss with the waiter.

1521
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:48,708
Five months ago, I was
on a subway on my way to work.

1522
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:52,412
I was sitting on the express,
the same as every morning,

1523
01:30:52,481 --> 01:30:54,014
looking out the window,

1524
01:30:54,082 --> 01:30:56,950
watching the local stops go by
in the dark

1525
01:30:57,019 --> 01:30:59,619
with an empty head and my arms folded,

1526
01:30:59,688 --> 01:31:02,856
not feeling great, not feeling rotten...

1527
01:31:04,927 --> 01:31:07,127
just...

1528
01:31:07,196 --> 01:31:09,563
Not feeling.

1529
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:13,733
And for a minute,
I-i couldn't remember.

1530
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:18,238
I didn't know,
unless I really concentrated,

1531
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:23,276
whether it was a Tuesday
or a Thursday or a...

1532
01:31:25,914 --> 01:31:30,717
For a minute,
it could have been any day, Arn.

1533
01:31:30,786 --> 01:31:33,153
I got to know what day it is.

1534
01:31:33,222 --> 01:31:36,323
I got to know what's the name of the game

1535
01:31:36,391 --> 01:31:40,360
and what the rules are
without anyone else telling me.

1536
01:31:40,429 --> 01:31:43,864
You got to own your own days
and name them...

1537
01:31:43,932 --> 01:31:46,900
Each one of them...
Every one of them.

1538
01:31:46,969 --> 01:31:49,236
Or else the years go right by,

1539
01:31:49,304 --> 01:31:51,705
and none of them belong to you.

1540
01:31:53,141 --> 01:31:57,878
And that ain't just for weekends, kiddo.

1541
01:31:59,615 --> 01:32:01,815
Well

1542
01:32:01,884 --> 01:32:04,451
here it is the day after
Irving r. Feldman's birthday,

1543
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:05,920
and I never even congratulated him.

1544
01:32:05,954 --> 01:32:07,721
Murray!

1545
01:32:12,895 --> 01:32:14,194
Well, what's so funny?

1546
01:32:14,263 --> 01:32:15,896
I scared myself.

1547
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:23,403
Murray, I've long been aware...

1548
01:32:25,374 --> 01:32:28,275
I've long been aware that
you don't respect me so much.

1549
01:32:28,343 --> 01:32:31,878
No. I suppose there are a lot of
brothers who don't get along,

1550
01:32:31,947 --> 01:32:38,385
but... In reference to us
and considering the factors...

1551
01:32:38,453 --> 01:32:40,186
Sounds like a contract, doesn't it?

1552
01:32:42,391 --> 01:32:46,359
Unfortunately, for you, Murray,
you want to be a hero.

1553
01:32:46,428 --> 01:32:48,094
If maybe a fellow falls into the lake

1554
01:32:48,163 --> 01:32:49,529
you can jump in and save him.

1555
01:32:49,598 --> 01:32:51,131
There's still that kind of stuff.

1556
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:55,001
So, who gets opportunities
like that in midtown Manhattan

1557
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,636
with all that traffic?

1558
01:32:58,807 --> 01:33:01,107
I'm willing to deal
with the available world.

1559
01:33:01,176 --> 01:33:03,610
I don't choose to shake it up,
but to live with it.

1560
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,879
There's the people who spill things,

1561
01:33:05,948 --> 01:33:08,481
and there's the people
who get spilled on,

1562
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:10,951
and I don't choose to notice the stains.

1563
01:33:11,019 --> 01:33:13,186
I have a wife, and I have children,

1564
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:15,722
and business, like they say, is business.

1565
01:33:15,791 --> 01:33:18,325
I'm not an exceptional man,

1566
01:33:18,393 --> 01:33:22,295
so it's possible for me to stay
with things the way they are.

1567
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:23,797
I'm lucky.

1568
01:33:23,865 --> 01:33:26,700
I'm gifted.

1569
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:31,538
I have talent for surrender,
and I'm at peace, but you...

1570
01:33:31,607 --> 01:33:37,544
You're cursed, and I like you, Murray.

1571
01:33:37,613 --> 01:33:39,045
So it makes me sad.

1572
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:43,183
You don't have the gift,
and I can see the torture of it.

1573
01:33:43,251 --> 01:33:47,153
All I can do is worry for you,
but I will not worry for myself.

1574
01:33:47,222 --> 01:33:50,490
You can't convince me
that I'm one of the bad guys.

1575
01:33:50,559 --> 01:33:53,493
I get up.
I go.

1576
01:33:53,562 --> 01:33:56,630
I lie a little.
I peddle a little.

1577
01:33:56,698 --> 01:33:59,833
I watch the rules.
I talk the talk.

1578
01:33:59,901 --> 01:34:02,736
We fellows have those offices
high up there

1579
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:06,673
so that we can catch the wind
and go with it however it blows,

1580
01:34:06,742 --> 01:34:10,644
but... and I'm not gonna
apologize for it...

1581
01:34:10,712 --> 01:34:13,380
I take pride.

1582
01:34:13,448 --> 01:34:17,784
I am the best possible Arnold burns.

1583
01:34:24,626 --> 01:34:26,926
Give my regards
to Irving r. Feldman, will you?

1584
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:28,261
Hey, Arnie.

1585
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:31,064
Murray, please, allow me once
to leave a room before you do.

1586
01:34:44,746 --> 01:34:46,212
Hey, Murray, watch it.

1587
01:34:47,783 --> 01:34:49,282
Yeah, it's okay now.

1588
01:34:56,425 --> 01:34:58,525
Hey.
That's great Murray.

1589
01:34:58,593 --> 01:34:59,826
Hiya, Nick.

1590
01:34:59,895 --> 01:35:02,128
You don't give it enough play,
it goes into a dive.

1591
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:03,430
Let's go downstairs.

1592
01:35:03,498 --> 01:35:05,265
Murray...
I want to talk to you.

1593
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:07,901
This afternoon in school,
I made a decision.

1594
01:35:07,969 --> 01:35:10,603
Right in the middle
of creative geography class,

1595
01:35:10,672 --> 01:35:13,406
I decided that since
you were getting a job today,

1596
01:35:13,475 --> 01:35:16,109
then I made up my mind
it was time for me, also,

1597
01:35:16,178 --> 01:35:19,512
to finish a certain matter
which I've been putting off.

1598
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:21,314
See, for the past couple of months,

1599
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:23,216
I've been considering different names,

1600
01:35:23,285 --> 01:35:25,018
'cause in 4 weeks I am gonna be 13,

1601
01:35:25,087 --> 01:35:27,187
and I've got to pick
my permanent first name

1602
01:35:27,255 --> 01:35:29,122
like we said.

1603
01:35:29,191 --> 01:35:31,324
You should just go on
calling yourself Nick.

1604
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:33,293
You've been using that one the longest.

1605
01:35:33,361 --> 01:35:36,362
Well, Nick is a name for a short person.

1606
01:35:36,431 --> 01:35:37,664
Since I'm a short person,

1607
01:35:37,733 --> 01:35:40,300
I don't believe I should put
a lot of attention on it.

1608
01:35:40,368 --> 01:35:44,137
What do you mean? Where'd
you get the idea you were short?

1609
01:35:44,206 --> 01:35:47,207
From people who are taller than I am.

1610
01:35:47,275 --> 01:35:48,808
That is ridiculous.

1611
01:35:48,877 --> 01:35:50,477
Sure.

1612
01:35:50,545 --> 01:35:53,713
Up there, it's ridiculous.

1613
01:35:53,782 --> 01:35:57,217
But from down here where I am,
it's not so ridiculous.

1614
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:07,127
You know, half the girls in
my class are taller than me...

1615
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:11,131
especially Susan bookwalter.

1616
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:17,570
Nick, you happen to be a nice
medium height for your age.

1617
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:20,507
So, how is it everybody
crouches over when I'm around?

1618
01:36:20,575 --> 01:36:21,975
Because you're a kid.

1619
01:36:22,043 --> 01:36:24,844
Look, you come from a fairly tall family.

1620
01:36:24,913 --> 01:36:28,248
Next couple of years,
you're gonna grow like crazy.

1621
01:36:28,316 --> 01:36:30,450
Really, every day you're getting bigger.

1622
01:36:30,519 --> 01:36:32,886
But so is Susan bookwalter.

1623
01:36:36,491 --> 01:36:38,091
So, for a couple of months,

1624
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:40,727
I've been considering various tall names.

1625
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:42,829
Then I thought about
just picking any name,

1626
01:36:42,898 --> 01:36:45,665
putting "captain" in front of it
so it'd Jack it up a little,

1627
01:36:45,734 --> 01:36:47,934
but I really didn't like that either.

1628
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,338
But then...

1629
01:36:52,407 --> 01:36:56,910
Last week, I finally and really decided,

1630
01:36:56,978 --> 01:37:01,414
and I took out a new library
card to see how it looks.

1631
01:37:01,483 --> 01:37:06,152
And today I figured I'd make it
definite and official.

1632
01:37:09,691 --> 01:37:12,058
That's<i> my</i> library card.

1633
01:37:12,127 --> 01:37:14,861
Well, no. That's
the whole thing. It's mine.

1634
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:17,430
Well, this one says Murray burns on it.

1635
01:37:17,499 --> 01:37:19,265
Well, yeah.
That's the name that I picked.

1636
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:20,366
So I took out a new card

1637
01:37:20,435 --> 01:37:22,202
to see how it looks and make it official.

1638
01:37:26,775 --> 01:37:29,676
Hey, Murray, baby, don't jump!

1639
01:37:29,744 --> 01:37:32,745
Hey, fella, don't jump!
I'll meet you inside!

1640
01:37:34,082 --> 01:37:35,082
Hey, it's Mr. Herman.

1641
01:37:35,116 --> 01:37:36,482
That's the job you took?

1642
01:37:38,587 --> 01:37:41,921
Mu-u-u-r-r-r!

1643
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:45,558
Hey, mu-u-u-r-r-r!

1644
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:50,296
There he is.

1645
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:53,466
There's the old monkey.
There's the old joker.

1646
01:37:53,535 --> 01:37:55,034
Yeah, here he is, Leo.

1647
01:37:55,103 --> 01:37:57,637
There he is.
There's the little guy.

1648
01:37:57,706 --> 01:38:02,008
Look-a here, little guy,
I got a chuckles statue for you.

1649
01:38:02,077 --> 01:38:06,012
Well, thank you,
Mr. Herman.

1650
01:38:06,081 --> 01:38:09,515
Imagine how pleased I am to receive it.

1651
01:38:09,584 --> 01:38:14,087
It's a very artistic statue,
and very good cardboard, too.

1652
01:38:14,155 --> 01:38:15,922
And I got a chuckles hat for you

1653
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:17,790
just like the old chipmunk wears.

1654
01:38:17,859 --> 01:38:19,525
Thank you.
Whoop!

1655
01:38:19,594 --> 01:38:21,861
Thank you.

1656
01:38:23,565 --> 01:38:24,931
You're wearing the chuckles hat.

1657
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,432
You got to say the chuckles hello.

1658
01:38:26,501 --> 01:38:28,101
The what?

1659
01:38:28,169 --> 01:38:31,671
Chip-chip chippermunky!

1660
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:33,573
Yeah! Sure.

1661
01:38:33,642 --> 01:38:36,042
Chip-chip chippermunky!

1662
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,480
May I know your first name?

1663
01:38:40,548 --> 01:38:42,382
It's Nick most of the time.

1664
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:43,516
Most of the time.

1665
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:45,285
Look what I got here...

1666
01:38:45,353 --> 01:38:48,821
Two big bags of
chuckle chip potato chips?

1667
01:38:50,025 --> 01:38:51,858
Nicky, you want to put these crispy chips

1668
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:53,359
in a bowl or something for us?

1669
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:54,827
Yeah, and take your time, Nick,

1670
01:38:54,896 --> 01:38:56,496
'cause your uncle and me got some...

1671
01:38:56,564 --> 01:38:59,232
We got some grown-up talking
to do.

1672
01:38:59,301 --> 01:39:00,900
OK... the kid hates me.

1673
01:39:00,969 --> 01:39:02,969
I didn't go over very well with him.

1674
01:39:03,038 --> 01:39:04,437
I pushed a little too hard.

1675
01:39:04,506 --> 01:39:05,805
Nice kid, Murray.

1676
01:39:05,874 --> 01:39:07,373
Yeah.
How are your kids, Leo?

1677
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:09,008
Fine, fine, but I swear to god,

1678
01:39:09,077 --> 01:39:11,744
even they don't like my show
since you stopped writing it.

1679
01:39:11,813 --> 01:39:13,546
My youngest one,
my 6-year-old...

1680
01:39:15,417 --> 01:39:17,083
Ralphie.
Ralphie...

1681
01:39:17,152 --> 01:39:21,120
Watches "the funny bunny show"
every morning now instead of me.

1682
01:39:21,189 --> 01:39:24,624
I have been bombing out
on the show every morning.

1683
01:39:24,693 --> 01:39:27,193
You know what it feels like to
bomb out in front of children.

1684
01:39:27,262 --> 01:39:29,495
You flop out in front of kids,
Murray, I swear to god,

1685
01:39:29,564 --> 01:39:31,731
they're ready to kill you,
or else they stare at you.

1686
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,967
That's the worst...
That hurt, innocent little stare

1687
01:39:34,035 --> 01:39:35,401
like you just killed their pup

1688
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:36,936
or ate their turtle or something.

1689
01:39:37,005 --> 01:39:38,938
Murray, have you back with me
at the studios.

1690
01:39:39,007 --> 01:39:41,207
See you at the show tomorrow.
It's gonna be beautiful.

1691
01:39:41,276 --> 01:39:42,276
You're the best.

1692
01:39:42,344 --> 01:39:43,754
I-I appreciate you feeling
that way, Leo.

1693
01:39:43,778 --> 01:39:44,898
This afternoon, the phone...

1694
01:39:44,946 --> 01:39:46,346
You walked out on me, didn't you?

1695
01:39:46,414 --> 01:39:47,580
Yeah, Leo.

1696
01:39:47,649 --> 01:39:49,182
Why?
Why do you do this to me?

1697
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:51,117
I'm sorry.
No, I was only kidding now.

1698
01:39:51,186 --> 01:39:53,386
Don't tell me...
I know I make people nervous.

1699
01:39:53,455 --> 01:39:55,521
Who can listen to me
for 10 minutes, right?

1700
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:56,990
You see that?
You see that?

1701
01:39:57,058 --> 01:39:59,425
See how I kept touching my suit,
my tie like that?

1702
01:39:59,494 --> 01:40:02,228
I keep touching myself
to make sure I'm still here.

1703
01:40:02,297 --> 01:40:05,531
I get this feeling... maybe I
vanished when I wasn't looking.

1704
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:08,234
No, I'm sure that you're here, Leo.

1705
01:40:08,303 --> 01:40:10,903
See how he talks to me a little nasty?

1706
01:40:10,972 --> 01:40:12,138
I like it.

1707
01:40:12,207 --> 01:40:14,273
It's straight. It's real.
I like it.

1708
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:17,143
You know what I got around me
on the show?

1709
01:40:17,212 --> 01:40:19,679
Finks, dwarfs, phonies, and frauds.

1710
01:40:19,748 --> 01:40:22,015
No Murrays...
The show is boring.

1711
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:24,684
Boring, boring, boring, boredom, bore.

1712
01:40:24,753 --> 01:40:27,387
Boring, boring, boring, boring.

1713
01:40:27,455 --> 01:40:29,555
Boring, boredom, bore!
Murray.

1714
01:40:29,624 --> 01:40:33,092
Boring, boredom, bore.
Boring, boring, boring.

1715
01:40:35,497 --> 01:40:39,732
I believe that I left my files here.

1716
01:40:39,801 --> 01:40:43,536
I came to get my files.

1717
01:40:43,605 --> 01:40:45,705
May I have my files, please?

1718
01:40:45,774 --> 01:40:47,473
Excuse me.

1719
01:40:49,144 --> 01:40:52,678
Chuckles the chipmunk,
this is minnie mouse.

1720
01:40:52,747 --> 01:40:54,013
Hiya, minnie.

1721
01:40:54,082 --> 01:40:56,249
You must be Mr. Herman.

1722
01:40:57,819 --> 01:40:59,152
I must be.
I must be him.

1723
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:01,521
Well, I'll be on my way.

1724
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,738
That's a very attractive girl,
that minnie. What does she do?

1725
01:41:07,762 --> 01:41:09,395
She's my decorator.

1726
01:41:18,473 --> 01:41:21,541
Sh...
She's done a wonderful job.

1727
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:24,644
The place is great, Murray.
It's loose! It's open!

1728
01:41:24,712 --> 01:41:26,212
It's free!
I love it.

1729
01:41:26,281 --> 01:41:28,781
A wonderful crazy place.

1730
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:35,021
My god, you must make out like
mad in a place like this?

1731
01:41:37,459 --> 01:41:39,092
How is it I never came here before?

1732
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:40,693
You were here last January, Leo.

1733
01:41:40,762 --> 01:41:42,695
Murray, you worked with me
for three years.

1734
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:43,930
I never saw your apartment.

1735
01:41:43,998 --> 01:41:45,531
You were here last January, Leo.

1736
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,933
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1737
01:41:47,001 --> 01:41:50,169
Wasn't I here recently, in the winter?

1738
01:41:50,238 --> 01:41:52,138
Last January, I think.

1739
01:41:52,207 --> 01:41:54,540
I remember I came here
to get you back on the show,

1740
01:41:54,609 --> 01:41:56,075
and you wouldn't listen to me.

1741
01:41:56,144 --> 01:41:57,677
It was the week after you quit,

1742
01:41:57,745 --> 01:41:59,278
but you walked into the kitchen

1743
01:41:59,347 --> 01:42:01,514
and started singing
"yes, sir, that's my baby,"

1744
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:03,883
and I left, feeling very foolish

1745
01:42:03,952 --> 01:42:06,652
like I had footprints on my face, you...

1746
01:42:06,721 --> 01:42:08,488
You monkey.

1747
01:42:08,556 --> 01:42:11,691
You're a monkey. You're
an old monkey, aren't you?

1748
01:42:11,759 --> 01:42:12,992
Walked in the kitchen

1749
01:42:13,061 --> 01:42:15,761
and started singing
"yes, sir, that's my baby."

1750
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:18,231
You know what I got from that experience?

1751
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:21,934
A rash.
I broke out something terrible.

1752
01:42:22,003 --> 01:42:23,102
Heh.

1753
01:42:23,171 --> 01:42:26,372
Minnie mouse.

1754
01:42:26,441 --> 01:42:28,407
Minnie mouse!

1755
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:32,245
You told me her name was minnie mouse!

1756
01:42:35,216 --> 01:42:36,549
I swear to god,

1757
01:42:36,618 --> 01:42:38,985
I think my mission in life
is to feed you straight lines.

1758
01:42:39,053 --> 01:42:40,820
Like out of a fallout shelter...

1759
01:42:40,889 --> 01:42:42,722
That's what you got here, murr...

1760
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:45,258
Protection against the idiots
in the atmosphere.

1761
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:47,560
It's free.
It's free, free, free.

1762
01:42:47,629 --> 01:42:49,762
Free, free, free,
free-a, free.

1763
01:42:49,831 --> 01:42:51,264
Another year, and I'll cut...

1764
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:54,167
Another year, and I'll cut loose
from that chipmunk show.

1765
01:42:54,235 --> 01:42:55,501
Binds me.
Hugs me up.

1766
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:57,436
Finks, dwarfs, phonies, and frauds.

1767
01:42:57,505 --> 01:42:58,804
Now, the two of us,

1768
01:42:58,873 --> 01:43:01,174
we got to do something new,
something wild...

1769
01:43:01,242 --> 01:43:03,442
A new kind of kid's show
for adults, maybe.

1770
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:05,945
You told me the same thing
three years ago, Leo.

1771
01:43:06,014 --> 01:43:07,246
All right.

1772
01:43:07,315 --> 01:43:08,648
I'm a coward.

1773
01:43:08,716 --> 01:43:11,150
Everybody knows...
My god.

1774
01:43:11,219 --> 01:43:14,153
Did you ever see anything so immodest?

1775
01:43:14,222 --> 01:43:18,424
I bring a big statue of myself
as a gift for a child?

1776
01:43:18,493 --> 01:43:20,226
The pure ego of it!

1777
01:43:20,295 --> 01:43:21,961
I'm ashamed, Murray.

1778
01:43:22,030 --> 01:43:26,132
Throw a sheet over it
or something, will you, please?

1779
01:43:27,502 --> 01:43:32,872
Hey, yum, yum, yum, yum.
Hey, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1780
01:43:32,941 --> 01:43:34,340
Good.

1781
01:43:34,409 --> 01:43:35,908
Gosh.

1782
01:43:35,977 --> 01:43:38,945
Kidderoonies, look at your
poor chippermunk friend.

1783
01:43:39,013 --> 01:43:40,346
He got his mouth stuck.

1784
01:43:40,415 --> 01:43:41,814
Ho!

1785
01:43:41,883 --> 01:43:46,219
No matter how hard I try,
I can't get my mouth unstuck.

1786
01:43:46,287 --> 01:43:48,521
But maybe, if you chippermunks yell,

1787
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:51,724
"be happy, chuckles,"
maybe then it will get unstuck.

1788
01:43:56,364 --> 01:43:59,999
Y-you're supposed to yell,
"be happy, chuckles!"

1789
01:44:00,068 --> 01:44:02,268
Yeah. Sure.

1790
01:44:02,337 --> 01:44:03,769
Be happy, chuckles!

1791
01:44:03,838 --> 01:44:05,838
All right!
You fixed me!

1792
01:44:05,907 --> 01:44:08,074
I'm all fixed.

1793
01:44:11,613 --> 01:44:13,846
Would you like your
potato chips now, Mr. Herman?

1794
01:44:13,915 --> 01:44:16,749
That's a bit
from tomorrow morning's show.

1795
01:44:16,818 --> 01:44:18,317
Yeah, you're gonna know it

1796
01:44:18,386 --> 01:44:20,553
before all the kids in the neighborhood.

1797
01:44:20,622 --> 01:44:21,954
Thank you.

1798
01:44:22,023 --> 01:44:23,789
That's one of the funny parts there

1799
01:44:23,858 --> 01:44:25,458
where I couldn't move my mouth.

1800
01:44:25,526 --> 01:44:26,526
O-yeah?

1801
01:44:26,561 --> 01:44:28,160
You didn't think it was funny?

1802
01:44:28,229 --> 01:44:29,795
Sure.
That was pretty funny.

1803
01:44:31,132 --> 01:44:32,431
Yeah.

1804
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:34,678
Don't you laugh or something
when you see something funny?

1805
01:44:34,702 --> 01:44:36,535
Yeah. It just caught me
by surprise is all.

1806
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:37,670
I didn't get a chance.

1807
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,540
Don't you want more potato chips, mister?

1808
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:44,610
Another funny part was where
I jumped up with a smile, there,

1809
01:44:44,679 --> 01:44:46,245
at the end, there...

1810
01:44:46,314 --> 01:44:49,682
Was another one.

1811
01:44:49,751 --> 01:44:53,052
Then the finish on the bit.
I got the smile, see.

1812
01:44:53,121 --> 01:44:55,988
Now I'm all fixed?
Now I'm all fixed.

1813
01:44:57,191 --> 01:44:59,992
Now it's stuck the other way.

1814
01:45:08,269 --> 01:45:10,036
Gee, that's terrific,
Mr. Herman.

1815
01:45:10,104 --> 01:45:11,470
That's all you got to do.

1816
01:45:11,539 --> 01:45:14,540
Just get up there and do that,
and they pay you and everything.

1817
01:45:17,545 --> 01:45:18,611
You didn't laugh.

1818
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:20,713
I was waiting for the funny part.

1819
01:45:20,782 --> 01:45:23,582
That was the funny part.

1820
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:25,818
You mean when you fell on the floor?

1821
01:45:25,887 --> 01:45:28,321
Yes, when I fell back
on the floor, there.

1822
01:45:28,389 --> 01:45:29,655
Well, you see, the thing is...

1823
01:45:29,724 --> 01:45:31,691
Yeah, I know. You were waiting
for the funny part.

1824
01:45:31,759 --> 01:45:33,426
Well, here,
you missed another funny part.

1825
01:45:33,494 --> 01:45:35,561
Another one?
I'm very sorry Mr. Herman.

1826
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:36,630
Forget it.

1827
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:41,367
I happen to know
that the bit is very funny.

1828
01:45:41,436 --> 01:45:42,668
I can prove it to you.

1829
01:45:42,737 --> 01:45:45,571
What does it say right there -
second line, there.

1830
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:49,008
"Frown bit... 85% of audience

1831
01:45:49,077 --> 01:45:52,578
outright prolonged laughter
on frown bit."

1832
01:45:52,647 --> 01:45:55,047
That's an analysis report
the agency did for me

1833
01:45:55,116 --> 01:45:56,682
on Monday's preview audience.

1834
01:45:56,751 --> 01:45:59,919
The routine I just did for you
got outright prolonged laughter,

1835
01:45:59,987 --> 01:46:02,655
85%, Monday, 3:00.

1836
01:46:02,724 --> 01:46:04,323
You could try him on sad parts, Leo.

1837
01:46:04,392 --> 01:46:05,991
He's very good on sad parts.

1838
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:08,861
As a matter of fact,
there's a poignant-type bit

1839
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:10,763
I did at the preview theatre.

1840
01:46:10,832 --> 01:46:13,432
"60% of audience
noticeably moved."

1841
01:46:13,501 --> 01:46:15,067
They left the theatre?

1842
01:46:15,136 --> 01:46:17,803
There he is.
There's the old joker, right?

1843
01:46:17,872 --> 01:46:19,004
Murray the joker!

1844
01:46:19,073 --> 01:46:21,574
Well, say, I can do some routines, too.

1845
01:46:21,642 --> 01:46:24,844
Yeah. I can imitate
the voice of Alexander Hamilton.

1846
01:46:24,912 --> 01:46:26,011
Good. Lovely.

1847
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,546
I do Alexander Hamilton,

1848
01:46:27,615 --> 01:46:30,649
and Murray does
a terrific Thomas Jefferson.

1849
01:46:30,718 --> 01:46:33,552
We got the voices just right.

1850
01:46:33,621 --> 01:46:34,820
Hello, Alex.
How are you?

1851
01:46:34,889 --> 01:46:36,021
Say, hello, tom.

1852
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:37,857
You should have been in congress today.

1853
01:46:37,925 --> 01:46:38,991
Yeah.
You really missed...

1854
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:40,493
This is ridiculous.

1855
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:45,264
You can't do an imitation
of Alexander Hamilton.

1856
01:46:45,333 --> 01:46:47,233
Nobody knows what he sounds like.

1857
01:46:48,569 --> 01:46:50,469
Well, that's the funny part.

1858
01:46:50,538 --> 01:46:53,339
You missed the funny part, Leo.

1859
01:46:53,408 --> 01:46:55,975
I'm getting a terrible rash on my neck.

1860
01:46:58,479 --> 01:47:00,713
I was working good in front of the kids.

1861
01:47:00,782 --> 01:47:02,715
The routine I did for them was funny.

1862
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:05,985
I don't go over with these odd kids.

1863
01:47:06,053 --> 01:47:07,186
Look at him!

1864
01:47:07,255 --> 01:47:09,955
Here I am in front of him
in person, for god sakes!

1865
01:47:10,024 --> 01:47:11,056
He's staring at me.

1866
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:13,959
Oddness here, Murray.
Oddness.

1867
01:47:14,028 --> 01:47:17,530
Alexander Hamilton imitation...
Jaded jokes for old men.

1868
01:47:17,598 --> 01:47:19,999
What you done to the kid is a shame.

1869
01:47:20,067 --> 01:47:22,701
It's a shame. It's a shame the
way you brought the kid up here.

1870
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,970
Grotesque atmosphere...
It's unhealthy.

1871
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:27,473
Women in and out... decorators.
Yeah, right.

1872
01:47:27,542 --> 01:47:29,475
Had he been brought up
by a normal person,

1873
01:47:29,544 --> 01:47:30,976
not in this madhouse...

1874
01:47:31,045 --> 01:47:32,411
Hey, don't say that.

1875
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,480
A certain freakish kind of growing up,

1876
01:47:34,549 --> 01:47:35,881
freakish way of growing up.

1877
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:37,716
Hey, are you calling me a freak?

1878
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:40,586
You called me a freak. Now,
you take back what you said.

1879
01:47:40,655 --> 01:47:42,855
On June the 3rd, I'll be 42 years old,

1880
01:47:42,924 --> 01:47:45,925
and I'm standing here arguing
with a 12-year-old kid.

1881
01:47:47,795 --> 01:47:49,595
Nicky...

1882
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:55,835
Humor is a cloudy, wonderland thing...

1883
01:47:55,903 --> 01:47:59,505
But simple and clear
as the blue, blue sky.

1884
01:47:59,574 --> 01:48:01,841
All I want is your simple, honest,

1885
01:48:01,909 --> 01:48:03,976
child's opinion of my routine.

1886
01:48:04,045 --> 01:48:06,178
But children are too honest to be wise.

1887
01:48:09,951 --> 01:48:13,419
Well, my simple, child reaction
of what you did

1888
01:48:13,488 --> 01:48:15,354
is that you are not funny.

1889
01:48:15,423 --> 01:48:18,324
Funnier than you is even Stuart sloshman,

1890
01:48:18,392 --> 01:48:20,092
who is my friend and is 11

1891
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:24,430
and puts walnuts in his mouth
and makes noises.

1892
01:48:24,499 --> 01:48:27,533
What's not funny is to call us names.

1893
01:48:29,437 --> 01:48:32,938
And what is mostly not funny
is how sad you are,

1894
01:48:33,007 --> 01:48:37,343
and I'd feel sorry for you if
it wasn't for how dull you are.

1895
01:48:37,411 --> 01:48:40,813
And those are the worst-tasting
potato chips I've ever tasted.

1896
01:48:40,882 --> 01:48:43,549
And that's my opinion
from the blue, blue sky.

1897
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:58,163
There he is.
There's the old Murray.

1898
01:48:58,232 --> 01:48:59,932
There's the old joker, right?

1899
01:49:00,001 --> 01:49:02,201
You didn't want to come back
to work for me.

1900
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:04,570
You got me up here
to step on my face again!

1901
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:05,704
Now, wait, Leo...

1902
01:49:08,809 --> 01:49:10,843
That's the song!
That's the goodbye song!

1903
01:49:10,912 --> 01:49:13,412
Hey, hey, Leo!
A bunch of nuts here!

1904
01:49:13,481 --> 01:49:15,681
You're crazy people!
Wait a minute, will you?

1905
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:17,349
I'm sorry.

1906
01:49:17,418 --> 01:49:18,951
Quit it.
Cut that out.

1907
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:21,353
Come on, Murray. We'll sing to him.
He'll go away.

1908
01:49:21,422 --> 01:49:23,722
Come on, just put it down.

1909
01:49:23,791 --> 01:49:25,391
Come on, Murray, let him go away.

1910
01:49:25,459 --> 01:49:26,459
He called us names.

1911
01:49:26,527 --> 01:49:28,327
Will you be quiet for just a minute?

1912
01:49:28,396 --> 01:49:30,329
Murray, let him go away, please!

1913
01:49:32,333 --> 01:49:33,333
Crummy statue!

1914
01:49:33,401 --> 01:49:36,068
Hey, Nick!
Come on, cut it out, Nick.

1915
01:49:36,137 --> 01:49:39,438
He can't push us around!
Not you and me, Murray!

1916
01:49:39,507 --> 01:49:40,873
Nick!

1917
01:49:40,942 --> 01:49:42,575
We got to, please!

1918
01:49:42,643 --> 01:49:44,577
Please!
We can't.

1919
01:49:44,645 --> 01:49:46,312
We can't.

1920
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:51,083
Kid, I'm sorry.

1921
01:49:51,152 --> 01:49:53,852
Sorry, kid.

1922
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:57,690
I'm sorry.

1923
01:50:07,234 --> 01:50:09,501
Look...

1924
01:50:09,570 --> 01:50:12,338
Better go to your room.

1925
01:50:12,406 --> 01:50:15,007
This is
a one-room apartment.

1926
01:50:16,944 --> 01:50:19,411
Okay, then go to your alcove.

1927
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:31,590
Hey, Leo, I hope
you didn't misunderstand.

1928
01:50:31,659 --> 01:50:32,958
We were only kidding you.

1929
01:50:33,027 --> 01:50:35,227
Myself.
I got carried away there myself.

1930
01:50:35,296 --> 01:50:37,696
Well, we all got
a little excited, I guess.

1931
01:50:38,866 --> 01:50:39,866
So...

1932
01:50:39,934 --> 01:50:42,568
I'll see you at work in the morning, Leo.

1933
01:50:42,637 --> 01:50:45,571
Great to have you back, fella.
You both hate me.

1934
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:46,939
No, nobody hates you.

1935
01:50:47,008 --> 01:50:48,607
I yelled at the kid.
I'm sorry.

1936
01:50:48,676 --> 01:50:50,342
I didn't mean to cause any upset.

1937
01:50:50,411 --> 01:50:52,244
I don't get along too good with kids.

1938
01:50:52,313 --> 01:50:53,846
Well, don't worry about it.

1939
01:50:53,914 --> 01:50:55,748
Why not come have a drink with me?

1940
01:50:55,816 --> 01:50:57,016
No, no, not tonight.

1941
01:50:57,084 --> 01:50:58,617
Some other night, Leo?

1942
01:50:58,686 --> 01:51:01,420
Yeah, look...

1943
01:51:01,489 --> 01:51:03,922
After I leave, you horse around
with the kid a little bit,

1944
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:05,124
he'll feel better.

1945
01:51:05,192 --> 01:51:06,392
Right, Leo.

1946
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:09,194
That bit I did for him
was funny, wasn't it, Murray?

1947
01:51:10,765 --> 01:51:13,966
Yeah, Leo. I guess
it was just a bad day for you.

1948
01:51:15,603 --> 01:51:18,370
Bad day for the old chipmunk.

1949
01:51:20,608 --> 01:51:22,274
You...

1950
01:51:22,343 --> 01:51:23,909
You don't want to leave that statue

1951
01:51:23,978 --> 01:51:25,878
lying on the floor like that, Murray?

1952
01:51:28,416 --> 01:51:30,883
No, Leo. No.

1953
01:51:44,465 --> 01:51:46,899
Gee.

1954
01:51:46,967 --> 01:51:50,502
See you at the studio
in the morning, you old monkey.

1955
01:51:55,242 --> 01:51:56,942
You're an old monkey, aren't you?

1956
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:34,346
Hey, I could use
a pastrami sandwich right now.

1957
01:52:34,415 --> 01:52:35,981
Couldn't you?

1958
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:39,184
On rye with coleslaw
and Russian dressing?

1959
01:52:41,155 --> 01:52:42,821
Nick?

1960
01:52:46,427 --> 01:52:49,895
Guy calls us names.

1961
01:52:49,964 --> 01:52:54,399
Guy talks to us like that.

1962
01:52:54,468 --> 01:52:56,902
Should have got rid of that moron.

1963
01:53:00,474 --> 01:53:05,377
We could have fooled
the welfare people or something.

1964
01:53:07,081 --> 01:53:13,218
Could have moved to Mexico,
New Jersey, or someplace.

1965
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:19,191
I hear the delicatessen
in Mexico is terrible.

1966
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:22,761
I'm gonna call myself Theodore.

1967
01:53:24,698 --> 01:53:26,932
Okay.

1968
01:53:27,001 --> 01:53:29,968
As long as you don't
call yourself Beatrice.

1969
01:53:33,607 --> 01:53:36,508
All right.
Fool around.

1970
01:53:38,412 --> 01:53:41,613
Wait till you see
a Theodore running around you.

1971
01:53:41,682 --> 01:53:43,615
You just wait.

1972
01:53:46,287 --> 01:53:50,422
Another couple of seconds,
he would have been out the door.

1973
01:53:57,565 --> 01:54:04,870
Murray...

1974
01:54:04,939 --> 01:54:08,740
Why'd you go chicken on me?

1975
01:54:08,809 --> 01:54:10,976
Because your routines

1976
01:54:11,045 --> 01:54:15,147
give me outright, prolonged laughter...

1977
01:54:15,216 --> 01:54:16,448
Theodore.

1978
01:54:16,517 --> 01:54:19,384
$4.95 for a new tablecloth,

1979
01:54:19,453 --> 01:54:21,320
and you leave it around like this.

1980
01:54:23,557 --> 01:54:24,990
Perfectly new tablecloth,

1981
01:54:25,059 --> 01:54:27,259
and already there's dust all over it.

1982
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:35,868
You know, it's very interesting
that I left my files here,

1983
01:54:35,936 --> 01:54:37,603
that I forgot them,

1984
01:54:37,671 --> 01:54:42,140
I mean, psychologically,
if you want to analyze that.

1985
01:54:42,209 --> 01:54:46,044
Of course, last month, I left
my handbag in the automat,

1986
01:54:46,113 --> 01:54:49,114
and I have no idea
what that means at all.

1987
01:54:56,156 --> 01:54:59,491
I think that the pattern
of our relationship,

1988
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:02,427
if we examine it, is very intricate...

1989
01:55:02,496 --> 01:55:04,296
The different areas of it,

1990
01:55:04,365 --> 01:55:07,366
especially the whole "goodbye"
area of it.

1991
01:55:07,434 --> 01:55:10,135
Hello, Sandy, how are you?

1992
01:55:10,204 --> 01:55:13,605
Hello, Murray.

1993
01:55:13,674 --> 01:55:16,575
I called the weather lady before.

1994
01:55:16,644 --> 01:55:19,211
She says that it is a beautiful day.

1995
01:55:20,547 --> 01:55:23,649
Say, lady, can I help with any of that?

1996
01:55:23,717 --> 01:55:25,751
As a matter fact, Nick...

1997
01:55:25,819 --> 01:55:28,587
Nick, I do not think the effect,

1998
01:55:28,656 --> 01:55:31,957
I mean the overall design of this room,

1999
01:55:32,026 --> 01:55:35,494
is really helped
by all these knickknacks.

2000
01:55:35,562 --> 01:55:36,762
You mean the junk.

2001
01:55:36,830 --> 01:55:38,063
Yes.

2002
01:55:38,132 --> 01:55:41,166
Yeah, well, it's not good
for the overall design.

2003
01:55:41,235 --> 01:55:44,269
So, Nick, if you would just
help me put the junk

2004
01:55:44,338 --> 01:55:46,271
into those cartons over there...

2005
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:47,340
Nick.

2006
01:55:52,313 --> 01:55:53,712
Nick!

2007
01:55:53,781 --> 01:55:55,714
Wilbur.

2008
01:55:55,783 --> 01:55:59,484
Wilbur Malcolm burns.

2009
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:25,844
Campers!

2010
01:56:25,913 --> 01:56:29,514
The entertainment committee
was quite disappointed

2011
01:56:29,583 --> 01:56:32,851
in the really poor turnout at
this morning's community sing.

2012
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:37,756
I mean, where's all that
old camp chikawatame spirit?

2013
01:56:37,825 --> 01:56:43,628
I'm sure I speak for all of us
here when I say that I...

2014
01:56:43,697 --> 01:56:48,033
And I'd like to say right now that...

2015
01:56:48,102 --> 01:56:50,769
That...

2016
01:56:53,674 --> 01:57:00,345
Campers, I can't think
of anything to say.
