1
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,765
<i>Ever since man started to think,
he's wanted to fly.</i>

2
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:36,793
<i>But flying was strictly for the birds...</i>

3
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:42,643
<i>and continued to be so
for thousands of years.</i>

4
00:00:56,069 --> 00:01:00,193
<i>Man, eternally optimistic, kept trying.</i>

5
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:52,686
<i>Encouraged by his many successes,
man kept trying.</i>

6
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:56,235
<i>Through his genius
and his inventiveness...</i>

7
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:58,728
<i>he managed to get his machines
off the ground...</i>

8
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:02,085
<i>and sometimes
he brought them down again.</i>

9
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:08,414
<i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>

10
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:14,264
<i>All over the worid,</i>

11
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,333
<i>early pioneers
were making flying history.</i>

12
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:20,498
<i>And in Italy,
Count Emilio Ponticelli...</i>

13
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:24,622
<i>made what many people claimed
was the first long-distance flight.</i>

14
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:38,911
<i>There was no doubt about it...</i>

15
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:42,364
<i>by 1910,
flying had become the rage.</i>

16
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,282
<i>Man had conquered the air...</i>

17
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:47,159
<i>and people everywhere
were all agog about...</i>

18
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:50,803
<i>those magnificent men
in their flying machines.</i>

19
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:23,767
Hello, Richard!

20
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,881
Oh, Richard!
Oh, Richard, please take me up.

21
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:56,374
Oh, no, not today.
No, it's much too windy.

22
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,292
Come on.
We'll swing her around.

23
00:06:58,388 --> 00:07:02,032
And anyway, strictly speaking,
I'm still on duty. Lift!

24
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:04,910
It isn't too windy for you to fly.

25
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:06,828
Come on. Give a hand.

26
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:11,910
Oh, Richard, look at that bird.

27
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:15,651
It can go wherever it likes,
whenever it likes.

28
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:18,432
- You're so lucky.
- Yes, I know.

29
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:21,117
Oh, I'd like to soar through the air
and look down on the worid.

30
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:23,419
Right, let her down.

31
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:28,406
I think I'd make a very nice bird.

32
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:31,570
Yes, I daresay.
Thank you, Carter.

33
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,406
Richard, isn't the rigging a bit tight?

34
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,708
It seems to be stretching the fabric.

35
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:39,626
You're getting rather good
at noticing things.

36
00:07:39,722 --> 00:07:42,695
- Well, I should jolly well hope so.
- Thank you, Carter.

37
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:46,052
After all the work
I've done on this contraption.

38
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:47,970
Uh, Patricia...

39
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,463
did you get a chance
to talk to your father about my idea?

40
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:53,724
Yes, he's very interested,
but you'll still have to talk to him.

41
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,642
Oh, well, I can do that, all right.

42
00:07:55,738 --> 00:07:58,135
Tell him it will increase
the circulation of his newspaper.

43
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:01,492
Wave the flag.
You know, Britannia rules the sea...

44
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:03,602
but she doesn't rule the sky,
and all that sort of thing.

45
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:05,520
Yes, I know exactly what to say.

46
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:08,876
Good.
Then, when he's agreed to your idea...

47
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:11,274
you're to ask him
if you can take me flying.

48
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,384
Hmm.
Yes, I might.

49
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,302
This afternoon?

50
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:19,330
- All right.
- Oh!

51
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:21,248
Patricia, not now, I'm in uniform.

52
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:24,700
Oh, Richard, don't be so silly.

53
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,742
Follow me in your motorcar.
I'll try not to go too fast.

54
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:32,660
Oh.

55
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:51,937
- What's the trouble?
- Oh, nothing.

56
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,430
- Father doesn't know about this.
- Oh.

57
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:56,540
Won't be a minute.

58
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:23,393
- Well?
- Very nice.

59
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:26,270
You look just like a girl.

60
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,188
Thank you.

61
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:36,339
You know, one of these days,
your father's going to find you out.

62
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:38,353
Mmm, I know.

63
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,039
Exciting, isn't it?

64
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:52,355
The trouble with aviation today
is that too many good ideas...

65
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:55,616
are being dissipated
in too many aeroplanes.

66
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:59,164
If we could bring together all these
different types from all over the worid...

67
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,178
then everyone
could learn from each other.

68
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:03,096
From all over the worid?

69
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:06,453
It's possible, Lord Rawnsley. The French
and the Americans are well ahead of us.

70
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:08,754
- I never knew that.
- Well, it's our own fault.

71
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,727
Believe it or not, no Englishman flew
until three years ago.

72
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:13,645
Really?

73
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,865
Britannia may rule the waves, sir...

74
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:21,701
but she doesn't rule the skies,
not yet anyway.

75
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:24,099
Have some more Madeira.
Oh, you haven't finished.

76
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:28,031
Damn it.
We should rule the sky.

77
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,004
I can see you're going to be
a real enthusiast, sir.

78
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,922
Anytime you should care to come up...

79
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:36,182
No, thank you, Mays.
I may be an old fogy...

80
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:38,964
but I think that if the Lord
had intended me to fly...

81
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:41,745
he would have given me... wings.

82
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:46,060
You travel by train, Father,
but you haven't any wheels.

83
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:51,527
Do you really mean no Englishman flew
until three years ago?

84
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:53,924
<i>That's right, sir.</i>

85
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,938
Hmm.

86
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:00,254
Come and see me again
in a few days.

87
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,131
Meanwhile, I'll discuss your idea
with my circulation people.

88
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:06,200
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

89
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,900
Uh, by the by, sir,
there's one other thing.

90
00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:21,736
I wonder if I might take Patricia up
this afternoon.

91
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:23,654
Up? Where?

92
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,682
Oh, into the sky, Father, flying.

93
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:32,669
Certainly not!
I absolutely forbid you to go up...

94
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:34,683
and I absolutely forbid you...

95
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,272
to take my daughter flying,
today or any other day.

96
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:39,957
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

97
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:43,314
Absolutely, sir.
Thank you, sir.

98
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:58,563
"I absolutely forbid you to take my
daughter flying, today or any day.

99
00:11:58,658 --> 00:12:00,481
- Patricia, darling...
- Is that absolutely understood?"

100
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:03,549
"Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir. "
Three bags full, sir!

101
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:06,139
It's not my fault. Now, Patricia,
you can't blame your father...

102
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:08,728
for thinking that flying is dangerous.
It is.

103
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:12,277
But when he gets enthusiastic
about the idea, he'll change his mind.

104
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:14,962
Now, you'll see. Oh, Patricia.

105
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:17,551
No, Richard, you're in uniform.

106
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:24,936
If you won't take me flying,
I shall find someone who will.

107
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:27,046
Oh, all right.

108
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:30,114
I suppose you wouldn't like to
go have lunch at Windsor?

109
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,622
You could drive the car if you like.

110
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,417
- Me?
- Yes.

111
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:42,582
Oh! Come on.

112
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:48,528
Well, that's my idea, gentlemen.

113
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:53,419
Not a festival but something which
will fire the imagination of the worid...

114
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:57,447
which will bring together all
the different types of flying machines...

115
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:02,050
and, at the same time,
increase the circulation of my newspaper.

116
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:05,694
An air race, gentlemen...

117
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,818
<i>initiated, sponsored and rewarded
by the Daily Post.</i>

118
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,462
An air race which will show that
Britannia not only rules the waves...

119
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:17,778
but intends, in future,
to rule the skies.

120
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:22,765
An air race between the two
most important capitals of the worid...

121
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:26,121
London and Paris.

122
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:28,615
- But that means flying
across the English Channel.

123
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:32,067
Well, of course it does.
That's the whole idea, Gascoyne.

124
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:34,561
Well, the French fellow did it last year.

125
00:13:34,657 --> 00:13:37,150
I presume some progress
has been made since then?

126
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:39,356
- Of course there has, sir.
- Very well.

127
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,945
I shall leave the details
to be worked out by my staff...

128
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,110
and you gentlemen
of the Royal Aero Club.

129
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:48,275
You, Gascoyne,
will be my liaison officer...

130
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,385
an aeronautical correspondent.

131
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:54,413
I shall expect you to go aloft
as often as possible.

132
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:57,577
Yes, sir. Um, may one ask
what the prize will be, sir?

133
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:59,399
£10,000.

134
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:03,044
£10,000?
Most generous, sir.

135
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,537
That should attract fliers
from all over the worid.

136
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:08,414
That's the idea.
Nevertheless...

137
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,675
I shall expect the prize
to be won by an Englishman.

138
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:21,553
"Great London-Paris air race.

139
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:24,334

141
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:31,431
Could you add, um,
"Foreign newspapers, please copy"?

142
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:33,541
That's already done there
at the bottom of the page.

143
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:35,555
- Here are some more invitations.
- Good.

144
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:38,048
You know, between these invitations
and the newspapers...

145
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,597
we should reach every flying man
in the worid.

146
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:44,282
Emilio Ponticelli... Italy.

147
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:48,214
Pierre Dubois... Dieppe, France.
France. Right.

148

149
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:02,695

Monsieur Dubois!</i>

150
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:05,284
<i>Monsieur Dubois!</i>

151
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,970

152
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:38,275
<i>- Mon Dieu!
- Dear me.</i>

153
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:43,933
<i>Il est mort!</i>

154
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,948
Oh, am I dead, or am I dreaming?

155
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:56,209
<i>Ah, merveilleuse.
You are so charming.</i>

156
00:15:56,304 --> 00:15:58,702
- What's your name?
- Brigitte.

157
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:01,195
<i>Brigitte?
Oh, formidable.</i>

158
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:04,840
Concussión.

159
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:07,333
Sir.

00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:11,169
<i>Monsieur, perhaps it is important.
It's from England.</i>

161
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,197
<i>Nom de chien!</i>

162
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:19,225
250,000 francs?

163
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:21,431
- You?
- We must get down the machine.

164
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,828
- Yeah, What, me?
- Yes, you. Quick!

165
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:13,026

00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:33,454
Order another flying machine.

171
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:36,139
<i>Jawohl, Herr Colonel,
another flying machine.</i>

172
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:38,440
But there's no one else
who can fly.

173
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:40,359
It cannot be difficult...

174
00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:42,372
otherwise Winkler couldn't have done it.

175
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:47,359
<i>- Not that he was any good at it.
- Of course, Herr Colonel.</i>

176
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:50,716
<i>- So, Rumpelstrosse.
- Herr Colonel?</i>

177
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:52,634
You will fly the new machine.

178
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,552
<i>Jawohl, Herr Colonel.</i>

179
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:59,347
But how will I learn to fly?

180
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:02,704
Same way as we learn everything else
in the German army...

181
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,622
from the book of instructions.

182
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:08,650
Come on!

183
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:22,556
I don't mind your being interested
in the ladies. That's natural.

184
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:27,063
But it ain't natural to stand up
and wave to them when you fly past them.

185
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,981
I lost my head, George.

186
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:32,625
Yeah. You lost most
of my investment too.

187
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:34,735
<i>I told you I could fix it.</i>

188
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:37,516
Maybe we'd better call it a day, Orvil.

189
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:41,736
Go back to work like ordinary people.

190
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:44,613
George,
you just don't have the flying bug.

191
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:48,449
You don't fly, so you don't know
what it's like up there.

192
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,751
It ain't the going up
that discourages me...

193
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:55,546
it's the different ways
you keep finding of coming down.

194
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:59,766
Boy, when you're up there, you get
a sense of freedom and power that...

195
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:03,026
well, that you just don't get
from anything else.

196
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:06,862
No, sirree.
I'm never gonna give up flying.

197
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:15,398
Hey, Orvil, look at this.

198
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,576
"London to Paris air race.
First prize... $50,000."

199
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:25,372
- Whoo-ee!
- "For further details, turn to page six. "

200
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:27,290
Whoa!

201
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:35,154
<i>Somewhere out there is page six.</i>

202
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,263
<i>Where is the great Ponticelli?</i>

203
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,182
Ah! There he is!
There he is over there.

204
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:41,771
Emilio!

205
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:43,881
Emilio, have you heard the news?

206
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,896
Papa.

207
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,896
Emilio, now you give up flying, huh?

208
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,390
<i>I promise, cara.</i>

209
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:06,514
<i>No more flying.
Finito. Ohh!</i>

210
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,678
<i>Emilio, are you all right?</i>

211
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:12,172
Every bone in my body is broken.

212
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:14,857
Emilio, have you seen this?

213
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:22,529
- Sophia?
- Eh?

214
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,927
Look. I shall enter.

215
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,612
<i>I shall win... for Italia.</i>

216
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,818
- But you promised.
- Is postponed.

217
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:32,887
Come, we go and make-a the plans.

218
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:36,052
I'll buy the best-a flying machine
in the worid.

219
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:39,216
Like-a Caesar, we go to England!

220
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:42,093
<i>- Bella, Bambini, andiamo!
- Bravo!</i>

221
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:45,066
Bravo! Emilio! Emilio!

222
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:16,139
Yamamoto!

223
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:55,938
£10,000.

224
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:59,487
Just imagine,
do you know we've had 83 entries?

225
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,405
Forty from the continent alone.

226
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:04,570
Ha! Interest in the race is woridwide.

227
00:22:04,665 --> 00:22:07,734
I really think
it's one of the best ideas I ever had.

228
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,187
Shh!

229
00:22:11,283 --> 00:22:13,105
Your go, Patricia.

230
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:21,161
Another entry, from Phoenix...

231
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,942
- Arizona, milord.
- Arizona.

232
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,243
Arizona? Oh.

233
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:29,888
Well, for someone to come all that way,
must be either very rich or very confident.

234
00:22:29,984 --> 00:22:31,998
Well, as he's American,
he's probably both.

235
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:34,203
<i>I say, there you are!</i>

236
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,793
You didn't invite that bounder Sir Percy,
did you?

237
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,862
- No, of course not.
- Then, what the devil's he doing here?

238
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:41,780
I don't know.

239
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:43,698
- Hello, Miss Rawnsley.
- Hello.

240
00:22:43,794 --> 00:22:47,630
Rawnsley, Mays.
Just popped in for an entrance form...

241
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:50,123
for that little junket of yours
to Gay Paree.

242
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:52,425
If you are referring to
an official entry form...

243
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:56,261
for my London to Paris air race,
my office will send you one.

244
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:59,905
Well, considering the fact that I'm one
of England's foremost aeroplanists...

245
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:02,399
it's rather jolly inefficient of them
not to send me one before.

246
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:05,755
I say, excuse me,
if you'll hold your mallet like this...

247
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,673
you'll play that shot much better.

248
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:10,071
I shall hold my mallet
as I've always held my mallet.

249
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:11,989
In that case, you'll miss the shot.

250
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:16,880
What did I tell you? Missed the shot.

251
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:19,373
Well, I expect we'll be
seeing you again soon, Sir Percy.

252
00:23:19,469 --> 00:23:21,291
- Mm-hmm.
- Glad you're going to join the race.

253
00:23:21,387 --> 00:23:24,264
I'm not only going to join it, dear boy,
I'm going to win it.

254
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,854
Do you really think you have a chance,
Sir Percy?

255
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,868
Miss Rawnsley...

256
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:31,553
I never leave anything to chance.

257
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:49,966
Hang onto the tail.
I'm revving up. Hang on.

258
00:24:22,957 --> 00:24:24,779
Hey, Orvil, look at that.

259
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:27,464
Wow!
So this is Brookley, huh?

260
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:32,930
- That's what you gotta beat.
- Yeah.

261
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:39,164
- Whoo-ee!
- Oh!

262
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,658
Hey, you take over.
I'll be right back.

263
00:24:41,753 --> 00:24:45,206
- You all right?
- Yes, of course.

264
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:47,124
Oh, dear.

265
00:24:48,563 --> 00:24:52,111
Thank you.
No, no, the other way. This way.

266
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:54,508
- No, it's the other way.
- Ohh!

267
00:24:55,755 --> 00:25:00,071
- Oh, look what you've done.
- What I've done?

268
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,660
Oh! Haven't you ever seen legs before?

269
00:25:02,756 --> 00:25:04,866
Well, sure I have, lots of times...

270
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:08,223
particularly when you take giris flying
as often as I do...

271
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:10,141
you get to see lots of legs.

272
00:25:10,236 --> 00:25:12,346
And bloomers too.

273
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:15,319
Oh, but none of them as pretty as yours.

274
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:19,059
If that's supposed to be a compliment,
I'm not flattered.

275
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:23,087
Did you say you took giris flying?

276
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:25,581
Well, sure I do, all the time,
only back home.

277
00:25:25,677 --> 00:25:27,499
I'm strictly here to race.

278
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:31,431
- Oh, you're one of the Americans.
- Uh-huh.

279
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:35,459
Oh, well, that explains everything.

280
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:39,103
- My bicycle, please.
- Oh, sure.

281
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:41,117
Say, uh, do you work around here?

282
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,227
No. Why?

283
00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:46,008
Well, I thought that, uh...

284
00:25:46,104 --> 00:25:47,926
Well, I'd like to see more of you.

285
00:25:48,022 --> 00:25:50,611
You could have worded that better.

286
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:52,529
I'm afraid it's impossible.

287
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:55,694
I'm not being stuffy,
but we haven't been introduced.

288
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,708
Well, do we have to be?

289
00:25:57,804 --> 00:26:02,695
But of course. English giris
don't care to be picked up.

290
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:06,148
So, until we are properly introduced...

291
00:26:06,243 --> 00:26:08,066
good-bye.

292
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,246
Ah, there you are, Mays.

293
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:30,411
- Oh, hello, sir.
- I'm glad you're in. I'll have a word with you.

294
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,617
Oh, certainly, sir.
Inside or out?

295
00:26:32,712 --> 00:26:34,631
Out.

296
00:26:41,248 --> 00:26:43,645
Well, I expect you know
what I want to talk to you about.

297
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:45,563
Oh, yes, sir, the race, of course.

298
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:49,112
No, no, not the race... Patricia.

299
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,085
She's getting rather keen on you.

300
00:26:52,181 --> 00:26:54,386
Oh.

301
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:58,127
Well, are you intending
to propose to her?

302
00:26:58,223 --> 00:27:00,045
Well, with your permissión, sir.

303
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:02,826
My dear fellow,
you can take that for granted.

304
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:05,607
Your father was at school with me.

305
00:27:08,676 --> 00:27:10,786
There's just one snag, sir.

306
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:12,704
Oh?

307
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,964
- It's finding the time for married life.
- What do you mean?

308
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,801
Well, I'm soldiering all day,
and I'm rather busy in the evenings too.

309
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:23,445
Monday I dine in.
Tuesday's card night at White's.

310
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,746
Wednesday I play snook with the adjutant.

311
00:27:25,842 --> 00:27:29,487
Thursday, uh, well,
we like to end up at Romano's.

312
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,405
Uh, that only leaves Friday.

313
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,994
Yes, but what about the weekends?

314
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,542
Well, that's flying, sir.
It's the only time I've got.

315
00:27:40,132 --> 00:27:42,529
But I could give up my card night
if you like, sir.

316
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:45,694
Oh, I don't think that's necessary.
We don't want to spoil the girl.

317
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,708
You do love her, don't you?

318
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:50,393
- Oh, I do, sir, very much.
- I thought you did.

319
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:54,325
Well, glad to have had this little talk.
Nice to know you're serious.

320
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:57,682
So few young people are these days.

321
00:27:57,778 --> 00:27:59,600
Good-bye.

322
00:28:01,998 --> 00:28:03,820
Good-bye, sir.

323
00:28:08,998 --> 00:28:10,917
Well, over there are the hangars.

324
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:14,369
When you get delivery of your plane,
you will put it in the one nearest us.

325
00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:17,821
First-a class for a first-a class plane.
Wait till you see it.

326
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:20,890
Oh, my darling, it's-a wonderful.

327
00:28:20,986 --> 00:28:23,192
I'm going to be very happy here.

328
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:25,973
And I'm very happy for you too.

329
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:27,987
What is all that water?

330
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:32,015
<i>Actually, it's the sewage farm.
- What is sewage?</i>

331
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:35,180
Actually, it's rather nasty, really.
Drains and all that.

332
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:38,153
Jolly useful. Most of the pilots
crash over there sometimes...

333
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,509
- Crash?
- They don't consider themselves aeroplaners until they have.

334
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:43,427
- Oh, oh.
- Well, now, uh...

335
00:28:43,523 --> 00:28:46,209
you'll want to know
all about the practice times.

336
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:48,606
You are scheduled
for 7:30 in the morning...

337
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:50,524
and 4:00 in the afternoon.

338
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,840
- Ah, first-a class.
- You'll be following the French.

339
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:58,772
I no follow any Frenchman.
Italy come-a first or no come at all.

340
00:28:58,868 --> 00:29:02,320
<i>We go! Finito.
Andiam'a casa. Andiamo.</i>

341
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:06,444
Sir! Sir! I say, sir! Sir!

342
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,321
Sir, if you feel so strongly about it,
sir, you can go before the French.

343
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:13,924
I can?

344
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,842
- First-a class.
- Okay, steady on.

345
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:18,911
Sophia, we go before the French.

346
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,884
<i>- Who is this?
- It's Lord Rawnsley.</i>

347
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:25,816
Ah. This is the English milord.

348
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,269
Good morning, milord!

349
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:31,379
Good heavens.
He's brought his entire family.

350
00:29:31,474 --> 00:29:33,776
- Who is he?
- Emilio Ponticelli.

351
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,694
Richard says he's not only a great pilot...

352
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,708
he's one of the richest chaps in Italy.

353
00:29:37,804 --> 00:29:39,818
Never stops buying flying machines.

354
00:29:39,914 --> 00:29:43,175
<i>A great enthusiast for everything.</i>

355
00:29:50,175 --> 00:29:53,244
- Morning, milord.
- Morning, sir!

356
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,505
Righto, lads.
Heave-ho, onto the field.

357
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:10,123
<i>Achtung!</i>

358
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:36,688
Brigitte!
Oh, wonderful!

359
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:38,894
Every time I see you, my heart sings.

360
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,059
Brigitte, no. Ingrid.
I am Swedish.

361
00:30:42,155 --> 00:30:43,977
<i>- Swedish?
- Ja.</i>

362
00:30:44,073 --> 00:30:46,758
- But didn't I see you on the beach in Normandy?
- It's possible.

363
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:49,155
Come.
Come and teach me to fly.

364
00:30:52,608 --> 00:30:55,101
Oh!

365
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,855
Oh!

366
00:31:00,951 --> 00:31:04,116
Look, Father!
He's teaching her to fly!

367
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:08,240
How ridiculous. Anyone can see that young
woman isn't in the least mechanically minded.

368
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:11,788
- Good heavens, what's that?
- Does 35 miles an hour!

369
00:31:13,131 --> 00:31:15,912
Wingspan of 30 feet!

370
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:19,556
Now, when you get up
to about 40 flaps a minute...

371
00:31:19,652 --> 00:31:21,762
use the top power and you're away!

372
00:31:21,858 --> 00:31:23,680
You are sure it will fly?

373
00:31:23,776 --> 00:31:26,366
Of course it'll fly! What do you
think it's gonna do, lay an egg?

374
00:31:26,461 --> 00:31:30,106
This has the power of an eagle,
the... the grace of a swan.

375
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:32,503
- And it's a bargain for 350 guineas.
- Emilio!

376
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,805
Don't-a worry.
It's-a going to be first-a class!

377
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:36,723
Put it on for me, please!

378
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:39,408
No, I don't want that.
Is guaranteed.

379
00:31:39,504 --> 00:31:41,614
Emilio, put it on for me, please!

380
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,299
Ah, Sophia.

381
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,752
Eh.

382
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,424
All right!

383
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,342
Take it away!

384
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:17,290
Up! Up! Up!

385
00:32:23,715 --> 00:32:25,345
Up! Up!

386
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:32,442
Oh, God.

387
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,005
Oh, well, we all make mistakes.

388
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:46,156
Easy with her.

389
00:32:47,787 --> 00:32:49,896
- Watch the tail skid, Charlie.
- Right.

390
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:55,171
Morning, sir.

391
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,760
Morning, madam.

392
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,966
Morning, Sir Percy.

393
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:04,857
I hope your hands are clean.

394
00:33:10,228 --> 00:33:12,625
<i>Come on, Courtney!</i>

395
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:15,023
- Switch is off, sir?
- Switch is off, Courtney.

396
00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:18,571
- Switch is on, sir?
- Switch is on, Courtney.

397
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,777
Contact, sir?

398
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,366
Contact, Courtney.

399
00:33:32,381 --> 00:33:34,395
Come on, Courtney, you lazy loafer!

400
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:38,327
Hang on! I haven't revved up yet!
Useless lot!

401
00:33:39,957 --> 00:33:42,355
You! Yes, you! Go and stand over there!

402
00:33:42,547 --> 00:33:44,849
Give my chaps a hand, will you?

403
00:34:06,618 --> 00:34:09,304
He's not supposed to carry passengers.

404
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,277
Ooh, heck.

405
00:34:20,908 --> 00:34:24,456
Stand by, lads!
It's Sir Percy!

406
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:28,772
Make for the sewage farm!

407
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,761
Uhh! Oh! Buzz off!

408
00:34:57,447 --> 00:35:00,611
What the hell are you doing?

409
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:03,968
Whoo, that's my toe!
Get your backside out of my face!

410
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,557
What the hell are you doing down there?

411
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:12,695
I can't land the plane!

412
00:35:36,191 --> 00:35:38,397
Back to the sewage farm!

413
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:47,604
- He's gonna crash!
- Yeah.

414
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:07,935
You bounder!
Look what you've done to my aeroplane!

415
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:09,853
I'll kill you! Aaah!

416
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:28,650
- Come on, Courtney! Get on!
- Ooh!

417
00:36:35,363 --> 00:36:38,240
<i>Achtung! Halt!</i>

418
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:29,740
Is this where
the Yankee fellow hangs out?

419
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:31,658
Yes, governor, this is the place.

420
00:37:31,753 --> 00:37:34,535
Are you quite certain
he's smaller than me?

421
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,932
- Oh, yes, governor.
- Right.

422
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:38,850
Stay there.

423
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:42,590
Hey, you there, Yankee chap.

424
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,043
Oh, howdy.

425
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:50,838
<i>- Did you want me?
- I certainly do.</i>

426
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:53,619
You caused me to crash
my flying machine.

427
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:56,113
I therefore intend
giving you a jolly good thrashing.

428
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:58,031
- Ready?
- Ready.

429
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,607
I suppose you think that's funny.

430
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:09,539
- Well, pardon me.
- Eh?

431
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:11,937
You might wanna
thrash someone else with this.

432
00:38:12,032 --> 00:38:13,855
Yes.

433
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,650
Got a cold, governor?

434
00:38:28,624 --> 00:38:30,446
# Ooh-ooh #

435
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,364
You're late.

436
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:40,899
Ooh, Richard.
Ooh, you taste of castor oil.

437
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:42,817
Eww.

438
00:38:44,735 --> 00:38:47,229
Did you fix the extra petrol tank?

439
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,914
Yes. And changed the oil.

440
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,832
Did need changing.
You were quite right.

441
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:54,709
Of course. I'm always right.

442
00:38:57,107 --> 00:39:01,806
And now you're going to help me
grease the undercarriage.

443
00:39:01,902 --> 00:39:04,491
- Whoops!
- Now, come on.

444
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:09,190
Right.
You begin greasing here.

445
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:11,780
On the axle?

446
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:13,985
Mmm, it could do with it.

447
00:39:19,548 --> 00:39:22,617
Say, you've really got yourself
something here, don't you?

448
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:26,165
- Anything I can do for you?
- Well, I was, uh...

449
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:29,522
I was hoping that you might let me
borrow a monkey wrench from you.

450
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:32,015
Monkey wrench?

451
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:34,365
Oh. Well, I can let you have an
adjustable spanner if that's what you mean.

452
00:39:34,398 --> 00:39:36,618
Oh. Well, I can let you have an
adjustable spanner if that's what you mean.

453
00:39:36,714 --> 00:39:38,728
Well, I guess
that's what they call it in England.

454
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:42,277
- You're Orvil Newton, aren't you?
- That's right.

455
00:39:42,372 --> 00:39:44,291
- I'm Richard Mays.
- Howdy-do.

456
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:47,743
I'll get it for you.

457
00:39:51,771 --> 00:39:56,087
Oh. May I present
Miss Patricia Rawnsley?

458
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:58,100
Well, howdy-do.

459
00:40:00,786 --> 00:40:05,101
Now, wouldn't you say
this constitutes a formal introduction?

460
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:08,074
Well, y-yes, I suppose so.

461
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:12,486
<i>Do you have to do that
every time we meet?</i>

462
00:40:14,308 --> 00:40:16,418
Oh, please.

463
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,336
Well, I... Go on.

464
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,254
Hurry up!

465
00:40:28,022 --> 00:40:30,132
Thank you!

466
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:36,078
Your monkey wrench, Mr. Newton.

467
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,571
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

468
00:40:38,763 --> 00:40:41,352
I'll bring it back just as soon
as I'm through with it.

469
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:48,257
Where'd you meet that fellow?

470
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:50,463
Oh, I... I met him here.

471
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,203
Oh. Good-looking chap, isn't he?

472
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:57,656
Is he?
Oh, I-I didn't notice.

473
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:01,012
Come on, Richard.
On with the greasing.

474
00:41:03,314 --> 00:41:06,191
Oh, thanks, dear.

475
00:41:06,287 --> 00:41:09,068
Here. Just a wee dram
to warm me up a bit, eh?

476
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,563
Oh!

477
00:41:18,658 --> 00:41:20,481
Ingrid!
You are working here.

478
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:22,495
My name is Marlene.
I'm German.

479
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,892
But I've met you somewhere before,
I'm sure.

480
00:41:24,988 --> 00:41:29,016
- Oh, it is possible.
- Oh, never mind. We have met now.

481
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:32,277
And I would like you
to know I adore Germans.

482
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:42,634
Howdy. May I sit down?

483
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,662
Let me make quite sure
my skirt is out of the way first.

484
00:41:47,813 --> 00:41:49,635
How is the food?

485
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:52,032
Everything's off
but the chop and chips.

486
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,101
Oh. Well, uh,
well, that's what I'll have then.

487
00:41:55,197 --> 00:41:57,019
Can I order you anything?

488
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,513
Oh, no... no, thank you.
I'm just going.

489
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:12,460
Not bad, huh?

490
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:15,337
Oh. Oh, yes.
It's a very beautiful aeroplane.

491
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:18,022
- No, I meant me.
- Oh!

492
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,324
- Oh, is that you? Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

493
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,625
Well, I don't normally
carry my photograph around.

494
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:25,023
<i>It's just that, uh, well,
Mr. Gascoyne of the Daily Post...</i>

495
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,516
well, he wanted it, you see.

496
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:29,626
Oh, uh, please begin.

497
00:42:29,722 --> 00:42:33,175
That's a Wright biplane, isn't it?

498
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,531
- No, that's a Curtis.
- Oh.

499
00:42:36,627 --> 00:42:38,449
Is that the one
you take passengers up in?

500
00:42:38,545 --> 00:42:43,532
Mm-hmm. It's got an Anzani engine
in it, developing 70 horsepower.

501
00:42:43,724 --> 00:42:45,546
And you brought it
all the way from Arizona.

502
00:42:45,642 --> 00:42:48,327
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you must be very rich.

503
00:42:48,423 --> 00:42:50,245
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
ma'am...

504
00:42:50,341 --> 00:42:53,218
but we came all the way across
by cattle boat.

505
00:42:53,314 --> 00:42:55,903
We're in hock way up to our eyebrows.

506
00:42:55,999 --> 00:43:00,123
Now, if I don't win that race, I'm
going to lose my plane and everything.

507
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:09,234
Say, do you know
that you are very beautiful?

508
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:12,111
Oh, yes,
I know I am.

509
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:15,276
I also have a very good figure,
I'm rich...

510
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,345
and I'm in love
with an extremely handsome man.

511
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,605
Mmm.
Is he in love with you?

512
00:43:21,701 --> 00:43:24,195
- Well, I think so.
- Well, hasn't he told you?

513
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:27,743
Well, no.
No, not exactly.

514
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,045
I mean, yes.
Yes, he has.

515
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:33,881
- Hmm.
- Well, let's talk about you.

516
00:43:33,977 --> 00:43:36,278
All right. What do you
want to know about me?

517
00:43:36,374 --> 00:43:38,772
Would you take me up?

518
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:41,457
Well, sure. Anytime.

519
00:43:44,718 --> 00:43:46,540
T- Tomorrow?

520
00:43:46,636 --> 00:43:49,609
All right.
First thing in the morning, huh?

521
00:43:53,733 --> 00:43:57,569
Say, um,
you have flown before, haven't you?

522
00:43:58,815 --> 00:44:01,405
Yes. Yes.

523
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:03,323
Hundreds of times.

524
00:44:03,419 --> 00:44:06,392
Well, I... I just love it. L...

525
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:11,570
Oh, I have to go now.
Until tomorrow then.

526
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,968
I'll be looking forward
to seeing you outside my hangar.

527
00:44:14,064 --> 00:44:16,270
<i>- Yes.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

528
00:44:16,366 --> 00:44:18,379
I've brought the car to the door.

529
00:44:18,475 --> 00:44:20,298
Been sitting with that American,
have you?

530
00:44:20,393 --> 00:44:24,517
Yes. He was telling me
all about Arizona.

531
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:26,435
Oh, you were quite right,
Richard...

532
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:29,216
he is very good-looking.

533
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:34,587
Well, I didn't fancy
the way he was looking at you.

534
00:44:34,683 --> 00:44:37,464
Richard, I do believe you're jealous.

535
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,766
Me, jealous?
I've never been jealous in my life.

536
00:44:39,862 --> 00:44:43,314
If I catch him
looking at you again like that...

537
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,232
I'll give him a good hiding.

538
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:47,534
Oh, don't be so pompous.

539
00:45:16,976 --> 00:45:19,182
Who's first off this morning, Courtney?

540
00:45:19,277 --> 00:45:21,579
Mr. Dubois, sir.

541
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:23,593
Oh, he's one of the dangers.

542
00:45:23,689 --> 00:45:27,813
I know, sir. He's got a better
flying machine than you have.

543
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:29,731
I don't admit that.

544
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:32,128
But if he has,
it'll have to be nobbled.

545
00:45:32,224 --> 00:45:34,430
You're not going...

546
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:36,636
You're not going to sabotage it,
governor?

547
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:39,992
<i>I certainly am not.
You are.</i>

548
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:44,787
Get back. Get back.

549
00:45:52,364 --> 00:45:54,665
<i>Bonne chance, Pierre!</i>

550
00:45:54,761 --> 00:45:57,063
- Okay!
- Bon voyage, Pierre!

551
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:10,202
I think the Frenchy's taking off.

552
00:46:14,517 --> 00:46:16,339
- Shall I call the lads out?
- No.

553
00:46:16,435 --> 00:46:20,367
It's a lovely day. He'll be all right.
He knows what he's doing.

554
00:46:42,521 --> 00:46:44,726
You all right, Chief?

555
00:46:48,563 --> 00:46:50,193
<i>Halt!</i>

556
00:46:54,317 --> 00:46:56,427
<i>Today we fly, Herr Rumpelstrosse.</i>

557
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,016
You will taxi across the field,
take off...

558
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:01,318
fly one circle and return.

559
00:47:01,413 --> 00:47:04,866
<i>Understood, Herr Colonel. Taxi across
the field, take off, fly one... Aaah!</i>

560
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,826
Oh! Aaah!

561
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,950
<i>Ach, Schweinehund!</i>

562
00:47:17,046 --> 00:47:19,923
Take up your flying machine
at once...

563
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:24,334
and show those French idiots
what a German officer can do!

564
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:27,211
Jawohl, Herr Colonel.

565
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:57,325
On the double!

566
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:03,654
<i>Eins, zwei, drei!</i>

567
00:48:09,121 --> 00:48:12,957
Rumpelstrosse!
Come back!

568
00:48:13,053 --> 00:48:16,313
<i>Herr Rumpelstrosse!</i>

569
00:48:20,821 --> 00:48:25,136
Rumpelstrosse, you fool!
Stop playing the games!

570
00:48:25,232 --> 00:48:27,054
Aaah!

571
00:48:29,835 --> 00:48:31,562
How can I stop this damn thing?

572
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:37,508
Get out of the way!
I can't stop!

573
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:49,687
Oh, go away!
Idiotic instructions!

574
00:48:49,783 --> 00:48:51,605
Stop in the name of the... Oh!

575
00:48:54,578 --> 00:48:56,304
Come back here!

576
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:01,291
Hey! Just a minute!
Here! Here, what...

577
00:49:09,251 --> 00:49:11,937
- Go faster!
- Put your foot down!

578
00:49:31,213 --> 00:49:33,419
Leave my fire engine alone!

579
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:57,394
- Hey! No!
- Look out!

580
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:08,423
<i>Where's that flying machine from?</i>

581
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:10,437
<i>Somebody do something!</i>

582
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:20,123
<i>Herr Rumpelstrosse, no!
Not again! Aaah!</i>

583
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:24,439
<i>Hey, Orvil, where you going?</i>

584
00:50:24,535 --> 00:50:27,699
Orvil, you're supposed to be practicing!

585
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:41,222
Follow that flying machine!

586
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:47,264
<i>Herr Colonel, what shall I do now?</i>

587
00:50:47,455 --> 00:50:50,524
- Look in the book, fool!
- I already did so!

588
00:50:55,607 --> 00:50:59,827
- What's he trying to do?
- Stop it, I suppose.

589
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:02,224
Oh, isn't he brave?

590
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:07,403
Oh, well done!
Whoops!

591
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:19,007
Oh!

592
00:51:19,103 --> 00:51:21,213
We're heading for the wall!

593
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:23,227
Come on!
We gotta jump off!

594
00:51:24,953 --> 00:51:26,775
Stop! Stop!
Stop the plane!

595
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:30,132
- He's stopped him!
- Hear! Three cheers for the American!

596
00:51:30,228 --> 00:51:32,625
<i>- Hey, Orvil, have you gone crazy?</i>

597
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:34,543
- What do you think you're doing?
- Somebody had to.

598
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:36,461
You're supposed to be flying!

599
00:51:36,557 --> 00:51:39,339
Hey, put that man down! You hear me?

600
00:51:39,434 --> 00:51:41,736
Bravo, Orvil!
Well done!

601
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,942
<i>- It's another German!
- Can't stop!</i>

602
00:51:47,011 --> 00:51:48,641
Rumpelstrosse!

603
00:51:49,888 --> 00:51:51,710
<i>Herr Colonel!
Come back!</i>

604
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:54,203
Rumpelstrosse, save me!

605
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:57,464
Rumpelstrosse!

606
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,971
- Rumpelstrosse!
- Hang on! Hang on!

607
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:17,891
Hey, Orvil, what you doing? What's that
contraption you're sticking on there?

608
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:21,344
It's a scoop. Produces more pressure
up in the engine.

609
00:52:21,536 --> 00:52:24,604
Yeah, well it might blow up the engine.
Ever think of that?

610
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,441
- You ever think that cigar might too?
- Mmm. Ah.

611
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:31,318
No, I need the speed.
All these monoplanes around here...

612
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:33,907
are a lot faster than this old buzzard.

613
00:52:34,003 --> 00:52:35,825
Since we've been here,
I been looking around...

614
00:52:35,921 --> 00:52:37,743
getting some new ideas.

615
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:38,990
Yeah.

616
00:52:39,086 --> 00:52:41,675
Um, may I come in?

617
00:52:41,771 --> 00:52:43,785
Oh. Well, how do you do?

618
00:52:48,676 --> 00:52:51,169
Boy, you sure are pretty.

619
00:52:51,265 --> 00:52:55,005
I, uh... I waited as long
as I could this morning.

620
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:57,211
Oh, I wanted to apologize...

621
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,705
but I just couldn't get away.

622
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:02,582
- Why not?
- My father insisted on coming down...

623
00:53:02,678 --> 00:53:04,500
to watch everyone practice.

624
00:53:04,596 --> 00:53:06,897
What's he got to do with it?

625
00:53:06,993 --> 00:53:10,446
- He's Lord Rawnsley.
- Lord who?

626
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:13,035
- Oh! Didn't you know?
- No.

627
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:15,912
<i>But this is his race.</i>

628
00:53:16,008 --> 00:53:20,420
Ha! Well, I guess he's got every right
in the worid to watch it then, huh?

629
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:23,584
Oh, I get it.

630
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,653
Well, he won't allow you to...
to fly, will he?

631
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,585
Hmm. What'd you ask me
to take you up for then?

632
00:53:30,681 --> 00:53:32,887
You want me
kicked out of the race?

633
00:53:32,983 --> 00:53:36,148
Why didn't you ask that fellow you're
supposed to be in love with to take you up?

634
00:53:36,243 --> 00:53:39,984
Oh, I couldn't. He gave my father
his word that he wouldn't.

635
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,902
Richard's a man of principle.

636
00:53:41,998 --> 00:53:44,203
Oh, yeah?

637
00:53:44,299 --> 00:53:47,656
I asked you to take me flying...

638
00:53:47,752 --> 00:53:49,670
because I like you.

639
00:53:51,588 --> 00:53:53,602
Oh?

640
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:55,616
I like you very much.

641
00:53:58,013 --> 00:54:00,027
And I'm dying to fly!

642
00:54:03,288 --> 00:54:05,877
Well, I have to go now.

643
00:54:05,973 --> 00:54:09,138
Just a second.
Look, I'm going all out to win.

644
00:54:09,234 --> 00:54:11,152
Now, do you think I have a chance?

645
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,604
Well, that's entirely up to you.

646
00:54:16,618 --> 00:54:18,920
Isn't it?

647
00:54:19,016 --> 00:54:22,181
Well, yeah.
I guess it is.

648
00:54:25,154 --> 00:54:27,647
I'll see you tomorrow at Dover.

649
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:30,332
Those are the rules, gentlemen.
Now for the route.

650
00:54:30,524 --> 00:54:33,593
First day, first leg...
London to Dover.

651
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:37,046
Emergency landing fields here,
here and here.

652
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:40,114
First aid stations here,
here and here.

653
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,567
Refueling points here and here.

654
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:45,485
What is all this fuss about?

655
00:54:45,581 --> 00:54:48,362
Why do we have to go to Dover by road?
Why can't we fly?

656
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:52,102
Good heavens! You can't expect
these machines to fly 62 miles nonstop!

657
00:54:52,198 --> 00:54:54,020
You've got to reconnoiter by road.

658
00:54:54,116 --> 00:54:56,610
None of you foreigners know
which railway lines to follow anyway!

659
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,309
On my left, landmark number seven.

660
00:55:02,556 --> 00:55:05,816
The level crossing
five miles west ofTunbridge.

661
00:55:05,912 --> 00:55:07,926
Mark it on your maps, gentlemen...

662
00:55:08,022 --> 00:55:10,515
and follow the railway line to Dover.

663
00:55:15,982 --> 00:55:18,284
<i>It's a hell of a long way
to the other side.</i>

664
00:55:18,379 --> 00:55:21,161
- Yeah. What do you think?
- I don't know. What do you think?

665
00:55:21,257 --> 00:55:23,079
Can you swim?

666
00:55:23,175 --> 00:55:24,997
Look!
You can see France.

667
00:55:25,093 --> 00:55:27,298
Yes, but there's
an awful lot of water in-between.

668
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:30,751
<i>It is impossible to cross,
Herr Colonel.</i>

669
00:55:30,847 --> 00:55:33,148
Nothing is impossible
for the fatherland.

670
00:55:37,272 --> 00:55:40,245
Aren't you afraid of getting "drownded,"
governor?

671
00:55:41,684 --> 00:55:43,890
Sorry to disappoint you, Courtney.

672
00:55:43,985 --> 00:55:47,726
If anybody's going to get his feet wet,
it isn't going to be me.

673
00:55:47,822 --> 00:55:49,644
Uh, I say.

674
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:52,041
<i>Pardon.
Uh, pardon moi, monsieur.</i>

675
00:55:52,137 --> 00:55:55,014
<i>Uh, est-ce qu'il, uh, um...</i>

676
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,699
<i>landing field... Calais... Oh.</i>

677
00:55:58,754 --> 00:56:00,289
What's going...

678
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:07,002
Oh, I say! Oh, boy!

679
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,842
They're all enjoying themselves, sir.

680
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,951
I should hope so.
It's costing enough.

681
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,734
Hey, waiter.

682
00:56:58,885 --> 00:57:00,803
Thank you.

683
00:57:04,352 --> 00:57:06,941
Mr. Newton!
Orvil!

684
00:57:07,037 --> 00:57:10,777
- Wanna drink to my health?
- What, the sea water?

685
00:57:10,873 --> 00:57:13,750
No, I mean champagne.

686
00:57:16,148 --> 00:57:18,737
That was a very charming gesture.

687
00:57:26,313 --> 00:57:28,135
It is most strange.

688
00:57:28,231 --> 00:57:31,780
I have been to every seaside resort
all over the continent...

689
00:57:31,876 --> 00:57:33,890
but never have I seen a German dive.

690
00:57:33,985 --> 00:57:36,671
Perhaps their skulls are too thin.

691
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:41,945
- Come, Rumpelstrosse.
We are going to dive.

692
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:58,728
Come in, Colonel.
The water is magnificent.

693
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,840
<i>- You don't like our little joke, Colonel?
- Schweinehund!</i>

694
00:58:21,937 --> 00:58:25,293
- Uh, Newton, may I have a word with you?
- Why, sure.

695
00:58:28,074 --> 00:58:30,184
- What's on your mind?
- I think I should mention...

696
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,404
that if you continue to make advances to
my fiancée, I shall knock your block off.

697
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,322
Champagne?

698
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:42,747
Well, she's not,
uh, officially engaged to you.

699
00:58:42,939 --> 00:58:46,775
It's an understood thing
between Lord Rawnsley and myself.

700
00:58:48,118 --> 00:58:49,940
But Patricia hasn't agreed...

701
00:58:50,036 --> 00:58:54,160
and until she does,
well, I'll make all the advances I want.

702
00:58:56,461 --> 00:58:59,243
You really are being most tiresome.

703
00:59:04,997 --> 00:59:08,162
What are you doing?

704
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:11,710
Are you two fighting over me?
Oh, good!

705
00:59:11,806 --> 00:59:14,299
I say! I say!
TheJapanese chap has arrived!

706
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,478
It's Yamamoto!

707
00:59:24,465 --> 00:59:26,575
You know he's flown
all the way from Japan?

708
00:59:26,671 --> 00:59:28,109
- Really?
- Yes.

709
00:59:28,205 --> 00:59:30,890
- We don't have the facts yet, sir.
- Don't argue with me.

710
00:59:30,986 --> 00:59:33,096
We must get to the landing field
and welcome him.

711
00:59:33,192 --> 00:59:35,110
Come along, everyone!

712
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:40,289
Lieutenant Parsons, Royal Navy.

713
00:59:40,385 --> 00:59:42,207
- How do you do?
- How do you do, sir?

714
00:59:42,303 --> 00:59:45,755
- And Mr. Richard Mays, the Coldstream Guards.
- Excuse me.

715
00:59:45,851 --> 00:59:48,728
Yamamoto, excuse me, sir.
First-a class-a flying machine.

716
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,318
Thank you.

717
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:53,427
- May I?
- Of course!

718
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,345
Now that theJapanese are here...

719
00:59:55,441 --> 00:59:57,359
nobody's going to stand a chance.

720
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:01,100
He's right.
This'll be the one to beat, governor.

721
01:00:01,196 --> 01:00:04,169
In that case, we'll have to
nobble the man and not the machine.

722
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:09,539
Perhaps a little cascara
in his chop suey.

723
01:00:09,635 --> 01:00:11,457
Shut up.

724
01:00:11,553 --> 01:00:13,567
Excuse me, sir.
May I have a word with you?

725
01:00:13,663 --> 01:00:15,485
You must've had a remarkable journey.

726
01:00:15,581 --> 01:00:18,362
Ten thousand miles, wasn't it?
Did you fly it all?

727
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:21,815
Of course. First I came
by mule train to Yokohama...

728
01:00:22,006 --> 01:00:23,828
then by ship to Vladivostok...

729
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:26,034
to catch the Trans-Siberian Express.

730
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:27,569
Good heavens!

731
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:30,829
From Moscow, overland to Paris,
then to Dieppe...

732
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:33,802
where I took the cross-channel ferry
to Folkestone.

733
01:00:33,898 --> 01:00:35,720
Quite a remarkable journey.

734
01:00:35,816 --> 01:00:39,748
But at Folkestone I boarded my machine
and flew all the way here!

735
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:42,338
Four miles!
Amazing.

736
01:00:45,023 --> 01:00:46,653
- Orvil.
- Oh, hello.

737
01:00:46,749 --> 01:00:49,818
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Well, here I am.

738
01:00:49,914 --> 01:00:51,928
- Listen, I've got an idea.
- Yeah?

739
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:54,805
While everyone's still here,
you know what we could do?

740
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,682
I know what we could do
and I know what I'd like to do...

741
01:00:57,778 --> 01:00:59,600
but do you think we dare do it?

742
01:01:01,422 --> 01:01:04,683
- Motorcycles go very much
faster than motorcars. - Mm-hmm.

743
01:01:04,779 --> 01:01:08,615
If we left now, we could be back
at Brookley before everyone else.

744
01:01:08,711 --> 01:01:12,259
- And then?
- Then...

745
01:01:12,355 --> 01:01:14,561
you could take me up
in your flying machine.

746
01:01:14,657 --> 01:01:18,781
Oh. You're really determined
to get me into trouble, now, aren't you?

747
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:20,890
Don't you think I'm worth it?

748
01:01:22,617 --> 01:01:24,726
All right. Come on.

749
01:01:46,496 --> 01:01:48,414
<i>Bonjour, mon capitan.</i>

750
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:52,826
Oh. Colonel.

751
01:01:53,018 --> 01:01:55,032
<i>The name of your second, please.</i>

752
01:01:55,223 --> 01:01:58,484
My second?
Who wishes to be my second?

753
01:01:58,676 --> 01:02:00,690
<i>Oh, Jean Pascal.</i>

754
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:10,760
Colonel Baron Manfred Von Holstein
demands satisfaction before the race.

755
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:12,678
I suggest at dawn tomorrow.

756
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:14,979
Anything you wish.

757
01:02:15,075 --> 01:02:18,336
But you are not serious?
This is 1910, you know?

758
01:02:18,432 --> 01:02:20,542
I'm aware of the date.

759
01:02:23,227 --> 01:02:25,145
Tell the idiot I agree.

760
01:02:26,775 --> 01:02:29,173
He agrees.

761
01:02:29,269 --> 01:02:31,762
The choice of weapons is yours.

762
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:35,311
Do you wish to use pistols,
sabers or rapiers?

763
01:02:43,654 --> 01:02:46,052
Balloons.

764
01:02:48,162 --> 01:02:51,902
- Balloons?
- And blunderbusses.

765
01:02:51,998 --> 01:02:54,203
You are trying to
make the fools of us again.

766
01:02:54,299 --> 01:02:57,656
On the contrary.
There is an historical precedent.

767
01:02:57,848 --> 01:02:59,670
<i>- N'est-ce pas?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

768
01:02:59,766 --> 01:03:03,122
A similar duel between a Frenchman
and German took place in, uh...

769
01:03:03,218 --> 01:03:05,328
- 1817.
- Is right.

770
01:03:05,424 --> 01:03:07,342
1817.

771
01:03:11,562 --> 01:03:13,480
The Frenchman won.

772
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:22,303
In that case, I accept.

773
01:03:29,304 --> 01:03:31,701
Come along, everybody.
Let's get back to the motors.

774
01:03:31,797 --> 01:03:34,099
I expect you'll be flying back.

775
01:03:34,195 --> 01:03:36,400
Come along, Richard!

776
01:03:36,496 --> 01:03:38,702
- Where's Patricia?
- I thought she was with you, sir.

777
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:40,620
Well, of course she is...

778
01:03:42,538 --> 01:03:46,182
- What the devil is my daughter doing in that contraption?
- Going back to Brookley, I think.

779
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:48,388
You think she's persuaded him
to take her up?

780
01:03:48,484 --> 01:03:52,320
I absolutely forbid it. Stop him!
Stop him at once! Absolutely useless.

781
01:03:59,992 --> 01:04:02,294
Faster, Richard. Faster!

782
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:05,075
I'm doing nearly
40 miles an hour as it is, sir.

783
01:04:15,912 --> 01:04:18,310
Come down at once!
I absolutely forbid it!

784
01:04:18,406 --> 01:04:19,652
Marvelous!

785
01:04:19,748 --> 01:04:21,762
- It's fun, isn't it?
- Yes!

786
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,776
Oh, look, look!
Look, there's Father.

787
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,708
Let's give him a fright.

788
01:04:43,148 --> 01:04:45,834
<i>Oh, rats! I broke a wing strut.</i>

789
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:47,944
You take over the stick
and keep it steady, will ya?

790
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:50,341
Oh, no. L... I... I can't.

791
01:04:50,437 --> 01:04:52,355
Okay.

792
01:04:59,452 --> 01:05:01,945
I said keep it steady!

793
01:05:12,015 --> 01:05:14,125
Orvil, help!

794
01:06:15,407 --> 01:06:17,325
Orvil!

795
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:20,585
I can't keep it straight!

796
01:06:25,572 --> 01:06:28,545
<i>Orvil! Help me!</i>

797
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:38,807
I can't do it. Hurry!

798
01:07:14,866 --> 01:07:17,264
<i>- Did that girl fly the machine herself?
- Yes!</i>

799
01:07:17,455 --> 01:07:20,524
- Are you all right, Patricia?
- Of course I'm all right.

800
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,881
- How dare you take my daughter up!
- He isn't to blame!

801
01:07:23,977 --> 01:07:26,278
This race was organized
to help flying...

802
01:07:26,374 --> 01:07:29,251
not for brainless boneheaded nincompoops
to give joyrides.

803
01:07:29,347 --> 01:07:31,169
I tell you, Father, it was my fault.

804
01:07:31,265 --> 01:07:34,046
It didn't occur to you, I suppose, that
if you'd crashed with a woman onboard...

805
01:07:34,142 --> 01:07:36,156
you would have put flying back 20 years.

806
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,074
- You might've killed her.
- Now, look...

807
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:39,992
I knew exactly what I was doing.

808
01:07:40,088 --> 01:07:42,006
And I know what I'm doing.

809
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:45,459
Oh, Richard!

810
01:07:45,555 --> 01:07:47,473
Patricia, come with me.

811
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:51,692
Yes, Father.

812
01:07:51,788 --> 01:07:54,378
Niven, I'll have that machine
scratched from the race.

813
01:07:54,474 --> 01:07:57,255
<i>- Certainly, sir.
- Oh, not now, Father. Not in front of everyone.</i>

814
01:07:57,351 --> 01:07:59,844
- I am entirely to blame.
- I know that.

815
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,050
This is the last time
you'll go up flying...

816
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:04,639
and this is the last time
you'll ride a motorcycle.

817
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,941
- Yes, Father.
- And that includes...

818
01:08:07,037 --> 01:08:08,955
the one you have hidden in the garden.

819
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,873
- But...
- Get into the motor!

820
01:08:10,969 --> 01:08:12,791
Oh!

821
01:08:24,491 --> 01:08:26,313
She's at it again...

822
01:08:26,505 --> 01:08:28,327
Disobeying my instructions.

823
01:08:28,423 --> 01:08:30,725
I don't think so.
It's the American.

824
01:08:30,821 --> 01:08:33,698
The American? What's he doing
prowling around in my garden?

825
01:08:33,794 --> 01:08:36,479
- You suppose he has a gun?
- Why should he, sir?

826
01:08:36,575 --> 01:08:38,972
Well, the fellow's from the Wild West,
isn't he?

827
01:08:39,068 --> 01:08:42,041
- It's only a motorbicycle, sir.
- Oh.

828
01:08:42,137 --> 01:08:45,590
He's trying to get back into the race,
just as I've been telling you for some time.

829
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:48,467
Well, he's not going to.
He may have changed your mind.

830
01:08:48,563 --> 01:08:50,768
Nothing is going to make me change mine.
Nothing!

831
01:08:50,864 --> 01:08:53,741
<i>Well, go and tell him so!
Well, don't stand there!</i>

832
01:08:53,837 --> 01:08:56,810
<i>- Anyone would think you were frightened of the fellow!
- Yes, sir.</i>

833
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:04,291
I'm sorry, Newton,
but Lord Rawnsley's quite adamant.

834
01:09:04,386 --> 01:09:06,305
Not only are you out of the race...

835
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,223
but he expects you to move yourself...

836
01:09:08,318 --> 01:09:10,332
and your flying machine
from Brookley as soon as possible.

837
01:09:10,428 --> 01:09:12,730
Are you sure you told him
that I had to see him?

838
01:09:12,826 --> 01:09:15,895
Look, if I don't get back in that race,
I'm gonna lose everything.

839
01:09:15,991 --> 01:09:18,101
Boy, we don't even have enough money
to get back to London...

840
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:21,169
much less Phoenix, Arizona.

841
01:09:21,265 --> 01:09:23,087
You should have thought of that before.

842
01:09:23,183 --> 01:09:25,197
Let's face it, old chap,
he only has one daughter.

843
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:28,458
Yes, but...
Aww, shucks!

844
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:34,212
Well, I wanna thank you
for trying to help me.

845
01:09:34,308 --> 01:09:37,665
- What are you going to do?
- Oh, I don't know.

846
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,254
I guess I'll have to sell
my flying machine.

847
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:42,172
Oh, I'm sorry.

848
01:09:42,268 --> 01:09:45,049
But at least you're in the right place
to do that.

849
01:09:45,145 --> 01:09:48,502
Well, good-bye,
and the best of luck to you.

850
01:09:48,597 --> 01:09:50,803
- You know your way out.
- Thanks for everything.

851
01:10:02,216 --> 01:10:05,764
Orvil, I'm... I'm terribly sorry.

852
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,737
Oh, well.
You were worth it.

853
01:10:10,655 --> 01:10:12,957
Winning the race meant
a great deal to you...

854
01:10:13,053 --> 01:10:15,067
didn't it?

855
01:10:15,162 --> 01:10:17,272
Mm-hmm.

856
01:10:17,368 --> 01:10:19,862
If I'd have won it,
I'd have been somebody.

857
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:22,355
I might've been able
to go up to any girl...

858
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:25,903
even a rich
and a beautiful one...

859
01:10:25,999 --> 01:10:28,876
and say to her
what I wanted to say...

860
01:10:28,972 --> 01:10:31,082
ask her what I wanted to ask.

861
01:10:32,137 --> 01:10:35,781
Only it can't happen now.

862
01:10:35,877 --> 01:10:39,138
Oh, pl-please forgive me.

863
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:41,344
I've been very, very selfish.

864
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,125
I'll never forget you, Patricia.

865
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:51,605
- Good-bye.
- Oh, no! No. Wait.

866
01:10:51,701 --> 01:10:54,099
I'm going to talk to Father.

867
01:10:54,195 --> 01:10:56,017
It won't be easy...

868
01:10:56,113 --> 01:10:59,086
but I'm going to get you back
into the race.

869
01:10:59,182 --> 01:11:01,579
Well, uh...

870
01:11:01,771 --> 01:11:03,785
He'll soon change his mind...

871
01:11:03,881 --> 01:11:07,813
when he hears what the American
ambassador's got to say about this.

872
01:11:07,909 --> 01:11:10,498
Well, does he know
the American ambassador?

873
01:11:10,594 --> 01:11:13,087
No.

874
01:11:13,183 --> 01:11:15,485
Neither do I.

875
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,362
But Father doesn't know that.

876
01:11:29,103 --> 01:11:31,788
<i>Achtung!</i>

877
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:49,818
No one knows better than you gentlemen
of the international press that...

878
01:12:06,985 --> 01:12:10,725
I guess a lot of innovations have been
introduced by the various competitors.

879
01:12:10,821 --> 01:12:12,643
Oh, yes, indeed!
L... Well, uh...

880
01:12:12,739 --> 01:12:14,561
take young Parsons of the Royal Navy,
for instance...

881
01:12:14,657 --> 01:12:16,479
the fellow alighting now.

882
01:12:16,575 --> 01:12:20,027
He's got a marvelous new naval idea
for stopping his flying machine. Look.

883
01:12:31,631 --> 01:12:35,084
Uh, what's that?

884
01:12:41,509 --> 01:12:43,332
It's a flying machine, I think.

885
01:12:43,427 --> 01:12:46,400
Yes, it must be a flying machine.
It's got, um, propellers.

886
01:12:52,922 --> 01:12:56,662
- Any other questions?
- That's one out.

887
01:12:58,484 --> 01:13:01,265
You guarantee this one
will fly better than the last?

888
01:13:01,361 --> 01:13:03,759
There was nothing wrong
with my ornithopter...

889
01:13:03,855 --> 01:13:06,444
just rotten piloting, if you ask me!

890
01:13:09,705 --> 01:13:11,623
You'll like this one.

891
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:14,308
Just start the engine,
and you're off, all right?

892
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:18,624
Contact!

893
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,117
Hmm? Oh!

894
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:56,409
Gentlemen, prepare your weapons!

895
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:23,454
<i>Gentlemen, I count 10...</i>

896
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:26,427
and then you will fire!

897
01:14:27,673 --> 01:14:30,263
<i>One, two...</i>

898
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:34,962
<i>three, four...</i>

899
01:14:36,017 --> 01:14:39,757
<i>five, six...</i>

900
01:14:40,812 --> 01:14:42,634
<i>Seven...</i>

901
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,799
<i>Eight...</i>

902
01:14:45,895 --> 01:14:47,909
<i>nine... Nein!</i>

903
01:14:48,005 --> 01:14:51,169
<i>Get back to your position,
Monsieur Dubois!</i>

904
01:14:51,265 --> 01:14:55,485
<i>Schweinehund,
you are not following the rules!</i>

905
01:14:55,581 --> 01:14:58,074
- We always follow the rules!
- No! You didn't!

906
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:00,664
<i>- The French always follow the rules! Vive la France!
- No!</i>

907
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,582
This time I'll count to five!

908
01:15:02,678 --> 01:15:05,075
One, two, three...

909
01:15:05,171 --> 01:15:08,336
<i>four, five!</i>

910
01:15:08,432 --> 01:15:10,542
Fire!

911
01:15:16,871 --> 01:15:18,885
Sabotage! Sabotage!

912
01:15:22,338 --> 01:15:24,927
You idiot!

913
01:15:28,092 --> 01:15:30,106
Ooh la! Ooh la!

914
01:15:30,202 --> 01:15:32,887
Ooh la! Ooh la! Ooh la la!

915
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:43,148
Ooh.

916
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:49,286
<i>- Colonel!
- Rumpelstrosse!</i>

917
01:22:33,898 --> 01:22:37,063
Hello.
"With only 16 hours to go...

918
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:39,940
"before the start
of the greatest race of all time...

919
01:22:40,036 --> 01:22:43,297
"temperatures have reached boiling point
here at Brookley.

920
01:22:44,448 --> 01:22:46,270
<i>"Not surprising perhaps...</i>

921
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:50,202
<i>"when so many different nationalities
are involved.</i>

922
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:54,038
<i>"You will be glad to know
that the slight technical difficulty...</i>

923
01:22:54,134 --> 01:22:57,394
<i>"which it was thought would
keep Orvil Newton out of the race...</i>

924
01:22:57,490 --> 01:22:59,312

925
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,710
<i>"Tonight,
along with the other competitors...</i>

926
01:23:01,806 --> 01:23:04,875
<i>"he is attending a small
eve-of-the-race reception...</i>

927
01:23:04,971 --> 01:23:07,944
<i>"a gathering which one hopes
may foster the spirit...</i>

928
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:11,108
<i>of peace and goodwill
amongst the aeronautists. "</i>

929
01:23:11,204 --> 01:23:14,273
That's the idea. It won't take a minute.
If you could just turn round too, sir.

930
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:16,863
Could we just get your photograph?
Sir, if you turn this way...

931
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:19,931
Yes. Hand-to-hand, hands across the sea.
That's the idea.

932
01:23:20,027 --> 01:23:21,849
Now, if you could
just give us a big smile.

933
01:23:21,945 --> 01:23:24,247
That's the idea.
Now, hold it.

934
01:23:24,343 --> 01:23:26,453
I always thought
that the English were noted...

935
01:23:26,549 --> 01:23:28,467
for their sense of fair play.

936
01:23:28,563 --> 01:23:31,248
<i>- Oh, we are, indeed. Yes.
- I'm ready, gentlemen.</i>

937
01:23:31,344 --> 01:23:33,645
Well, you punched me
when I wasn't looking.

938
01:23:33,741 --> 01:23:36,139
My dear fellow, if you continue
to pursue a certain party...

939
01:23:36,235 --> 01:23:39,591
<i>I shall take the greatest pleasure
in punching you when you are looking.</i>

940
01:23:39,687 --> 01:23:41,509
<i>Well, you're gonna
have your hands full...</i>

941
01:23:41,605 --> 01:23:44,099
because I'm gonna marry
that certain party.

942
01:23:44,195 --> 01:23:46,017
I'm afraid that's going to be
rather awkward...

943
01:23:46,113 --> 01:23:47,935
because I'm going to marry her also.

944
01:23:48,031 --> 01:23:51,004
Gentlemen,
could we have a nice smile, please?

945
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,182
Thank you so much.

946
01:24:01,649 --> 01:24:03,567
- Oh!
- I beg your pardon.

947
01:24:15,075 --> 01:24:18,336
Ooh! Buzz off.

948
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:29,365
Hello!
Care for a glass of wine?

949
01:24:29,461 --> 01:24:32,913
No, thanks, old chap.
I only drink whiskey and water.

950
01:24:33,009 --> 01:24:34,831
Oh, Sir Percy. Very kind.
Is that mine?

951
01:24:34,927 --> 01:24:36,941
Thank you very much.

952
01:24:38,092 --> 01:24:41,161
- Ahhh.
- Serves him right, the greedy blighter.

953
01:24:46,052 --> 01:24:48,737
- Come, Courtney. We've got work to do.
- We can't do nothing tonight.

954
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:50,655
There's guards all over the place.

955
01:24:50,751 --> 01:24:53,436
Besides, everybody's going to
sleep by their planes.

956
01:24:53,532 --> 01:24:55,642
Not everybody.
Yamamoto's still inside...

957
01:24:55,738 --> 01:24:59,574
and, uh, I've given the Frenchman
the address of a very lovely young lady.

958
01:24:59,766 --> 01:25:02,067
Oh-ho-ho. I'll bet she's
a bit of all right, governor.

959
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:05,040
Well, you should know.
She's your daughter.

960
01:25:05,136 --> 01:25:07,917
But, governor,
she's an innocent young girl.

961
01:25:08,013 --> 01:25:11,370
Not is, Courtney... was.

962
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:15,014
<i>Come on.</i>

963
01:25:19,426 --> 01:25:21,727
Now, drop me at the American's hangar...

964
01:25:21,823 --> 01:25:24,413
then pop into Yamamoto's
and see what you can do with this.

965
01:25:25,563 --> 01:25:27,386
What are you gonna do to the Yankee?

966
01:25:27,482 --> 01:25:31,222
It's no business of yours, Courtney,
but if you really want to know...

967
01:25:31,318 --> 01:25:33,236
I'm going to arrange
that one of his wheels falls off.

968
01:25:34,482 --> 01:25:36,496
That's a bit dirty, isn't it, governor?

969
01:25:36,592 --> 01:25:38,894
If he can't land on one wheel,
he shouldn't race.

970
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:40,812
Yeah, but he might kill himself.

971
01:25:40,908 --> 01:25:43,018
There are plenty more Americans
where he comes from.

972
01:26:46,697 --> 01:26:48,615
Now, sir, just one without your cap.

973
01:26:48,711 --> 01:26:50,533
Certainly not.
I'm a naval officer.

974
01:26:50,629 --> 01:26:52,643
Oh, well, perhaps a bit of a smile, sir?

975
01:26:52,739 --> 01:26:54,944
Oh, very well.
Just a bit of a one.

976
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,301
Lieutenant Parsons, where have you been?
Everybody's been waiting for you.

977
01:26:58,397 --> 01:27:01,466
You've not got your logbook filled in
or your starter's forms or anything.

978
01:27:01,562 --> 01:27:04,151
- Meet Nelson, my passenger.
- You can't take that with you.

979
01:27:04,247 --> 01:27:06,645
- Why not?
- It'll muck up my starter's forms, for one thing.

980
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:09,138
And for another, no one has
yet taken an animal aloft.

981
01:27:09,234 --> 01:27:11,056
Nelson doesn't go, neither do I.

982
01:27:11,152 --> 01:27:13,358
Absolutely out of the question.

983
01:27:13,454 --> 01:27:16,331
- Go on.
- Oh, very well then. Fill in these forms.

984
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:22,564
Well, that's everybody... all 14 of you.

985
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:25,441
Oh, no, it isn't.
Where are those blasted Germans?

986
01:27:25,537 --> 01:27:28,702
Over at the hangars, old man. I don't think
they know anything about your starter's forms.

987
01:27:33,977 --> 01:27:37,237
Rumpelstrosse,
the great moment has arrived. Come.

988
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:39,827
<i>Herr Colonel, it is no good.</i>

989
01:27:40,019 --> 01:27:42,033
I'm a sick fellow.

990
01:27:42,128 --> 01:27:44,622
I cannot fly.

991
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:47,019
You must fly!

992
01:27:47,115 --> 01:27:49,033
For the emperor and the fatherland!

993
01:27:49,129 --> 01:27:51,047
For the emp...

994
01:27:51,143 --> 01:27:52,965
Excuse me.

995
01:28:02,747 --> 01:28:05,720
It's going to be a busy day
for our lads.

996
01:28:05,816 --> 01:28:08,214
All spectators away
from the flying machines!

997
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:10,707
Spectators away
from the flying machines, please!

998
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:14,735
- Ought to be starting them, sir.
- Nonsense.

999
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:16,653
I haven't wished the competitors
good luck yet.

1000
01:28:16,749 --> 01:28:18,571
What's theJapanese for "good luck"?

1001
01:28:18,667 --> 01:28:20,489
I have it here, sir.
One moment.

1002
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,462
Here we are.

1003
01:28:25,476 --> 01:28:27,298
Thank you, sir.

1004
01:28:31,614 --> 01:28:32,573
Good luck.

1005
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:41,876
Get out of it!

1006
01:28:44,657 --> 01:28:48,397
- Aren't you sitting the wrong way round?
- Of course I'm not.

1007
01:28:48,493 --> 01:28:50,603
You take me for an idiot?

1008
01:28:50,699 --> 01:28:52,808
This is my latest invention.

1009
01:28:54,055 --> 01:28:55,877
It's an idea I had in the bath...

1010
01:28:55,973 --> 01:28:58,754
when sitting with my back to the taps.

1011
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:01,344
You see,
the wind resistance on the tail...

1012
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,645
is less than it would be on the wings.

1013
01:29:03,741 --> 01:29:06,139
Heh. I shall most likely be in Paris...

1014
01:29:06,235 --> 01:29:09,112
before any of this lot
have even got to Calais.

1015
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,030
It's pathetic, isn't it?

1016
01:29:11,222 --> 01:29:13,044
I don't know what he's talking about.

1017
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:14,770
Neither does he, sir.

1018
01:29:14,866 --> 01:29:17,168
Well, let's see, now...

1019
01:29:17,264 --> 01:29:20,045
what was the French
for "give us the money"?

1020
01:29:20,141 --> 01:29:22,442
<i>Ah, bonne chance, Monsieur Dubois.</i>

1021
01:29:22,538 --> 01:29:26,182
<i>Ah, merci, monsieur.
Mmm. Mmm.</i>

1022
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:28,772
Wrong frog, sir.

1023
01:29:28,868 --> 01:29:30,882
<i>Bonne chance, Monsieur Dubois.</i>

1024
01:29:33,855 --> 01:29:35,869
<i>Ah. Bonjour, mademoiselle.</i>

1025
01:29:42,198 --> 01:29:44,116
Really, Monsieur Dubois!

1026
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:48,528
Uh, forgive me, mademoiselle.
I was carried away.

1027
01:29:48,624 --> 01:29:51,884
<i>The spirit of the occasión, sir.
The entente cordiale.</i>

1028
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:55,241
<i>If you asked me, too much entente
and far too cordiale.</i>

1029
01:29:58,022 --> 01:30:01,379
The trouble with these international
affairs is that they attract foreigners.

1030
01:30:03,393 --> 01:30:05,311
<i>Achtung!</i>

1031
01:30:06,653 --> 01:30:08,571
<i>Ja!</i>

1032
01:30:14,517 --> 01:30:18,257
<i>But I thought Captain Rumpelstrosse
was your pilot, Herr Colonel.</i>

1033
01:30:18,353 --> 01:30:21,518
I am taking his place.
He is indisposed, sir.

1034
01:30:21,614 --> 01:30:23,628
I didn't know you could fly.

1035
01:30:23,724 --> 01:30:26,505
Oh, there's nothing
a German officer cannot do.

1036
01:30:28,711 --> 01:30:33,314
So, "Number One. Sit down. " Ah, so...

1037
01:30:37,822 --> 01:30:40,699
Surely, you're not taking your family
with you, are you?

1038
01:30:40,795 --> 01:30:42,617
You always make-a the joke.

1039
01:30:42,713 --> 01:30:45,494
They come to wish their papa good-bye.

1040
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:49,522
No, no. Sophia, no.
No, no, no, no, no. Sophia.

1041
01:30:49,618 --> 01:30:52,015
I see you have
another new flying machine.

1042
01:30:52,111 --> 01:30:54,221
Presented to me personally...

1043
01:30:54,317 --> 01:30:56,523
by his majesty the King of Italy.

1044
01:30:56,618 --> 01:31:00,742
<i>- Generale Parlonni.
- Fsst. Fsst.</i>

1045
01:31:00,838 --> 01:31:03,236
Well, good luck to you
and the King of Italy.

1046
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:05,537
Thank you, milord.
Thank you, milord.

1047
01:31:05,633 --> 01:31:08,223
No, no, Sophia.
Sophia, no, no, no.

1048
01:31:08,318 --> 01:31:11,675
- Excuse me, can you tell me where you come from?
- Phoenix, Arizona.

1049
01:31:11,771 --> 01:31:13,114
Good luck.

1050
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:15,223
If it wasn't for
my daughter's persuasiveness...

1051
01:31:15,319 --> 01:31:18,868
and my native sporting instinct,
you'd be out of this race.

1052
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:21,457
Fortunately,
I am a very reasonable man.

1053
01:31:21,553 --> 01:31:23,759
Good luck to you.

1054
01:31:23,855 --> 01:31:26,156
At least if he breaks his neck,
my daughter won't be with him.

1055
01:31:26,252 --> 01:31:28,650
- Good luck, Orvil.
- Oh, thank you, Patricia.

1056
01:31:28,746 --> 01:31:30,951
Say, will I get to see you in Paris?

1057
01:31:31,047 --> 01:31:34,883
There's something I want to talk to
you about... something very important.

1058
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:37,377
Oh, yes, I'll be there.

1059
01:31:38,815 --> 01:31:42,172
Mm. We're going over
on Father's private yacht.

1060
01:31:42,268 --> 01:31:44,090
Richard.

1061
01:31:44,186 --> 01:31:47,063
- Oh. Well...
- Oh.

1062
01:31:47,159 --> 01:31:49,173
I'm not going to wish you luck, my boy.

1063
01:31:49,269 --> 01:31:52,146
- I expect you to win without it.
- Well, I'll do my best, sir.

1064
01:31:52,242 --> 01:31:54,064
Thank you.

1065
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,749
- Well, good luck, me dear fellow.
- Thank you, sir.

1066
01:31:59,051 --> 01:32:00,873
Good luck, Richard.

1067
01:32:00,969 --> 01:32:04,421
Uh, well, thanks.
And thanks for all your help too.

1068
01:32:04,517 --> 01:32:07,298
Listen, Patricia, as soon as I get
to Paris, I've got to talk to you.

1069
01:32:07,394 --> 01:32:09,696
It's very important.
You'll be there, won't you?

1070
01:32:09,792 --> 01:32:11,902
- Yes, I'll be there.
- Bye.

1071
01:32:11,998 --> 01:32:14,108
Bye-bye.

1072
01:32:14,203 --> 01:32:17,752
There they are, Courtney.

1073
01:32:17,848 --> 01:32:20,053
- I've done everything you said, sir.
- Good.

1074
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:23,122
Right, now get down to Dover and carry
out the rest of your master's instructions.

1075
01:32:23,314 --> 01:32:26,191
Oh, can't I wait
and see the nip take off?

1076
01:32:26,287 --> 01:32:27,822
All right.

1077
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:30,603
Don't think you're gonna get treats
like this all the time, Courtney.

1078
01:32:36,645 --> 01:32:38,946
I say, the wind's getting up a bit, sir.

1079
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:41,631
- We're 20 minutes late as it is.
- We've just got to start.

1080
01:32:49,975 --> 01:32:51,797
I can't start without Lord Rawnsley.

1081
01:32:51,893 --> 01:32:54,003
Well, can you start it quickly
when he does arrive?

1082
01:32:54,195 --> 01:32:56,592
Of course.
I've only got to do this to start it.

1083
01:33:03,401 --> 01:33:05,223
Look, they're off!

1084
01:33:05,319 --> 01:33:07,142
I didn't tell them they could start.

1085
01:33:39,844 --> 01:33:41,762
A knife!

1086
01:33:43,009 --> 01:33:45,023
Get me a knife.

1087
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:46,941
You ain't going to commit hari-kari?

1088
01:33:47,037 --> 01:33:49,051
Of course not, you bloody fool.

1089
01:33:49,147 --> 01:33:51,832
I've got to cut my way out, haven't I?

1090
01:33:55,189 --> 01:33:58,066
All right, Courtney, shoot off.
You've had your treat.

1091
01:33:58,162 --> 01:33:59,984
- Yeah...
- Well, go on!

1092
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:12,067
Away you go!

1093
01:34:42,373 --> 01:34:45,921
- Mama! Mama, he's up!
- Yes, but he's got to get down again, you know?

1094
01:37:13,419 --> 01:37:15,433
<i>Oh, Dio.
Oh, mamma mia.</i>

1095
01:37:56,191 --> 01:38:00,219
This is indeed an unwarranted intrusión
into our privacy.

1096
01:38:00,315 --> 01:38:03,096
Be good enough to remove yourself
and your machine immediately.

1097
01:38:03,192 --> 01:38:05,014
Sisters, return to your work.

1098
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:07,795
<i>- Un momento.
- What is it?</i>

1099
01:38:07,891 --> 01:38:11,344
I cannot leave unless I have-a some help.

1100
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,604
I need-a men to hold down the tail
so I can take off. Fsst!

1101
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:16,714
Men are not permitted here.

1102
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:19,591
No men, no take off.

1103
01:38:20,646 --> 01:38:22,660
Mother...

1104
01:38:22,756 --> 01:38:25,633
perhaps, uh, the sisters...

1105
01:38:25,729 --> 01:38:29,086
<i>- Certainly not.
- A pity.</i>

1106
01:38:29,182 --> 01:38:32,538
We are the first aviators
to make-a the race from London to Paris.

1107
01:38:32,634 --> 01:38:34,936
We are not interested in woridly matters.

1108
01:38:35,032 --> 01:38:37,429
I understand, Mother...

1109
01:38:37,525 --> 01:38:39,347
but it is a pity...

1110
01:38:39,443 --> 01:38:42,800
that the race,
it will now be won by a Protestant.

1111
01:38:42,896 --> 01:38:46,348
<i>Protestant?</i>

1112
01:38:47,787 --> 01:38:49,801
Sisters, don't stand around gaping.

1113
01:38:49,897 --> 01:38:52,390
This good Catholic needs our help.

1114
01:38:53,541 --> 01:38:55,363
<i>Brava! Superiore!</i>

1115
01:40:46,706 --> 01:40:50,925
Oh! Ooh!

1116
01:40:51,021 --> 01:40:52,364
Don't push!

1117
01:41:16,339 --> 01:41:18,641
What's the idea?
Damn silly thing to do!

1118
01:41:18,737 --> 01:41:20,655
Nearly frightened the life
out of the memsahib!

1119
01:41:20,751 --> 01:41:22,957
I'm terribly sorry, sir,
but I had no alternative.

1120
01:41:23,053 --> 01:41:25,162
Fuel pipe blocked.

1121
01:41:25,258 --> 01:41:28,519
You haven't got a pipe cleaner
I could run through it, have you?

1122
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:31,492
- Why, we haven't got a pipe cleaner, have we?
- No. No.

1123
01:41:31,588 --> 01:41:34,369
Oh, wait a minute.
Would that do?

1124
01:41:34,465 --> 01:41:36,287
That's just the thing.

1125
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:38,685
Thank you very much, madam.

1126
01:41:38,781 --> 01:41:42,233
<i>I'm a competitor in the Daily Post Air
Race. I suppose you've read about it.</i>

1127
01:41:42,329 --> 01:41:45,398
<i>- No. I only read the Times.
- That's right.</i>

1128
01:42:16,374 --> 01:42:18,292
Hold on, please.

1129
01:42:36,226 --> 01:42:39,870
- I think I'll get one of those, Muriel.
- I shouldn't, Willy.

1130
01:42:39,966 --> 01:42:42,268
You're near enough
to your wings as it is.

1131
01:42:43,515 --> 01:42:45,433
Come on.

1132
01:43:44,988 --> 01:43:46,810
- Right over here.
- Could we just have a photograph...

1133
01:43:46,906 --> 01:43:49,400
Oh, I say! There's the French chappie.
Very good effort.

1134
01:43:56,592 --> 01:43:59,469
Well done, sir!
We'll take care of the machine.

1135
01:44:03,018 --> 01:44:05,799
<i>Well done!</i>

1136
01:44:18,458 --> 01:44:21,431
- Hey!
- Hey, you! No!

1137
01:44:34,090 --> 01:44:35,912
Come on! Quick! Over here!

1138
01:44:44,927 --> 01:44:47,516
<i>Danke schoen.</i>

1139
01:44:47,612 --> 01:44:49,530
<i>Danke schoen.</i>

1140
01:44:54,325 --> 01:44:56,148
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1141
01:44:56,244 --> 01:44:59,217
<i>- Assassin! Assassin!</i>

1142
01:45:01,230 --> 01:45:03,436
Hey!

1143
01:45:05,067 --> 01:45:07,656
Ah!

1144
01:45:24,918 --> 01:45:26,836
Whoo!

1145
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:31,919
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1146
01:45:32,015 --> 01:45:33,837
It's my flying machine
I'm worried about.

1147
01:45:33,933 --> 01:45:36,427
- Looks like you're out of the race.
- I wouldn't say that.

1148
01:45:36,523 --> 01:45:39,400
Say, do ya think they got
any spare wheels on this landing field?

1149
01:45:39,495 --> 01:45:41,893
Well, possibly,
but it'll take all night to repair that.

1150
01:45:41,989 --> 01:45:46,688
- Is there anything in the rules against me working all night?
- Well, no.

1151
01:45:46,784 --> 01:45:49,661
- All right then.
- Good luck.

1152
01:45:52,059 --> 01:45:55,319
- Any more to come?
- Let's see now.

1153
01:45:55,415 --> 01:46:00,882
Of the 14 starters, eight have landed,
two crashed on takeoff...

1154
01:46:00,978 --> 01:46:04,142
three crashed on the way here,
and one...

1155
01:46:05,101 --> 01:46:07,595
is on his way to Scotland?

1156
01:46:56,121 --> 01:46:58,711
- Ah!
- Marlene, what are you doing here?

1157
01:46:58,807 --> 01:47:02,259
Marlene?
No, Françoise. I am Bulgarian.

1158
01:47:02,355 --> 01:47:06,767
But aren't you... I mean,
haven't I met you somewhere before?

1159
01:47:06,863 --> 01:47:09,260
- It is possible.
- I see.

1160
01:47:09,356 --> 01:47:11,849
<i>- Have a drink?
- D'accord.</i>

1161
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:15,494
Your attention, please!

1162
01:47:15,590 --> 01:47:18,563
Uh, your attention, please!
I- I have a sensational announcement.

1163
01:47:18,659 --> 01:47:21,823
Sir Percy Ware-Armitage
has taken off for France.

1164
01:47:21,919 --> 01:47:25,276
- He is crossing the channel even now in the dark.
- What?

1165
01:47:27,002 --> 01:47:30,263
Stop mucking about!
Useless lot!

1166
01:47:35,537 --> 01:47:40,237
Oh, evening, sir. Great honor having your
eminence onboard our little brig, sir.

1167
01:47:40,332 --> 01:47:42,155
I say, careful of that wing.

1168
01:47:42,251 --> 01:47:44,073
Courtney!

1169
01:47:44,169 --> 01:47:47,046
I say, I hope it isn't going to be rough.

1170
01:47:47,142 --> 01:47:51,457
Argh! Smooth as a billiard table, sir.
Uh, you did bring the money, sir?

1171
01:47:51,553 --> 01:47:54,910
Oh, I never discuss that sort of thing.
You'll have to take it up with my man.

1172
01:47:55,006 --> 01:47:57,787
Courtney,
are these people to be trusted?

1173
01:47:57,883 --> 01:48:00,951
Yes, governor,
if you give them 10 guineas each.

1174
01:48:01,047 --> 01:48:04,979
Ten guineas? I can get a chambermaid
for a year for that.

1175
01:48:05,075 --> 01:48:07,761
Do they guarantee
to get me over to France before dawn?

1176
01:48:07,856 --> 01:48:09,774
Yes, governor.

1177
01:48:11,117 --> 01:48:13,898
Courtney, there are 10 of them.

1178
01:48:13,994 --> 01:48:17,543
Do you realize this is going to
cost your master 100 guineas?

1179
01:48:17,638 --> 01:48:19,748
Uh, a hundred and ten.

1180
01:48:19,844 --> 01:48:22,242
You'll be paying me the same, I fancy?

1181
01:48:22,434 --> 01:48:26,078
Well, you fancy wrong, Courtney.
Impudent oaf!

1182
01:48:26,174 --> 01:48:28,571
Any more of this blackmail,
I'll have you thrown out of your cottage.

1183
01:48:28,667 --> 01:48:30,489
- Now buzz off!
- Sorry.

1184
01:48:30,585 --> 01:48:32,983
- Go on! Off you go!
- Just a joke.

1185
01:48:33,079 --> 01:48:35,285
- I say, Courtney?
- Yes, governor?

1186
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:40,463
<i>You'll be hearing more of this matter
when I return from la belle France.</i>

1187
01:48:48,135 --> 01:48:49,574
Good heavens.

1188
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:52,355
Sir Percy is flying the channel
at this moment.

1189
01:48:52,451 --> 01:48:56,191
- In the dark?
- He must be mad. He won't be able to see the railway lines.

1190
01:48:56,287 --> 01:48:59,644
- What railway lines?
- I never thought he had the courage.

1191
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:02,425
If we go on deck, sir,
we might hear him pass overhead.

1192
01:49:02,521 --> 01:49:04,343
Or drop into the sea!

1193
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:23,523
Five guineas each, wasn't it?

1194
01:49:23,619 --> 01:49:26,496
Ten, or we go straight back to England.

1195
01:49:26,592 --> 01:49:31,196
Outrageous!
I shall never hire your boat again.

1196
01:49:31,291 --> 01:49:34,648
Hey! The tide's in!

1197
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:38,101
It'll be out in a couple hours.
Back on board!

1198
01:49:38,196 --> 01:49:41,745
You don't think I'm gonna wait
till daylight to be caught by the French?

1199
01:49:41,841 --> 01:49:44,046
You'll have to get your feet wet.

1200
01:49:44,142 --> 01:49:46,636
You dirty rotter.

1201
01:49:47,978 --> 01:49:51,335
I had hoped that
I should be dealing with a gentleman.

1202
01:49:51,431 --> 01:49:54,788
So had I. All ashore!

1203
01:50:36,313 --> 01:50:38,423
Good-bye!

1204
01:51:04,509 --> 01:51:07,673
Just look at those magnificent men...

1205
01:51:07,769 --> 01:51:09,687
daring the elements...

1206
01:51:09,783 --> 01:51:12,373
challenging the gods, trying...

1207
01:51:12,468 --> 01:51:16,688
nay, hoping... to fly their machines
across no less than 22 miles.

1208
01:51:16,784 --> 01:51:21,387
Yes, that's what I said...
22 miles of sea!

1209
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:28,484
<i>Welcome to Calais, monsieur.</i>

1210
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:31,457
Give me a hand, will you?
No, no, no! Put me down!

1211
01:51:31,553 --> 01:51:33,759
Don't do that! Go away!
What are you doing?

1212
01:51:33,855 --> 01:51:37,115
I've gotta get to Calais to compete in
the race! Put me down, you ruddy idiots!

1213
01:51:37,211 --> 01:51:39,417
Don't be silly!
I haven't got the time!

1214
01:51:39,513 --> 01:51:42,294
I've got to get to Calais
to continue the race!

1215
01:52:52,207 --> 01:52:55,755
Bon voyage, monsieur!

1216
01:53:08,223 --> 01:53:11,963
Are you all right, Lieutenant Parsons?

1217
01:53:12,059 --> 01:53:15,703
<i>Don't worry!
We'll soon have you out!</i>

1218
01:53:44,857 --> 01:53:46,871
Aah!

1219
01:53:47,926 --> 01:53:49,748
Aah!

1220
01:54:21,972 --> 01:54:23,794
Can you swim?

1221
01:54:23,890 --> 01:54:28,397
There is nothing
a German officer cannot do!

1222
01:55:39,269 --> 01:55:42,817
The race is not over yet! We've got to
get them refueled and off to Paris!

1223
01:56:02,381 --> 01:56:05,930
Richard Mays...

1224
01:56:06,026 --> 01:56:11,588
Orvil Newton away from Calais
at... 8:50.

1225
01:56:19,644 --> 01:56:23,672
<i>La américain, you can vive who you
like, they haven't got a chance.</i>

1226
01:56:23,863 --> 01:56:26,549
The fabulous Sir Percy
took off for Paris two hours ago.

1227
01:56:26,645 --> 01:56:29,522
He's so far in the lead, nothing
can stop him. Nothing at all. Ha!

1228
01:56:29,713 --> 01:56:31,536
<i>Vive Sir Percy!</i>

1229
01:56:31,727 --> 01:56:33,837
What am I saying?
He's a most ghastly person.

1230
01:56:43,907 --> 01:56:45,441
Buzz off!

1231
01:56:47,168 --> 01:56:49,661
<i>Go on! Bug off!</i>

1232
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:24,256
Blast it!

1233
01:59:27,133 --> 01:59:28,955
Driver!

1234
01:59:42,573 --> 01:59:45,258
Driver!
Stop the train!

1235
01:59:49,190 --> 01:59:52,259
<i>Arretez le train!</i>

1236
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:32,442
Blast!

1237
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:16,078
Look! Go!

1238
02:01:19,339 --> 02:01:23,175
Hey, you!
Where can I get some...

1239
02:01:23,271 --> 02:01:26,148
<i>Françoise, what are you doing here?</i>

1240
02:01:26,244 --> 02:01:28,066
Pardon, monsieur?

1241
02:01:28,162 --> 02:01:31,710
- Uh, you are not Françoise?
- No, Yvette. Why?

1242
02:01:31,806 --> 02:01:33,628
Hey.

1243
02:01:35,258 --> 02:01:37,464
Um, where can I get some gasoline?

1244
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:40,917
At Amiens.
It is five kilometers from here.

1245
02:01:41,013 --> 02:01:43,026
Uh-huh.

1246
02:01:43,122 --> 02:01:46,958
Be a good fellow
and bring me as much as possible.

1247
02:01:47,054 --> 02:01:51,562
The honor of France is at stake.

1248
02:01:51,658 --> 02:01:54,631
- But, Yvette!
- You must go. Go, go, go!

1249
02:01:54,727 --> 02:02:00,193
All right! All right,
but I will be a good 30 minutes.

1250
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:08,632
We have 30 minutes.

1251
02:02:52,747 --> 02:02:55,912
Excuse me.
Can you see anyone yet?

1252
02:02:56,008 --> 02:03:00,803
Yes! Ponticelli is first
round the Eiffel Tower.

1253
02:03:00,899 --> 02:03:02,721
There are two more on his tail!

1254
02:03:21,518 --> 02:03:24,875
<i>This is going to be a close finish,
very close indeed.</i>

1255
02:03:24,971 --> 02:03:28,040
<i>Count Ponticelli's still ahead,
followed by...</i>

1256
02:03:28,135 --> 02:03:30,821
<i>Orvil Newton, Richard Mays.</i>

1257
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:32,390
Jump!

1258
02:04:54,831 --> 02:04:58,092
<i>And here they come now!
Here's the winner!</i>

1259
02:05:00,489 --> 02:05:04,134
<i>It's Richard Mays!
Richard Mays of England!</i>

1260
02:05:18,615 --> 02:05:20,437
You get ready to jump now!

1261
02:05:43,837 --> 02:05:46,906
- Ponticelli. Ah, Ponticelli! You all right?
- Eh?

1262
02:05:47,002 --> 02:05:49,687
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

1263
02:05:49,783 --> 02:05:51,893
<i>Emilio! Emilio!</i>

1264
02:05:51,989 --> 02:05:57,455
Emilio! Ohh!

1265
02:06:04,073 --> 02:06:06,374
Patricia?

1266
02:06:06,470 --> 02:06:10,306
Oh, Richard! Oh, Richard!
You won!

1267
02:06:10,402 --> 02:06:15,389
<i>Oh, Richard! You won! You won!
You won! I'm so pleased.</i>

1268
02:06:15,485 --> 02:06:18,362
- What happened to Ponticelli?
- Well, his machine caught fire.

1269
02:06:18,458 --> 02:06:22,102
Orvil was marvelous!
He had to stop to pick him up.

1270
02:06:22,198 --> 02:06:24,596
He could have won though.

1271
02:06:25,938 --> 02:06:28,144
Hey, Richard! Richard.

1272
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:30,254
Richard, congratulations.

1273
02:06:31,597 --> 02:06:34,186
Well done, Richard!
Congratulations!

1274
02:06:34,282 --> 02:06:37,926
Well, you deserve it more than I do.
It was a wonderful thing you did.

1275
02:06:38,022 --> 02:06:40,228
You'd have done the same thing
if you'd have seen him.

1276
02:06:40,324 --> 02:06:42,721
Well, you did it.

1277
02:06:42,817 --> 02:06:44,927
Let's call it a tie.
We'll share the prize.

1278
02:06:49,530 --> 02:06:53,175
The city of Paris
salutes the gallant victor!

1279
02:06:57,490 --> 02:07:00,271
Pierre Dubois is coming!

1280
02:07:31,056 --> 02:07:32,878
Pierre!

1281
02:07:36,618 --> 02:07:39,016
You remember me, don't you?

1282
02:07:39,112 --> 02:07:43,332
<i>- Yes, of course. You-You are... You are...
- Betty.</i>

1283
02:07:43,428 --> 02:07:46,592
Betty! Of course. Oh.
How could I ever forget?

1284
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:49,086
Every time I look at you,
my heart sings.

1285
02:07:49,182 --> 02:07:51,292
Oh!

1286
02:07:53,018 --> 02:07:55,128
Will you pardon me?

1287
02:07:55,224 --> 02:07:59,251
I better have a look at my undercarriage.
It's been taking an awful beating.

1288
02:08:01,841 --> 02:08:03,663
I think we ought to go
and find somewhere to put...

1289
02:08:03,759 --> 02:08:06,636
We must have your photograph
by your machine, monsieur.

1290
02:08:06,828 --> 02:08:10,280
Over here. This way.

1291
02:08:10,472 --> 02:08:12,486
And now you stop flying, huh?

1292
02:08:12,582 --> 02:08:14,500
- Do I have to?
- You have to.

1293
02:08:14,596 --> 02:08:16,514
Not for me, but for bambinos.

1294
02:08:16,610 --> 02:08:20,158
By now they're used to it.

1295
02:08:20,254 --> 02:08:23,994
- Another one?
- Uh-huh.

1296
02:08:24,090 --> 02:08:26,679
In that case, I give up.

1297
02:08:26,775 --> 02:08:29,844
- Emilio.
- Sophia.

1298
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:33,297
Turn around.

1299
02:08:53,149 --> 02:08:56,409
- Whoops!
- Oh!

1300
02:08:58,423 --> 02:09:01,588
<i>So ended the 1910 air race.</i>

1301
02:09:01,684 --> 02:09:05,808
<i>- The winner's time:
25 hours, 11 minutes.</i>

1302
02:09:12,233 --> 02:09:17,891
<i>Today the same distance can be covered
by supersonic jets in seven minutes...</i>

1303
02:09:19,138 --> 02:09:22,591
<i>but it can take longer.</i>

1304
02:09:26,139 --> 02:09:28,057
May I have your attention, please?

1305
02:09:28,153 --> 02:09:31,989
We regret to announce that the departure
of all planes from London to Paris...

1306
02:09:32,085 --> 02:09:34,387
- have been delayed again,
owing to bad weather.

1307
02:09:34,482 --> 02:09:36,784
Buses are waiting outside
to take you back to your hotels.

1308
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:40,237
Will you all come this way, please?
Will you all follow me?
