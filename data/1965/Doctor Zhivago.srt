1
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,355
What are they like, these girls?

2
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,606
They're very good.

3
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,066
Bit wild.

4
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,277
Spend their money quickly, work hard.

5
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,071
- Are they literate?
- Some of them.

6
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:14,118
In reformatories since being picked up.
Jobs like this. It's degrading.

7
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,913
You shouldn't use
human beings to move earth.

8
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:20,040
- No.
- And it's not efficient.

9
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,252
If they'd give me two more excavators
I'd be a year ahead.

10
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,129
You're an impatient generation.

11
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,756
- Weren't you?
- Yes, we were.

12
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,091
Very.

13
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,596
Don't be too impatient, Comrade Engineer.
We've come very far, very fast.

14
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,930
I know, Comrade General.

15
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,267
Yes, but do you know what it cost?

16
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,770
There were children in those days
who lived off human flesh.

17
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,023
Did you know that?

18
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,951
What is your interest in this girl,
Comrade General?

19
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,578
She may be my brother's child.

20
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,413
- Yuri Andreyevich?
- Yes.

21
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:03,291
My half brother, I should say.

22
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:08,922
If she is, she's also Lara's child.

23
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,259
The Lara?

24
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,179
The Lara, yes.

25
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,723
This is...

26
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,684
...a new edition
of the Lara poems.

27
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,519
Yes, I know.

28
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:27,691
- We admire your brother very much.
- Yes. Everybody seems to, now.

29
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,278
We couldn't admire him when
we weren't allowed to read him.

30
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,989
No.

31
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,090
Come in.

32
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,389
I sent for you, comrade.

33
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,891
You're not in any trouble.

34
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:16,116
I'm General Yevgraf
Andreyevich Zhivago.

35
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,535
I'm looking for someone.

36
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,954
Do you understand?

37
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,253
The person I'm looking for
would be my niece.

38
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,466
Please sit down.

39
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,430
Your name is...?

40
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:41,141
Tonya Komarov, Comrade General.

41
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,143
They found you in Mongolia?

42
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,230
- Yes, Comrade General.
- What were you doing there?

43
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:51,151
- I was lost, Comrade General.
- How did you come to be lost?

44
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:55,112
- I've forgotten.
- Was Komarovsky your father's name?

45
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,197
I suppose so, Comrade General.

46
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,074
You suppose so?

47
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,576
It's a common name.

48
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,869
Do you remember your father?

49
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,370
No.

50
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,624
Do you remember your mother?

51
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,461
Yes, I remember my mother.

52
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,505
- What was her name?
- Mummy.

53
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,716
What was she like?

54
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,218
I mean, what did she look like?

55
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,763
Big.

56
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,848
Big?

57
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:27,061
I was little. She looked big.

58
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,821
- Can you read?
- Yes.

59
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,450
"Lara: A Cycle of Poems
by Y.A. Zhivago. "

60
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,745
Not me. My half brother.

61
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,916
The person I'm looking for...

62
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,252
...would be this man's daughter.

63
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,800
This would be her mother.

64
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,305
"Lara. "

65
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:08,520
Did anybody ever
call your mother Lara?

66
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,605
I don't know.

67
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,690
I don't think so.

68
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:17,070
She's nice.

69
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:21,782
I'm not your niece, Comrade General.

70
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,826
I'm nobody's idea of an uncle.

71
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,287
But if this man were my father,
I should want to know.

72
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,749
Did your mother ever tell you
your father was a poet?

73
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,127
Comrade General,
my father wasn't a poet.

74
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,712
What was your father?

75
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,881
Not a poet.

76
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,929
Did you like your father?

77
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:44,472
I've forgotten.

78
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,100
But you liked your mother.

79
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,184
Yes, of course.

80
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,483
Does the name Strelnikov mean
anything to you? Strelnikov?

81
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,154
Varykino?

82
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,365
That's a place, not a person.

83
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,535
- Gromeko?
- Gromeko.

84
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,162
Yes.

85
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,498
You see...

86
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,418
...he lost his mother...

87
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,879
...at about the same age you were...

88
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,423
...when your mother...

89
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,134
...lost you.

90
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,221
And in the same part of the world.

91
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:58,189
"Now is life's artful triumph
of vanities destroyed...

92
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,526
...for the spirit has vanished
from its tabernacle.

93
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,193
Its clay groweth black.

94
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,697
The vessel is shattered,
voiceless, emotionless...

95
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,993
...dead. Committing
which unto the grave... "

96
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,903
Yuri!

97
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,353
You and your husband will dine
with us, Madame Gromeko.

98
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,355
Thank you, Father.

99
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,150
Will you lie down then, Yuri?

100
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,613
Your mummy and I were
great, great friends, you know.

101
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,409
So now we are going to look after you.

102
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,160
Thank you.

103
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,917
That's Mother's!

104
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,335
It's yours now.

105
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,587
Yes, Yuri, Mummy left it to you.

106
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,047
In her will.

107
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,134
Do you know what a will is, old chap?

108
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,010
Money.

109
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,304
No, Yuri, just this.

110
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,223
Your daddy has all...

111
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,267
Can you play it?

112
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,811
Thought all the people here
could play the balalaika.

113
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,147
You don't live here, do you?

114
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,565
No, we live in Moscow.

115
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,319
That's a long way from here.
But you'll like Moscow.

116
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,196
- Won't he?
In a bit.

117
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,949
Takes time to get used
to things, doesn't it?

118
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:57,410
Mother could play it.

119
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,997
Well, your mother was an artist, Yuri.

120
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:05,793
She could make this common little
instrument sound like two guitars.

121
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,378
Your mother had a gift.

122
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,547
Perhaps Yuri's got a gift.

123
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,048
Would you like lessons?

124
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,468
I can't play it.

125
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,768
Say good night to Yuri, Tonya.

126
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:25,354
He's your brother now.

127
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,402
Good night, Yuri.

128
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,946
- Good night, old chap.
- Good night.

129
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:51,482
The Gromekos didn't know
what to make of him.

130
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:55,695
He made his reputation as a poet
while he was studying to be a doctor.

131
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,407
He said that poetry was no more
a vocation than good health.

132
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,492
What he needed was a job.

133
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,952
Pretty?

134
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,620
Very.

135
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,128
It's their right to be pretty.

136
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:17,759
- What do you do next year, Zhivago?
- I thought of general practice.

137
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:20,178
Think about doing pure research.

138
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,015
It's exciting, important.
Can be beautiful.

139
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:24,432
General practice.

140
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,309
Life. He wants to see life.

141
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,938
Well, you'll find that pretty creatures
do ugly things to people.

142
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:10,163
What's your name?

143
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:13,333
- Antipov.
- Address?

144
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:14,960
15 Petrovka.

145
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,088
- I'll have these.
- We have permission from the police.

146
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:20,924
Yes? Well, you claim them
at the station.

147
00:22:21,092 --> 00:22:24,134
- When?
- Now, if you like.

148
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,096
- Very well.
- Pasha! He's my brother.

149
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,724
Well, take him home, miss.

150
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,309
Before he gets into trouble.

151
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,401
Pasha, please.

152
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,361
It's got to be done.

153
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,030
Pasha, why has it got to be done?

154
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,699
For them. For the Revolution.

155
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,951
Pasha, they don't want a revolution.

156
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:51,912
They do. They don't know it yet,
but that's what they want.

157
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:53,914
Give me some of those, comrade.

158
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,418
Pasha?

159
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,961
Are you a Bolshevik?

160
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:02,715
No, the Bolsheviks don't like me,
and I don't like them.

161
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,632
They don't know right from wrong.

162
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:08,345
Pasha Antipov, you're an awful prig.

163
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,479
Why did you tell him
I was your brother?

164
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,981
What else could I have told him?

165
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,734
You could've told him
I was your fiancé.

166
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,111
Pasha, don't be silly. I'm...

167
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:32,953
Monsieur Komarovsky has come
to see my mother on business.

168
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,791
People gossip round here.

169
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:37,459
It's the system, Lara.

170
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,462
People will be different
after the Revolution.

171
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:43,381
Will you come?

172
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:45,257
No, Pasha.

173
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:51,097
I've got exams to take, Pasha.
I've got to get my scholarship.

174
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:17,791
Hello, Auntie.

175
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:19,875
There's a letter for you.

176
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,586
From Paris.

177
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,756
- Lovely writing.
- Lovely. She's coming home next month.

178
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:30,301
Tonya? Oh, that's good.

179
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,980
He does seem
to be very well-informed.

180
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,858
And such a handsome figure of a...

181
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,651
Good evening, maman.

182
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,820
- Madame.
- Larissa.

183
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:51,574
You can work in there, dear.
Monsieur Komarovsky's here.

184
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:13,470
Good evening, Larissa.

185
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,556
Good evening, monsieur.

186
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,189
He advises some very important people.

187
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,648
Yes, I know.

188
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,817
I believe he has government connections.

189
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,527
I don't know, I'm sure.

190
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:32,073
Isn't he very expensive?

191
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:35,577
Monsieur Komarovsky advises me
out of kindness, baroness.

192
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:37,537
He was a friend of my late husband's.

193
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:40,582
- Oh, I see.
- Allow me.

194
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:13,114
Tuesday, if I can, my dear. Bye.

195
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,715
Where did you get this?

196
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,968
Friend gave it to me, monsieur.

197
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,803
You're not to go to this
"peaceful" demonstration.

198
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:37,054
No, monsieur.

199
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,139
May not be as peaceful as they think.

200
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:42,810
That's all I have to say.
Tell your friend she's a silly creature.

201
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,063
Yes, monsieur.

202
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,118
How old are you now?

203
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:00,745
Seventeen, monsieur.

204
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:17,654
Hundred and three.

205
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:21,784
Oh, dear. And I was
so looking forward to it.

206
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:25,163
Oh, never mind.
I'll be all right here.

207
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:28,290
You will take Lara, won't you,
Victor Ippolitovich?

208
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,377
So stupid of me.
It's her first long gown...

209
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:38,175
- I think you'd better call it right off.
- Yes, I'll stay with you.

210
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:41,470
Nonsense, I'll be perfectly
all right. I've got a book.

211
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,223
So disappointing for her,
Victor Ippolitovich.

212
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:48,477
There's so little opportunity
to mix with good society.

213
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,814
Very well, get your coat.

214
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,569
We're late, if we're going.
I want to avoid Kropotkin Street.

215
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:39,154
"Brotherhood and freedom. "
Yuri, what splendid words.

216
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,282
"Justice, equality and bread. "

217
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:45,201
Don't you think they're splendid?

218
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:46,869
Yes, I do.

219
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,662
"Brotherhood and freedom. "

220
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,542
Brotherhood and fiddlesticks,
you're frozen through.

221
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:56,463
You've no right, Anushka.
It isn't fair.

222
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:03,761
Ah! We'd given you up, monsieur.

223
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:06,680
My niece. Coat, Lara?

224
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,605
Come, my dear.

225
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,133
How's the foie de veau Gascogne?

226
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:44,760
As always, monsieur.

227
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:48,515
- All right, not too much...
Not too much mustard, monsieur.

228
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:54,437
Oui, mademoiselle.

229
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:57,899
Wine, monsieur?
- A little light wine, yes.

230
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,693
Oui, monsieur. Mademoiselle?

231
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,030
This place must be dreadfully expensive,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

232
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:09,743
It is. Why not "Victor Ippolitovich"?

233
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,830
I can't.

234
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,236
Mother made this dress.

235
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,114
Very nice.

236
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:47,407
She's clever, isn't she?

237
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:50,410
Your mother? Yes. Fine little woman.

238
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:36,413
No doubt they'll sing in tune
after the Revolution.

239
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:40,646
Prepare!

240
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,501
Mount!

241
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,119
Draw sabers.

242
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,324
Charge!

243
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:15,591
Mama!

244
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:46,581
What, what...?

245
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,124
What?

246
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:21,866
Good night, dear.

247
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:25,661
Good night, Victor Ippolitovich.

248
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,553
Go inside your houses, please.

249
00:37:41,804 --> 00:37:46,140
All these people will be taken care of.
Go inside, please.

250
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:51,019
All these people will be taken care of.
Go inside, please.

251
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,652
Get inside.

252
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,909
Yuri, please. No trouble.

253
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:07,495
Take him inside,
or I'll put him under arrest.

254
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:12,375
Yuri, I beg you.
Tonya's coming home tomorrow.

255
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:02,843
Yuri!

256
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:05,345
Tonya!

257
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,493
Yuri?

258
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:34,541
Well!

259
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,673
Daddy!

260
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,805
There, now. That's enough.

261
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:52,849
Your mother, your mother.

262
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,480
Mummy!

263
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:07,281
Mummy, how are you?

264
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:11,243
Me? Fit as a fiddle.

265
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:13,079
Turn round.

266
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:18,793
Well, they've taught her something.

267
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:30,679
- Oh-ho! Look at that.
- Isnt Yuri looking well, Tonya?

268
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:32,765
Yes. Well, let's get along, dear.

269
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:35,434
Yes, run along, you two.

270
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:40,940
Oh, I bought you this.

271
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:43,359
It has a piece in it
about young Russian poets.

272
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:46,904
Oh, good, thank you.
Does it mention me?

273
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:49,824
It begins with you. You're the best.

274
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:52,828
Very intelligent nation, the French.

275
00:40:53,037 --> 00:40:54,955
They have their heads together.

276
00:40:55,206 --> 00:40:57,541
Yes, they're looking at the paper.

277
00:40:57,834 --> 00:40:59,417
They're head over heels.

278
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:01,920
Anushka, stop it!

279
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:05,799
Good marriages are made in heaven.
Or some such place.

280
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:17,768
- Victor Ippolitovich?
Pasha.

281
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,983
I want to talk to you.

282
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:25,318
No, Pasha.

283
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,362
It's important.

284
00:41:28,865 --> 00:41:30,282
All right.

285
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:38,747
Pasha!

286
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,709
How did you do it?

287
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,627
I didn't.

288
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:46,172
A dragoon did.

289
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:50,217
Oh, Pasha, darling!

290
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:52,595
Come, come.

291
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,015
Where's your mother?

292
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:57,600
Asleep.

293
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:00,728
Pasha.

294
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:17,161
Pasha, I can't deal with this.

295
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:18,914
Have you got any iodine?

296
00:42:19,165 --> 00:42:20,749
- Yes, but...
- Get it.

297
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:40,351
Pasha, darling!

298
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:45,564
Pasha, you must go to a hospital.

299
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:48,485
I daren't for a day or two.

300
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,864
- Will you do something for me?
- Oh, yes. What?

301
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:55,784
Hide this.

302
00:43:01,082 --> 00:43:02,874
Oh, throw it away!

303
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:07,545
No. There'll be no more
peaceful demonstrations.

304
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:11,340
There were women and children, Lara,
and they rode them down.

305
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:13,759
Starving women, asking for bread.

306
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:18,556
Up on Tamskaya Avenue, the pigs
were eating, drinking and dancing.

307
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:20,392
Hide it for me.

308
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,022
Thanks, comrade.

309
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:28,650
Oh, Pasha, darling,
I'm not your comrade.

310
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:30,693
Lara?

311
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:36,115
- Yes?
- Lara, who's there?

312
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:38,951
It's only Pasha.

313
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:44,581
- You came in very late last night, dear.
- The time went so quickly.

314
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,251
Good.

315
00:43:47,378 --> 00:43:50,421
- Are you going to church?
- Yes.

316
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:05,436
You know what our Lord said
to the woman taken in adultery?

317
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:09,189
Yes, Father.
He said, "Go and sin no more. "

318
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:10,858
And did she?

319
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:14,612
- I don't know, Father.
- Nobody does, child.

320
00:44:15,448 --> 00:44:18,825
The flesh is not weak. It is strong.

321
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:22,954
Only the sacrament of marriage
will contain it. Remember that.

322
00:44:51,484 --> 00:44:55,820
Monsieur, it's number six
this evening, sir.

323
00:44:56,072 --> 00:44:58,406
The most important person here.

324
00:45:09,377 --> 00:45:14,047
- Sorry I'm late.
- I've been waiting nearly an hour, Victor.

325
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:17,133
- Have you ordered?
- No.

326
00:45:17,343 --> 00:45:20,720
Well, you should have done.

327
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:43,576
You chose it, Victor.

328
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:52,042
- You've grown up a lot, haven't you?
- Yes.

329
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:55,129
- What did you tell your mama tonight?
- Victor, don't.

330
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:57,089
Aww.

331
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:00,134
- May I smoke?
- Yes, of course.

332
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:08,475
You like it, don't you? Cigar smoke.

333
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:11,187
Come along, my dear.

334
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:22,031
Drink, drink, drink.

335
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:23,366
Up, up.

336
00:46:23,576 --> 00:46:27,120
Up. Up, up, up.

337
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:45,597
Where did you tell her
we were going, your mama?

338
00:46:46,307 --> 00:46:47,682
She didn't ask.

339
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:49,893
- That's because she knows.
- No, she doesn't.

340
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:54,272
You'd both take an oath she doesn't,
but she does. You both know she does.

341
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:57,192
- Victor, don't.
- What?

342
00:46:57,443 --> 00:46:59,986
- Torment me.
- Torment?

343
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:02,155
What a little hypocrite it is.

344
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:07,286
I'm going now, Victor.

345
00:47:07,496 --> 00:47:08,662
Well, if you like, dear.

346
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:15,001
You see, you'll always come back.

347
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:24,593
Stay, darling.

348
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:28,764
Stay.

349
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:30,785
Wake up! You take this and you show it
to someone if you lose your way.

350
00:48:30,953 --> 00:48:34,664
Professor Boris Kurt.
You find him! Now, go on.

351
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:36,457
Professor Boris Kurt!

352
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,934
But, Boris, this is genius.

353
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:59,480
Oh? I thought it was Rachmaninoff.
I'm going for a smoke.

354
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,160
How's the general practitioner?

355
00:49:11,411 --> 00:49:15,413
- A bit scared of his finals.
- I don't think he need be.

356
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:19,541
How do you like the idea of marrying
a general practitioner?

357
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:22,502
I like it very much.
But no general practitioner's asked me.

358
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:26,048
No? I thought you nomads
were hot-blooded?

359
00:49:26,257 --> 00:49:30,970
A slow lot, these general practitioners.
How do you fancy a professor of pathology?

360
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:34,849
- Does he write poetry?
- Alas, no.

361
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,686
Then I'm afraid it's out
of the question. Excuse me.

362
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:53,283
- That's a marvelous girl, Zhivago.
- Yes, I'd noticed.

363
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:56,411
It's for you.

364
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:17,725
How'd the poet like to see
a bit of general practice?

365
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:25,358
Boris, thank God you've come.
This is very good of you.

366
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:28,278
- Yes, I know it is. My assistant.
- How do you do?

367
00:50:28,488 --> 00:50:31,031
- Come on, where is she?
- This way.

368
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:49,382
- When did she do it?
- About 8:00 this evening.

369
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:55,722
You know what it was?

370
00:51:01,271 --> 00:51:03,731
- Why didn't you get a local doctor?
- I couldn't.

371
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,692
No, I suppose you couldn't.
Come on, then.

372
00:51:08,236 --> 00:51:09,820
Let's turn her over.

373
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:16,491
Right.

374
00:51:18,828 --> 00:51:20,036
Water.

375
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:38,389
Right, Yuri. Come on, my dear, pick up.

376
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,683
Now, Yuri.

377
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:43,811
Come on, dear.

378
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:46,939
- Oh, come on, Yuri.
- Sorry.

379
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:51,694
Well, my dear. That's it.

380
00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:55,072
That's it. Good. Good.

381
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:57,575
Good.

382
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:06,334
Is she gonna live?

383
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:09,462
Water.

384
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:18,012
- She is, isn't she?
- Yes.

385
00:52:19,056 --> 00:52:23,268
Funny thing. There's a man,
speaks on public platforms.

386
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,606
In with the government, in with
the Liberals, in with everybody.

387
00:52:27,816 --> 00:52:30,943
And he risks it all. For that!

388
00:52:31,736 --> 00:52:36,280
That's not how poets see them, is it?
That's how GPs see them.

389
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:41,285
- That's how they are.
- You know, from here, she looks beautiful.

390
00:52:41,954 --> 00:52:44,163
Zhivago, I think you're a hard case.

391
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,752
Lara. Lara!

392
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:52,798
There's a child in the case, a child.
Her daughter.

393
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:55,175
Oh, for heaven's sake, Boris.

394
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:58,679
She might've thought about Lara
before she did it.

395
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:01,807
Does the girl know?
I'm afraid she does.

396
00:53:02,433 --> 00:53:03,642
- Is she here?
- Yes.

397
00:53:03,852 --> 00:53:07,436
Well, tell her that
her mother's going to live.

398
00:53:08,939 --> 00:53:13,275
- Wait a minute, Victor. Yuri.
- Yes, of course.

399
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:19,573
- What are we gonna say about this?
- Must we say anything?

400
00:53:19,782 --> 00:53:23,411
I'm afraid so. I'm taking her to the hospital.
We'll have to say something.

401
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:25,997
You know that needn't be difficult, Boris.

402
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:01,027
- What's the name of your assistant?
- Zhivago.

403
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:04,989
- Andreyevich?
- Yes, why? Do you know him?

404
00:56:05,198 --> 00:56:09,076
- No, I knew his father slightly.
- Right.

405
00:56:18,796 --> 00:56:22,674
Cheer up, Yuri. I'll have the poor bitch
in hospital tonight.

406
00:56:22,884 --> 00:56:24,509
What's his name?

407
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:28,055
That's Victor Komarovsky.
He says he knows you.

408
00:56:28,264 --> 00:56:30,807
He executed my father's will.

409
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:33,018
Uncle Alex turned it down.

410
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:37,897
Komarovsky said there wasn't much in it,
and what there was belonged to him.

411
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:42,569
He's a very good businessman.
But I doubt that he's crooked.

412
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,198
Very good company. Knows life.

413
00:56:46,407 --> 00:56:48,909
He's had a bad scare tonight.

414
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,720
You don't mind coming here,
do you, Victor?

415
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:13,308
No, no. It reminds me of my youth.

416
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,104
- I went to the hospital again.
- And?

417
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:22,149
She wants you to go and forgive her.
For her suspicions.

418
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:25,194
You can tell her the truth
if you like, Larissa.

419
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:34,203
- Is this him?
- Yes.

420
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,664
- He knows nothing about...
- No!

421
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:46,049
Pasha, this is Monsieur Komarovsky.

422
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:50,220
Please.

423
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:00,938
- Will you eat?
- No, thank you.

424
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:04,191
I hope you don't think
this is impertinent.

425
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:05,442
Not at all.

426
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:10,782
I have advised Larissa's mother for years.
I'm interested in what happens to her.

427
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,994
something I have to tell you
and that is this:

428
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:17,581
I am committed to the Revolution.

429
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:21,501
Nothing, not even Lara...

430
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:23,670
...has more importance for me.

431
00:58:25,548 --> 00:58:29,634
You misunderstand.
Your political views do not concern me.

432
00:58:29,802 --> 00:58:32,846
So far as that goes, I'm probably
more in sympathy than you suppose.

433
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:36,932
I have a few contacts of my own
which might surprise you.

434
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:40,270
- How do you propose to live?
- I've been offered a teaching post.

435
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:43,273
- May I know where?
- Gradov, it's in the Urals.

436
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:48,278
- I know it. Not much of a place.
- It's beautiful country, monsieur.

437
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:52,448
- Be a quiet life, won't it?
- That's what we want.

438
00:58:52,657 --> 00:58:55,951
Well, you'll excuse me:
Will your salary be adequate?

439
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:57,995
Adequate, not more.

440
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:04,043
Pavel Pavlovich,
my chief impression...

441
00:59:04,252 --> 00:59:07,631
...and I mean no offense,
is that you're very young.

442
00:59:08,174 --> 00:59:13,511
Monsieur, I hope I don't offend you.
Do people improve with age?

443
00:59:13,721 --> 00:59:17,723
- They grow a little more tolerant.
- To tolerate more in themselves.

444
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:21,018
If people don't marry young,
what do they bring to their marriage?

445
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:23,604
A little experience.

446
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:27,483
I'm 26. My mother died
needlessly when I was 8.

447
00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:31,070
My father died in prison.
I have fended for myself.

448
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:33,572
I've worked my way through school
and university.

449
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:37,202
I am familiar with things
that you can hardly guess at.

450
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:40,163
This is an experience
of a kind, certainly.

451
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:44,125
I've no amorous experience,
if that's what you mean. None whatever.

452
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:47,420
Lara's 17. That speaks for itself.

453
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:50,590
You probably find this situation comic.
We don't.

454
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,260
We're going to be married next year.

455
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:03,478
I hope I haven't offended you
by speaking plainly.

456
01:00:03,646 --> 01:00:05,355
Not at all. Admirable.

457
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:15,573
A young crusader.

458
01:00:16,075 --> 01:00:18,576
- He's...
- He's a very fine young man.

459
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:20,578
That's obvious.

460
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:23,707
You're very generous,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

461
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:28,920
Larissa, I want to talk to you.

462
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:40,181
Monsieur Komarovsky, have you...?

463
01:00:40,683 --> 01:00:45,478
I beg you, drop this affectation of
addressing me as "Monsieur Komarovsky. "

464
01:00:46,105 --> 01:00:49,356
Under the circumstances,
I find it rather ridiculous.

465
01:00:49,524 --> 01:00:53,485
Lara, I am determined to save you
from a dreadful error.

466
01:00:53,695 --> 01:00:57,531
There are two kinds of men, and only two.
That young man is one kind.

467
01:00:57,741 --> 01:01:00,326
He is high-minded. He is pure.

468
01:01:00,535 --> 01:01:04,831
He's the kind of man the world pretends
to look up to, and in fact despises.

469
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:09,961
He is the kind of man who breeds
unhappiness, particularly in women.

470
01:01:10,171 --> 01:01:11,463
- Do you understand?
- No.

471
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:13,340
I think you do.

472
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:15,425
There's another kind.

473
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:18,844
Not high-minded. Not pure. But alive.

474
01:01:19,637 --> 01:01:23,766
That your tastes should incline towards
the juvenile is understandable.

475
01:01:23,975 --> 01:01:26,977
But for you to marry that boy
would be a disaster.

476
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,605
Because there's two kinds of women.

477
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,862
There are two kinds of women. And you,
as we well know, are not the first kind.

478
01:01:39,492 --> 01:01:41,493
You, my dear...

479
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:43,787
...are a slut.

480
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:45,830
I am not!

481
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:48,792
We'll see.

482
01:02:33,213 --> 01:02:38,007
And don't delude yourself this was rape.
That would flatter us both.

483
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:25,763
- The master's not at home, Miss Lara.
- Not at home?

484
01:03:25,973 --> 01:03:29,309
No. He went to the
Sventytskis' Christmas party.

485
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:36,566
Are you going there, miss?
Please don't say I told you.

486
01:03:36,775 --> 01:03:40,778
- No. Thank you, Piotr!
- Merry Christmas, Miss Lara!

487
01:03:41,614 --> 01:03:44,324
Thank you and merry Christmas to you.

488
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,665
Merry Christmas, Yuri Andreyevich.

489
01:04:31,706 --> 01:04:33,749
Lara.

490
01:04:34,251 --> 01:04:35,834
What's the matter?

491
01:04:40,046 --> 01:04:42,506
We had an appointment this evening.
Where are you going?

492
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:47,094
- Haven't you read the letter? I left a letter.
- I've not been home. I'm going now.

493
01:04:49,222 --> 01:04:52,267
Where are you going, Lara?
I've a right to know.

494
01:04:52,476 --> 01:04:54,602
Lara, what's in this letter?

495
01:04:55,604 --> 01:04:57,522
What's in this letter?

496
01:04:58,566 --> 01:05:02,986
- Lara, are you breaking...?
- It's all in the letter.

497
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:05,446
- What is?
- Everything.

498
01:05:05,656 --> 01:05:07,115
Don't!

499
01:06:11,764 --> 01:06:14,849
Yuri, there's an extraordinary girl
at this party.

500
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:17,185
I know. I'm dancing with her.

501
01:06:19,564 --> 01:06:22,691
- You're keen tonight, Victor.
- I like to win.

502
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:27,613
Silence! Silence, everybody.
Silence, please.

503
01:06:28,114 --> 01:06:31,450
I have a very delightful
announcement to make.

504
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:37,287
- Oh, Madame Sventytski.
- Yes, why not?

505
01:06:37,455 --> 01:06:43,126
Aha! I have to announce that
Dr. Yuri Zhivago, yes, Dr. Zhivago...

506
01:06:43,336 --> 01:06:45,962
...he came third in all Moscow.

507
01:06:47,675 --> 01:06:49,759
Now, listen. Please, please.

508
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:52,428
Dr. Zhivago is betrothed
in marriage to...

509
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,079
My dear Victor!

510
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:20,206
My dear man.

511
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:23,042
- Get her out.
- What?

512
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:26,003
Get her out. Get her out!

513
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:29,424
- Yes, yes. I'll get the police.
- No!

514
01:07:29,842 --> 01:07:32,009
- Don't get the police.
Leave me!

515
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:34,971
I do not want the police.
Just get her out!

516
01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:55,617
Let her go.

517
01:08:19,893 --> 01:08:23,395
Please. Quiet, friends.
Please give way, yes?

518
01:08:23,646 --> 01:08:26,064
Please, would you mind?

519
01:08:26,733 --> 01:08:29,192
Would you mind? Thank you. Thank you.

520
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:45,249
- Our destinies seem to be interwoven.
- Yes.

521
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:50,755
- I was a close friend of your father.
- I knew you were his business partner.

522
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:54,634
Rather more than that.
I was present at his death.

523
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:59,013
Also, I'm in contact
with your brother.

524
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:00,556
Yevgraf?

525
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:05,770
I'm in contact with those in contact
with him. I disagree with Bolshevism.

526
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:07,355
Thank you.

527
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:10,316
You seem to know your trade.

528
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,821
But I can still
admire Bolsheviks as men.

529
01:09:15,532 --> 01:09:17,366
Shall I tell you why?

530
01:09:17,826 --> 01:09:19,242
Yes.

531
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:22,370
They may win.

532
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:29,460
I'd like to meet him. Yevgraf.
He sent me a marvelous letter.

533
01:09:30,504 --> 01:09:35,091
- He likes my poetry.
- That would've pleased your father.

534
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:39,638
Your father was not a bad man, Yuri.
If I may call you Yuri.

535
01:09:39,848 --> 01:09:41,557
I hardly knew him.

536
01:09:42,892 --> 01:09:45,519
You, perhaps, may not credit this...

537
01:09:46,563 --> 01:09:49,273
...but he was devoted to your mother.

538
01:10:02,786 --> 01:10:06,581
I suppose I may continue to rely
on your professional discretion?

539
01:10:10,295 --> 01:10:15,340
You mean, will I tell anyone
the truth about that girl?

540
01:10:15,592 --> 01:10:17,634
That's what I mean, yes.

541
01:10:19,387 --> 01:10:23,890
You may continue to rely
on my professional... et cetera.

542
01:10:24,099 --> 01:10:26,100
You are fastidious, aren't you?

543
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:32,023
What happens to a girl like that when
a man like you has finished with her?

544
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:36,319
Interested? I give her to you.

545
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:42,658
You shouldn't smoke.
You've had a shock.

546
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:52,043
I give her to you, Yuri Andreyevich.

547
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:54,754
A wedding present.

548
01:12:06,244 --> 01:12:07,828
Yuri?

549
01:12:08,037 --> 01:12:10,747
Where have you seen that girl before?

550
01:12:10,957 --> 01:12:14,418
- What makes you think I've seen her?
- Haven't you?

551
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:17,504
- Yes.
- Where?

552
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:20,840
I'm not supposed to say.
It was on a case. Her mother...

553
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:23,801
No, don't tell me
if you're not supposed to say.

554
01:13:03,676 --> 01:13:07,846
In bourgeois terms, it was
a war between the Allies and Germany.

555
01:13:08,056 --> 01:13:12,309
In Bolshevik terms, it was a war between
the Allied and German upper classes.

556
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:16,271
And which of them won
was a matter of indifference.

557
01:13:33,331 --> 01:13:38,210
I was ordered by the Party to enlist.
I gave my name as Petrov.

558
01:13:38,669 --> 01:13:41,296
They were shouting for victory
all over Europe...

559
01:13:41,506 --> 01:13:44,549
...praying for victory,
to the same God.

560
01:13:44,759 --> 01:13:49,846
My task, the Party's task,
was to organize defeat.

561
01:13:50,098 --> 01:13:52,516
From defeat would
spring the Revolution.

562
01:13:52,725 --> 01:13:55,519
And the Revolution would be
victory for us.

563
01:13:56,354 --> 01:13:58,940
The Party looked
to the conscript peasants.

564
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:02,526
Most of them wearing
their first good pair of boots.

565
01:14:02,735 --> 01:14:05,987
When the boots wore out,
they'd be ready to listen.

566
01:14:06,197 --> 01:14:10,158
When the time came, I took three battalions
with me out of the front line.

567
01:14:10,368 --> 01:14:12,494
The best day's work I ever did.

568
01:14:12,953 --> 01:14:15,621
But for the moment,
there was nothing to be done.

569
01:14:15,789 --> 01:14:21,001
There were too many volunteers,
like me. Mostly it was mere hysteria.

570
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:25,214
But there were men with better motives,
men who saw that times were critical...

571
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:29,386
...and wanted a man's part.
Good men, wasted.

572
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:34,182
Unhappy men too.
Unhappy in their jobs.

573
01:14:34,475 --> 01:14:36,768
Unhappy with their wives.

574
01:14:37,061 --> 01:14:39,396
Doubting themselves.

575
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:42,106
Happy men don't volunteer.

576
01:14:42,315 --> 01:14:47,278
They wait their turn and thank God
if their age or work delays it.

577
01:14:47,487 --> 01:14:52,575
The ones who got back home at the
price of an arm or an eye or a leg...

578
01:14:52,784 --> 01:14:54,785
...these were the lucky ones.

579
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:03,170
Even Comrade Lenin underestimated...

580
01:15:03,379 --> 01:15:06,923
...both the anguish
of that 900-mile-long front...

581
01:15:07,425 --> 01:15:10,677
...and our cursed capacity
for suffering.

582
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:15,891
By the second winter of the war...

583
01:15:16,142 --> 01:15:18,810
...the boots had worn out...

584
01:15:19,478 --> 01:15:21,937
...but the line still held.

585
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:25,901
Their greatcoats fell
to pieces on their backs.

586
01:15:26,277 --> 01:15:28,945
Their rations were irregular.

587
01:15:29,155 --> 01:15:33,950
Half of them went into action without
arms, led by men they didn't trust.

588
01:15:34,493 --> 01:15:36,161
Come on, you bastards!

589
01:15:38,164 --> 01:15:39,831
And those they did trust...

590
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:42,375
Come on, comrades, come on!

591
01:15:42,877 --> 01:15:44,252
Come on!

592
01:15:46,297 --> 01:15:48,006
Come on!

593
01:15:53,889 --> 01:15:55,473
Come on!

594
01:15:59,645 --> 01:16:04,272
Comrades! Earthshakers! Show them!

595
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:10,194
Charge them!

596
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:35,136
At last, they did what
all the armies dreamed of doing.

597
01:16:35,638 --> 01:16:37,847
They began to go home.

598
01:16:48,149 --> 01:16:51,403
That was the beginning
of the Revolution.

599
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:17,262
Deserters.

600
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:19,556
Replacements.

601
01:17:31,986 --> 01:17:33,695
Tote...

602
01:17:34,613 --> 01:17:36,031
...arms!

603
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:44,998
Come back!

604
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:47,542
Stick together!

605
01:17:50,339 --> 01:17:53,132
Stick together and we'll be all right.

606
01:17:54,009 --> 01:17:55,634
And be ready for them.

607
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:23,953
Turn round, lads.
Don't go any further.

608
01:18:24,163 --> 01:18:27,540
Come on, turn around.
Pigs for the slaughter.

609
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:29,793
Turn round, lads!

610
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:38,051
Don't listen to them.
Get back in your ranks, I say!

611
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:41,178
Don't pay any attention
to those cowards!

612
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:45,682
No more war! No more war!

613
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:56,319
Listen, lads. Ten miles
up that road are the Germans!

614
01:18:57,863 --> 01:19:00,782
- Rubbish!
- It's not rubbish. They're coming.

615
01:19:01,534 --> 01:19:03,576
And they're coming fast.

616
01:19:03,786 --> 01:19:05,912
You've let them in!

617
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:11,084
They're coming for your wives,
your houses...

618
01:19:11,502 --> 01:19:14,629
...your country.
- Your country, officer!

619
01:19:15,549 --> 01:19:18,634
Yes, my country! And proud...

620
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:36,151
Get back in your ranks!

621
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,237
Get back in your ranks, I say!

622
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:45,119
Get back!

623
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:49,999
Get back in ranks!

624
01:21:06,283 --> 01:21:09,160
- Are you a nurse?
- Yes.

625
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:11,539
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

626
01:21:11,748 --> 01:21:13,332
Then help me.

627
01:21:41,486 --> 01:21:44,488
I ought to tell you,
I'm not a trained nurse, I'm a volunteer.

628
01:21:44,698 --> 01:21:48,784
I see, right. Why did you volunteer?

629
01:21:49,202 --> 01:21:52,413
- I came here to find my husband.
- Very gently.

630
01:21:52,622 --> 01:21:55,164
- Have you ever seen an operation?
- Yes.

631
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:56,708
We'll manage.

632
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:13,391
They're in the next village,
brothers! The Germans.

633
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:15,685
- Your Honor...
- Keep still.

634
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:47,592
Did you find your husband?

635
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:49,886
No.

636
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:53,640
- Your Honor...
- Yes, we'd better be off.

637
01:23:09,532 --> 01:23:12,451
You know, you often look at me
as though you knew me.

638
01:23:12,661 --> 01:23:16,747
I have seen you.
Four years ago, Christmas Eve.

639
01:23:18,208 --> 01:23:19,667
Were you there?

640
01:23:20,669 --> 01:23:22,794
No wonder you look at me.

641
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:28,174
- Did you know Victor Komarovsky?
- Yes, I did.

642
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:31,219
- That young man who took you away...
- My husband.

643
01:23:31,428 --> 01:23:34,306
A lot of courage.
He made the rest of us look very feeble.

644
01:23:34,516 --> 01:23:39,478
As a matter of fact, I thought
you both did. Good man to shoot at.

645
01:23:40,355 --> 01:23:43,232
I'd give anything
never to have met him.

646
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:14,929
The Tsar's in prison.

647
01:24:16,724 --> 01:24:18,683
Lenin's in Moscow!

648
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:22,437
- Civil war has started.
- Good!

649
01:24:22,646 --> 01:24:24,981
Civil war, good?

650
01:24:25,232 --> 01:24:28,067
Not good, Comrade Nurse. Inevitable.

651
01:24:28,986 --> 01:24:31,905
But Lenin in Moscow!

652
01:24:32,824 --> 01:24:36,493
This Lenin, will he be
the new Tsar then?

653
01:24:37,495 --> 01:24:40,873
Listen, Daddy, no more Tsars,
no more masters!

654
01:24:41,082 --> 01:24:44,542
Only workers in a workers' state!
How about that?

655
01:24:45,878 --> 01:24:47,837
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes.

656
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:49,756
Follow me, please.

657
01:25:36,095 --> 01:25:38,430
I can't deal with this.

658
01:25:38,681 --> 01:25:42,309
Order of the Provisional Government.
You'll have to try, friend.

659
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:52,819
"If you could see how hard
we've been working here...

660
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:55,947
...I'm sure you'd forgive me
for not writing more regularly. "

661
01:25:56,156 --> 01:25:58,992
- When was that written?
- July 20th.

662
01:25:59,202 --> 01:26:00,744
Eight weeks!

663
01:26:00,954 --> 01:26:03,538
"But now the war seems really
to have stopped.

664
01:26:03,747 --> 01:26:07,041
The hospital is emptying,
and I shall have more time.

665
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:11,921
I may even get time to write some verse,
if I've not forgotten how to. "

666
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:13,798
Oh, I do hope so.

667
01:26:15,759 --> 01:26:20,471
"Larissa Antipova is still here,
and I admire her more and more.

668
01:26:21,139 --> 01:26:25,476
She has that strange gift of healing,
which doctors don't believe in.

669
01:26:26,103 --> 01:26:30,691
She often does the wrong things,
but it always seems to work out right.

670
01:26:31,734 --> 01:26:34,862
How is Uncle Alex?
Can he still get his English tobacco?"

671
01:26:35,071 --> 01:26:36,613
Would that he could.

672
01:26:36,823 --> 01:26:40,534
"Can Sasha say his letters yet?
And how is Auntie Anna?"

673
01:26:41,619 --> 01:26:43,411
He didn't get my letter.

674
01:26:44,705 --> 01:26:47,540
"Most of all, my dearest,
how are you?"

675
01:26:47,749 --> 01:26:51,127
Strangely upsetting,
he doesn't know she's dead.

676
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:53,546
Can't see what difference it makes.

677
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:57,175
They're at it again!

678
01:26:57,385 --> 01:27:00,304
I wish they'd decide
once and for all...

679
01:27:00,513 --> 01:27:05,767
...which gang of hooligans constitutes
the government of this country!

680
01:27:12,066 --> 01:27:14,067
Cheer up, Sergei.

681
01:27:14,444 --> 01:27:16,361
Don't you want to go home?

682
01:27:16,863 --> 01:27:20,490
There's fighting at home, Your Honor.
I've had enough.

683
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:25,120
Red Guards and White Guards...
The old man's had enough.

684
01:27:25,914 --> 01:27:28,248
Your Honor is a kind gentleman.

685
01:27:30,752 --> 01:27:33,045
And the nurse is a kind lady!

686
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:50,978
- Finished?
- Just about.

687
01:27:59,614 --> 01:28:04,325
- In a while, you'll be with your little girl.
- If I can get on a train.

688
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:10,414
I want to be with Katya
more than anything in the world.

689
01:28:10,624 --> 01:28:12,041
Yes, of course.

690
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:16,003
But now that we're going, I feel sad.

691
01:28:17,839 --> 01:28:20,883
Sad. Really sad.

692
01:28:21,927 --> 01:28:24,137
Well, we've been here some time.

693
01:28:26,808 --> 01:28:31,228
This must have been a lovely
house once. Don't you think?

694
01:28:31,437 --> 01:28:33,230
What are you going to do?

695
01:28:33,982 --> 01:28:35,691
- In Gradov?
- Yes.

696
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,612
- I'll be all right.
- I wish I could think so.

697
01:28:46,076 --> 01:28:48,119
You could run a laundry.

698
01:28:49,413 --> 01:28:50,872
What will you do?

699
01:28:51,082 --> 01:28:53,542
I suppose I'll go back
to the hospital.

700
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,878
It's funny to think of you there.

701
01:29:00,425 --> 01:29:03,135
I used to pass it on my way to school.

702
01:29:04,053 --> 01:29:07,723
- Do you ever come to Moscow?
- From Gradov?

703
01:29:08,266 --> 01:29:11,018
If only there were someone
to look after you.

704
01:29:11,227 --> 01:29:14,438
Of course, if there were,
I'd be destroyed by jealousy.

705
01:29:14,647 --> 01:29:16,690
Zhivago, don't.

706
01:29:19,862 --> 01:29:21,487
My dear...

707
01:29:21,739 --> 01:29:23,781
Don't, please.

708
01:29:28,786 --> 01:29:31,288
Now, look what you've made me do.

709
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:40,546
Yuri, we've been
together six months...

710
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:42,590
...on the road and here.

711
01:29:42,799 --> 01:29:46,510
We've not done anything
you'll have to lie about to Tonya.

712
01:29:47,846 --> 01:29:50,307
I don't want you to have
to lie about me.

713
01:29:51,768 --> 01:29:53,810
You understand that, Yuri?

714
01:29:56,773 --> 01:29:59,024
You understand everything.

715
01:30:08,784 --> 01:30:11,368
Come on, comrades! I'm in a hurry!

716
01:30:11,578 --> 01:30:13,079
Going home, Kirill?

717
01:30:13,288 --> 01:30:17,459
Home, Your Excellency? Petrograd.
I'm joining the Red Guard.

718
01:30:17,668 --> 01:30:19,753
What about your wife?

719
01:30:19,962 --> 01:30:23,256
Sometimes, Comrade Nurse,
women have to wait.

720
01:30:23,466 --> 01:30:26,760
Right. Goodbye, honored doctor.

721
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:28,804
Want some advice?

722
01:30:29,013 --> 01:30:33,850
- Said the millstone to the barley.
- That's right. Adapt yourself.

723
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:44,485
- Goodbye, Ivanov.
- Goodbye, Your Honor.

724
01:30:45,821 --> 01:30:47,614
Goodbye, Andre.

725
01:30:48,407 --> 01:30:50,200
Goodbye, Simeon.

726
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:57,415
I'll never forget Your Honor. Never.

727
01:30:58,751 --> 01:31:00,544
Goodbye, Zhivago.

728
01:31:02,046 --> 01:31:04,297
Goodbye. Thank you.

729
01:31:06,926 --> 01:31:08,009
Pilenko.

730
01:31:35,412 --> 01:31:36,829
Giddap!

731
01:31:46,632 --> 01:31:50,218
- Goodbye, brothers!
Goodbye!

732
01:32:34,263 --> 01:32:36,514
The doctor is a gentleman.

733
01:32:36,724 --> 01:32:40,018
- Right. Written all over him.
- He's a good man.

734
01:32:40,311 --> 01:32:42,521
God rot good men.

735
01:32:58,829 --> 01:33:00,455
Yuri!

736
01:33:29,526 --> 01:33:30,943
Yuri.

737
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:35,906
This is Comrade Yelkin,
our local delegate. He lives here.

738
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:38,575
How do you do?

739
01:33:39,287 --> 01:33:40,662
Welcome.

740
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:43,665
- Comrade Kaprugina.
- Welcome.

741
01:33:43,874 --> 01:33:46,042
It's not for you to welcome us, comrade.

742
01:33:46,252 --> 01:33:50,547
Comrade Kaprugina is the Chairman
of the Residents' Committee.

743
01:33:50,756 --> 01:33:53,383
- Yes, of course.
- Your discharge papers?

744
01:33:53,551 --> 01:33:55,260
Oh, yes.

745
01:33:56,304 --> 01:33:58,638
I signed them myself, I'm afraid.

746
01:34:04,312 --> 01:34:06,854
Holy Cross? What?

747
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:11,318
- Holy Cross Hospital, it's on...
- The Second Reformed Hospital.

748
01:34:13,696 --> 01:34:15,905
Good. It needed reforming.

749
01:34:21,412 --> 01:34:24,497
Medicals report
to their place of work at once.

750
01:34:24,707 --> 01:34:26,958
Yes, I believe there's typhus.

751
01:34:28,461 --> 01:34:33,715
You've been listening to rumormongers.
There is no typhus in our city.

752
01:34:33,924 --> 01:34:37,428
Well, that's good news.
I'll report tomorrow.

753
01:34:37,637 --> 01:34:41,015
When you've started work,
you'll get a ration book.

754
01:34:41,224 --> 01:34:43,225
I've always worked.

755
01:34:48,522 --> 01:34:51,775
- Whatever is the matter?
- You are.

756
01:34:54,362 --> 01:34:59,491
There was living space
for 13 families in this one house.

757
01:35:00,868 --> 01:35:01,993
Yes.

758
01:35:02,203 --> 01:35:07,208
Yes, this is a better arrangement,
comrades. More just.

759
01:35:14,758 --> 01:35:18,469
But it is more just.
Why did it sound so funny?

760
01:35:28,478 --> 01:35:30,562
Is it good to be home?

761
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,659
- Sasha?
- Who else?

762
01:35:44,995 --> 01:35:48,081
This is your daddy, Sasha.
- Sasha.

763
01:35:49,375 --> 01:35:50,792
Sasha!

764
01:35:52,128 --> 01:35:55,380
- Naughty boy!
- No, don't say that.

765
01:35:56,507 --> 01:35:58,299
May I come in?

766
01:36:00,594 --> 01:36:02,262
Watch carefully.

767
01:36:02,931 --> 01:36:07,892
I'm about to ignite the last half
of the last cigar in Moscow.

768
01:36:09,645 --> 01:36:11,396
- Good meal?
- Very.

769
01:36:11,605 --> 01:36:13,106
Say something.

770
01:36:15,151 --> 01:36:17,986
- That was very good, Tonya.
- That was nothing.

771
01:36:18,195 --> 01:36:20,572
She saved that salami
for three months.

772
01:36:20,781 --> 01:36:23,533
- Have you, darling?
- I got it for a clock.

773
01:36:23,909 --> 01:36:26,911
She's a marvel. Coffee, you observe.

774
01:36:27,121 --> 01:36:30,623
Stop it, Daddy.
He knows I'm a marvel.

775
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:34,295
- Did you write any poetry?
- Quite a lot.

776
01:36:34,504 --> 01:36:36,255
Is it good?

777
01:36:36,882 --> 01:36:39,383
Yes. I think so.

778
01:36:39,634 --> 01:36:42,636
- Can I see it?
- But of course.

779
01:36:44,848 --> 01:36:49,392
What happened to Nurse Antipova?
Your letters were full of her.

780
01:36:49,643 --> 01:36:51,686
Yes, I suppose they were.

781
01:36:52,396 --> 01:36:55,523
The girl who shot
friend Komarovsky, isn't it?

782
01:36:55,733 --> 01:36:57,609
Yes, Daddy. You know it is.

783
01:36:57,818 --> 01:37:00,821
She's gone home to her little girl.

784
01:37:01,031 --> 01:37:03,574
- Oh, we shan't see her then?
- No.

785
01:37:03,783 --> 01:37:05,451
What a pity.

786
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,711
Farewell, the pleasures of the flesh.

787
01:37:17,755 --> 01:37:22,133
What I don't understand is how
we're going to stay alive this winter.

788
01:37:26,513 --> 01:37:29,014
You have no right whatever
to call me from work.

789
01:37:29,225 --> 01:37:32,977
- As a Soviet Deputy, I...
- That gives you the power, not the right.

790
01:37:33,229 --> 01:37:36,397
It's noticed, you know.
Your attitude is noticed.

791
01:37:36,607 --> 01:37:39,317
You should have called
the area doctor.

792
01:37:39,527 --> 01:37:41,444
I want this done quietly.

793
01:37:41,904 --> 01:37:43,988
Why, what is it? Typhus?

794
01:37:54,083 --> 01:37:57,085
I'll take him away.
Get me some transport.

795
01:37:57,336 --> 01:37:59,255
It isn't typhus.

796
01:37:59,464 --> 01:38:03,092
It's another disease we don't have
in Moscow: starvation.

797
01:38:03,301 --> 01:38:07,387
- That seems to give you satisfaction.
- It would satisfy me to hear you admit it.

798
01:38:07,596 --> 01:38:10,056
- Would it? Why?
- Because it is so.

799
01:38:11,392 --> 01:38:15,687
Your attitude is noticed, you know.
Oh, yes, it's been noticed.

800
01:38:18,816 --> 01:38:20,942
- Yuri!
- Hello.

801
01:38:25,322 --> 01:38:27,199
The stove's out.

802
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:33,247
Tonya, the stove's out.

803
01:38:33,790 --> 01:38:37,209
What's the matter with you?
No wonder he's losing weight.

804
01:38:45,176 --> 01:38:50,597
She lets it out as soon as you're gone
and she lights it before you come home.

805
01:39:03,236 --> 01:39:05,362
We haven't enough fuel.

806
01:39:24,048 --> 01:39:26,675
I told myself it was beneath my dignity...

807
01:39:26,884 --> 01:39:29,344
...to arrest a man
for pilfering firewood.

808
01:39:32,348 --> 01:39:35,183
But nothing ordered by the Party
is beneath dignity...

809
01:39:35,392 --> 01:39:36,851
...and the Party was right.

810
01:39:37,061 --> 01:39:40,396
One man desperate
for a bit of fuel is pathetic.

811
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:44,233
Five million people desperate for fuel
will destroy a city.

812
01:39:45,235 --> 01:39:49,739
That was the first time I ever saw
my brother. But I knew him.

813
01:39:49,948 --> 01:39:52,993
And I knew that I would
disobey the Party.

814
01:39:53,203 --> 01:39:56,705
Perhaps it was the tie of blood
between us, but I doubt it.

815
01:39:56,915 --> 01:40:00,417
We were only half-tied anyway.
And brothers will betray a brother.

816
01:40:00,835 --> 01:40:02,378
As a policeman, I would say:

817
01:40:02,587 --> 01:40:06,090
"Get hold of a man's brother,
and you're halfway home. "

818
01:40:06,299 --> 01:40:09,884
Nor was it admiration
for a better man than me.

819
01:40:10,094 --> 01:40:14,180
I did admire him, but I didn't
think he was a better man.

820
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:18,726
Besides, I've executed better men
than me with a small pistol.

821
01:40:50,008 --> 01:40:53,095
You'll have to live like
the rest of us, doctor.

822
01:40:53,304 --> 01:40:55,431
Bring it back! Bring that back!

823
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:57,933
Oh, listen to His Excellency.

824
01:40:59,894 --> 01:41:04,189
I want no anarchy!
I want this carried out correctly.

825
01:41:07,651 --> 01:41:10,737
- What are you doing?
- Reallocation of living space.

826
01:41:10,946 --> 01:41:13,865
Fifty square meters per family
of less than five.

827
01:41:14,074 --> 01:41:17,618
- Damn it, whose house is this anyway?
- Father, be quiet!

828
01:41:17,828 --> 01:41:21,248
All right, 50 square meters!
What're you doing with my things?

829
01:41:21,458 --> 01:41:24,376
- They're being stored.
- They're being stolen.

830
01:41:24,544 --> 01:41:27,129
Yuri!
- Just a minute!

831
01:41:36,472 --> 01:41:40,224
- And where did you get this?
- I pulled it out of a fence.

832
01:42:08,295 --> 01:42:10,630
I told them who I was.

833
01:42:10,839 --> 01:42:15,468
The old man was hostile.
The girl, cautious.

834
01:42:15,677 --> 01:42:17,179
My brother...

835
01:42:18,807 --> 01:42:20,933
...seemed very pleased.

836
01:42:24,145 --> 01:42:28,232
I think the girl was the only one
who guessed at their position.

837
01:42:29,567 --> 01:42:32,903
You're just as I imagined you:
you're my political conscience.

838
01:42:33,112 --> 01:42:37,616
I asked him, hadn't he one of his own?
And so he talked about the Revolution.

839
01:42:37,826 --> 01:42:42,329
You lay life on a table, and you cut out
all the tumors of injustice. Marvelous.

840
01:42:42,539 --> 01:42:46,000
I told him if he felt like that,
he should join the Party.

841
01:42:46,210 --> 01:42:49,711
But cutting out the tumors of injustice,
that's a deep operation.

842
01:42:49,921 --> 01:42:55,092
Someone must keep life alive while you
do it, by living. Isnt that right?

843
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:57,553
I thought, then, it was wrong.

844
01:42:58,054 --> 01:43:01,889
He told me what he thought
about the Party and I trembled for him.

845
01:43:02,099 --> 01:43:06,853
He approved of us, but for reasons
which were subtle, like his verse.

846
01:43:07,062 --> 01:43:10,815
Approval such as his could
vanish overnight. I told him so.

847
01:43:11,024 --> 01:43:14,402
Well, I can't approve this evening
something you may do tomorrow.

848
01:43:14,612 --> 01:43:18,574
He was walking about with a noose
round his neck and didn't know.

849
01:43:18,992 --> 01:43:22,661
So I told him what
I had heard about his poems.

850
01:43:24,914 --> 01:43:26,832
Not liked?

851
01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:29,333
Not liked by whom?

852
01:43:30,252 --> 01:43:31,460
Why not liked?

853
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:34,130
So I told him that.

854
01:43:42,723 --> 01:43:46,602
Do you think it's "personal,
petit-bourgeois and self-indulgent"?

855
01:43:47,478 --> 01:43:48,854
I lied.

856
01:43:49,981 --> 01:43:51,648
But he believed me.

857
01:43:52,108 --> 01:43:55,819
It struck me through
to see that my opinion mattered.

858
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,781
The girl knew what it meant,
what it was going to mean.

859
01:43:59,991 --> 01:44:03,118
They couldn't survive
what was coming in the city.

860
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:06,413
I urged them to leave and live
obscurely in the country...

861
01:44:06,623 --> 01:44:08,623
...where they could
keep themselves alive.

862
01:44:08,832 --> 01:44:13,128
We have... Used to have an estate
at Varykino near Yuryatin.

863
01:44:15,173 --> 01:44:16,965
People know us there.

864
01:44:17,175 --> 01:44:21,929
He didn't resist. I offered
to obtain permits, passes, warrants.

865
01:44:22,138 --> 01:44:25,057
Told them what to take
and what to leave behind.

866
01:44:28,811 --> 01:44:32,940
I had the impertinence to ask him
for a volume of his poems.

867
01:44:33,566 --> 01:44:35,275
And so we parted.

868
01:44:35,485 --> 01:44:39,029
I think I even told him that we would
meet again in better times.

869
01:44:39,697 --> 01:44:41,699
But perhaps I didn't.

870
01:46:40,027 --> 01:46:43,488
Fifty persons! Fifty persons only!

871
01:46:45,449 --> 01:46:48,076
- Tonya!
- Yes!

872
01:46:48,243 --> 01:46:49,451
Tonya! Here!

873
01:46:49,619 --> 01:46:53,913
Fifty persons only! Get back!

874
01:46:55,791 --> 01:47:00,294
Fifty persons only! Fifty persons only!

875
01:47:00,962 --> 01:47:05,509
Fifty persons! Only 50 persons!

876
01:47:17,855 --> 01:47:19,606
Charming accommodation.

877
01:47:19,816 --> 01:47:23,693
"Charming accommodation. "
That's very good.

878
01:47:23,903 --> 01:47:25,570
I'm an intellectual.

879
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:28,949
Shut up, you "intellectual. "

880
01:47:30,283 --> 01:47:32,493
Shut up, you lickspittle.

881
01:47:39,377 --> 01:47:40,836
Forced labor.

882
01:47:51,305 --> 01:47:55,308
Attention, comrades, your train
will leave tomorrow morning.

883
01:47:55,518 --> 01:47:57,936
"Health regulations for the journey:

884
01:47:58,146 --> 01:48:00,689
Night soil will be emptied
every morning without fail.

885
01:48:00,898 --> 01:48:04,986
Straw to be replaced at 10-day
intervals, the old straw burned.

886
01:48:05,195 --> 01:48:08,990
If fresh straw is unavailable,
old straw will be turned. "

887
01:48:09,615 --> 01:48:12,325
This is disinfectant. Use it.

888
01:48:13,744 --> 01:48:16,913
- "This wagon is a unit of Voluntary Labor. "
- Liar.

889
01:48:22,086 --> 01:48:25,547
"You're required by the
Military Committee to assist them.

890
01:48:25,756 --> 01:48:30,468
One carriage is occupied by sailors of
the heroic Kronstadt Sailors' Soviet. "

891
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:35,266
- So you'll be in good hands.
- They're idiots.

892
01:48:36,185 --> 01:48:41,522
"Attention. In approximately 11 days' time,
you'll pass through the Urals Province...

893
01:48:41,690 --> 01:48:44,942
...where White Guard units,
aided by foreign interventionists...

894
01:48:45,152 --> 01:48:48,862
...and other criminal reactionary elements
have recently been active.

895
01:48:49,238 --> 01:48:51,238
The Military Committee assures you...

896
01:48:51,448 --> 01:48:55,910
...the criminals have been routed
in that area by Red Guard units...

897
01:48:56,119 --> 01:48:59,455
...under the command of
People's Commander Strelnikov. "

898
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:03,835
There's a man. Clap him.

899
01:49:05,254 --> 01:49:09,466
"The line is definitely clear.
Long live the Revolution. "

900
01:49:09,717 --> 01:49:12,636
Long live anarchy! Lickspittle!

901
01:49:12,845 --> 01:49:14,679
Bureaucrat!

902
01:49:23,397 --> 01:49:24,773
Is that necessary?

903
01:49:25,942 --> 01:49:30,528
Six volunteers I've signed for,
and six I'll deliver.

904
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:34,282
I'm a free man, lickspittle.

905
01:49:34,492 --> 01:49:37,202
There's nothing you can do about it.

906
01:49:42,917 --> 01:49:46,169
I'm the only free man on this train.

907
01:49:46,796 --> 01:49:49,297
The rest of you are cattle!

908
01:55:01,235 --> 01:55:03,528
Help me, brothers, for the love of God!

909
01:55:19,629 --> 01:55:20,796
Come on!

910
01:55:40,774 --> 01:55:43,611
Yuri, the child is dead.

911
01:55:52,370 --> 01:55:57,791
It wasn't my child, dear,
and his little soul's in heaven now.

912
01:55:59,127 --> 01:56:03,213
- Who did it, comrade, the Whites?
- The Whites?

913
01:56:05,175 --> 01:56:07,801
No. Strelnikov.

914
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:11,804
Well, then, you must have
done something.

915
01:56:12,015 --> 01:56:16,435
It wasn't us. The commander said
we'd sold horses to the Whites.

916
01:56:16,645 --> 01:56:20,898
It wasn't us. It was those pigs in Kuniko.
We told him, but he didn't believe us.

917
01:56:21,107 --> 01:56:23,734
- I expect you were lying.
- As God's my witness...

918
01:56:23,943 --> 01:56:25,527
But he isn't.

919
01:56:27,029 --> 01:56:29,697
Commander Strelnikov is a great man.

920
01:56:30,949 --> 01:56:34,786
A commander, Sasha,
and he lives on bread and water.

921
01:56:34,995 --> 01:56:38,331
- Does he?
- I don't know. They say so.

922
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:42,127
It's true. No one knows
where he comes from.

923
01:56:42,337 --> 01:56:45,964
- And they never know where he is.
- He's back up the line.

924
01:56:46,174 --> 01:56:47,424
Yes?

925
01:56:48,134 --> 01:56:52,053
Now, someone's for it, eh?

926
01:56:53,555 --> 01:56:56,182
Oh, really! Not again.

927
01:56:56,892 --> 01:56:58,476
What this time?

928
01:57:08,404 --> 01:57:11,824
Never mind, Father.
Get a good night's sleep.

929
01:57:16,121 --> 01:57:17,955
I know what I'm going to do.

930
01:57:40,979 --> 01:57:42,479
Look!

931
01:57:43,106 --> 01:57:44,690
The Urals.

932
01:57:46,234 --> 01:57:49,278
Look, Sasha, look!
That's where we're going, darling.

933
01:57:49,446 --> 01:57:52,072
Through the mountains
and into the forest.

934
01:57:52,323 --> 01:57:54,658
Then keeping much warmer still.

935
01:57:55,618 --> 01:57:58,746
Will there be wolves in the forest?

936
01:58:22,978 --> 01:58:24,771
Strelnikov!

937
01:58:30,527 --> 01:58:32,028
Yes.

938
01:58:32,488 --> 01:58:34,280
That's Strelnikov.

939
02:03:30,212 --> 02:03:31,629
Daddy?

940
02:03:34,216 --> 02:03:36,634
What's that noise?

941
02:03:37,094 --> 02:03:38,761
It's only a waterfall.

942
02:03:39,013 --> 02:03:41,640
No, the other noise.

943
02:03:44,603 --> 02:03:46,645
Guns, Sasha.

944
02:03:46,855 --> 02:03:49,773
- Are they fighting?
- They must be.

945
02:03:49,983 --> 02:03:51,692
It's a long way away.

946
02:03:51,943 --> 02:03:53,737
Let's go to sleep.

947
02:04:44,208 --> 02:04:45,249
Get him!

948
02:04:45,501 --> 02:04:46,584
No!

949
02:04:51,299 --> 02:04:52,341
Look.

950
02:05:00,517 --> 02:05:02,686
- Is that all?
That's all.

951
02:05:11,487 --> 02:05:12,529
Bring him.

952
02:05:25,336 --> 02:05:26,837
Who sent you here, Zhivago?

953
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:29,881
No one sent me here,
commander.

954
02:05:30,091 --> 02:05:33,677
I'm with my wife and child.
They're on the train from Moscow.

955
02:05:33,928 --> 02:05:36,763
- Yes, we've checked that.
- Then?

956
02:05:36,973 --> 02:05:40,517
You put your knife with a fork
and a spoon and it looks innocuous.

957
02:05:40,768 --> 02:05:44,689
Perhaps you travel with a wife
and child for the same reason.

958
02:05:46,442 --> 02:05:47,650
No!

959
02:05:47,861 --> 02:05:51,697
Yuryatin is occupied by White Guards.
Is that why you're going there?

960
02:05:52,198 --> 02:05:55,034
No, we're going on to Varykino.

961
02:05:55,243 --> 02:05:57,661
Not through Yuryatin.
It's under shellfire.

962
02:05:58,288 --> 02:06:01,165
Commander, I'm not a White Agent.

963
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,792
No, I don't think you are.

964
02:06:04,044 --> 02:06:06,795
All right, Kolya. Thank you, comrade.
Sit down, doctor.

965
02:06:07,047 --> 02:06:08,589
Take it.

966
02:06:09,716 --> 02:06:13,886
It's not as silly as it seems.
There have been one or two attempts.

967
02:06:19,018 --> 02:06:20,977
Are you the poet?

968
02:06:21,312 --> 02:06:22,437
Yes.

969
02:06:22,688 --> 02:06:25,691
- I used to admire your poetry.
- Thank you.

970
02:06:25,942 --> 02:06:27,276
I shouldn't admire it now.

971
02:06:28,111 --> 02:06:31,822
I should find it absurdly personal,
don't you agree?

972
02:06:32,074 --> 02:06:36,285
Feelings, insights, affections.
It's suddenly trivial now.

973
02:06:37,162 --> 02:06:39,330
You don't agree. You're wrong.

974
02:06:39,539 --> 02:06:44,001
The personal life is dead in Russia.
History has killed it.

975
02:06:45,714 --> 02:06:48,299
I can see how you might hate me.

976
02:06:49,343 --> 02:06:53,179
I hate everything you say,
but not enough to kill you for it.

977
02:06:55,474 --> 02:06:56,849
You have a brother.

978
02:06:57,101 --> 02:07:00,019
- Yevgraf?
- Yevgraf, yes. The policeman.

979
02:07:00,354 --> 02:07:03,731
- I didn't know that.
- Perhaps not. A secret policeman.

980
02:07:03,941 --> 02:07:06,235
- Did he send you here?
- Yevgraf?

981
02:07:06,444 --> 02:07:08,320
No, Yevgraf's a Bolshevik.

982
02:07:12,659 --> 02:07:15,620
I don't know anything
about these things.

983
02:07:15,830 --> 02:07:18,414
Oh, you know a great deal.

984
02:07:18,666 --> 02:07:21,751
When you came in,
you recognized me. How?

985
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:25,380
- Has someone shown you photographs?
- No.

986
02:07:25,966 --> 02:07:28,384
I am certain that you recognized me.

987
02:07:30,804 --> 02:07:32,388
I've seen you before.

988
02:07:33,807 --> 02:07:34,890
When?

989
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:37,810
- Six years ago.
- Go on.

990
02:07:38,728 --> 02:07:40,271
Christmas Eve, you...

991
02:07:41,606 --> 02:07:43,150
You were there?

992
02:07:43,484 --> 02:07:45,068
Or has someone told you this?

993
02:07:46,028 --> 02:07:48,781
I attended to the man who was injured
by your wife.

994
02:07:50,033 --> 02:07:51,617
Why do you call her my wife?

995
02:07:53,203 --> 02:07:57,539
I met her again. We served together
on the Ukrainian front.

996
02:07:57,790 --> 02:07:59,708
I'm sure she'd vouch for me.

997
02:08:00,918 --> 02:08:03,378
I haven't seen her since the war.

998
02:08:04,172 --> 02:08:05,255
She's in Yuryatin.

999
02:08:08,677 --> 02:08:09,969
Yuryatin?

1000
02:08:11,638 --> 02:08:13,807
The private life is dead...

1001
02:08:14,392 --> 02:08:16,810
...for a man with any manhood.

1002
02:08:17,645 --> 02:08:20,814
We saw a sample of your manhood
on the way, a place called Mink.

1003
02:08:21,024 --> 02:08:24,026
- They'd been selling horses to the Whites.
- No.

1004
02:08:24,402 --> 02:08:27,947
- It seems you burnt the wrong village.
- They always say that, does it matter?

1005
02:08:28,157 --> 02:08:30,742
A village betrays us, a village is burnt.
Point made.

1006
02:08:31,285 --> 02:08:32,869
Your point, their village.

1007
02:08:33,704 --> 02:08:34,829
Kolya!

1008
02:08:41,421 --> 02:08:44,506
What will you do with your wife
and child in Varykino?

1009
02:08:44,758 --> 02:08:46,550
Just live.

1010
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:50,513
Take him away. He's innocent.

1011
02:09:01,192 --> 02:09:02,275
You're lucky.

1012
02:09:36,772 --> 02:09:39,316
We've been diverted.
Do you know where we're going?

1013
02:09:39,734 --> 02:09:42,236
- Yes. Varykino Halt.
- Thank God.

1014
02:09:55,458 --> 02:09:56,667
Hello?

1015
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:02,006
Hello?

1016
02:10:05,677 --> 02:10:07,262
How lovely.

1017
02:10:11,977 --> 02:10:13,936
Oh, how lovely!

1018
02:10:15,856 --> 02:10:17,481
Hello?

1019
02:10:18,066 --> 02:10:19,150
Hello?

1020
02:10:25,198 --> 02:10:28,743
- Alexander Maximovich?
- Yes.

1021
02:10:29,119 --> 02:10:30,412
It's me, Petya.

1022
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:34,291
- Your Honor.
- Now, now, now.

1023
02:10:34,459 --> 02:10:36,461
That's all done with, you know.

1024
02:10:38,380 --> 02:10:40,423
How do we get to the house, Petya?

1025
02:10:41,091 --> 02:10:42,550
As you always did, Your Honor.

1026
02:11:04,784 --> 02:11:06,117
Look, Sasha.

1027
02:11:10,998 --> 02:11:13,918
What is it, Petya? Forest fire?

1028
02:11:14,169 --> 02:11:17,380
Forest fire, Your Honor?
That's Yuryatin.

1029
02:11:18,757 --> 02:11:21,759
Poor souls. First the Reds,
then the Whites.

1030
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:23,928
Now the Reds again.

1031
02:11:24,179 --> 02:11:27,765
That Strelnikov, his heart must be dead.

1032
02:11:29,101 --> 02:11:30,142
Go on.

1033
02:11:31,061 --> 02:11:32,646
We'll soon be there now, Sasha.

1034
02:11:32,897 --> 02:11:34,399
Another five miles.

1035
02:11:34,566 --> 02:11:38,403
Is it that far? One forgets.
How is the place?

1036
02:11:38,612 --> 02:11:43,282
Well enough, Your Honor.
It's all locked up, you know?

1037
02:12:00,634 --> 02:12:02,177
Varykino.

1038
02:12:53,524 --> 02:12:56,027
All locked up, you see.

1039
02:13:02,118 --> 02:13:04,536
A body, styling itself...

1040
02:13:04,704 --> 02:13:08,081
...the "Yuryatin Committee
of Revolutionary Justice"...

1041
02:13:08,249 --> 02:13:11,835
...has expropriated my house
in the name of the people.

1042
02:13:12,795 --> 02:13:13,837
Very well.

1043
02:13:14,422 --> 02:13:17,467
I'm one of the people too!

1044
02:13:19,094 --> 02:13:22,388
Don't, Your Honor!
They'd call it counterrevolution.

1045
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:28,019
Father, don't. Petya brought us here,
that makes him a counterrevolutionary too.

1046
02:13:28,270 --> 02:13:31,023
They shoot counterrevolutionaries.

1047
02:13:43,537 --> 02:13:46,664
It's not the Reds in the town,
it's the Reds in the forest.

1048
02:13:46,873 --> 02:13:48,582
- Partisans.
- Here?

1049
02:13:48,833 --> 02:13:52,044
Who knows? They go where they want
and they do what they want.

1050
02:13:52,212 --> 02:13:53,879
All we need is a roof, Petya.

1051
02:13:54,047 --> 02:13:55,799
And a bit of garden.

1052
02:13:56,008 --> 02:13:57,927
Is there nowhere?

1053
02:14:01,932 --> 02:14:03,808
They didn't lock the cottage.

1054
02:14:14,403 --> 02:14:16,905
Oh, yes, we can manage here.

1055
02:14:20,535 --> 02:14:22,536
The stove works.

1056
02:14:23,288 --> 02:14:27,542
- I'll find you a few sticks of furniture.
- And some seed potatoes?

1057
02:14:28,085 --> 02:14:31,504
I'm afraid the garden is
dreadfully run back.

1058
02:14:41,683 --> 02:14:43,183
Yes, thank you.

1059
02:15:12,799 --> 02:15:14,258
Well done, my boy.

1060
02:15:14,468 --> 02:15:17,428
I must say, scratch a Russian
and you'll find a peasant.

1061
02:15:17,596 --> 02:15:18,930
I've always said so.

1062
02:15:19,182 --> 02:15:23,310
Well, you're wrong. He works like
a peasant but he isn't a peasant.

1063
02:15:23,562 --> 02:15:25,772
I don't mind, Tonya, really.

1064
02:15:26,023 --> 02:15:28,107
- It's a good life.
- It certainly is.

1065
02:15:28,275 --> 02:15:33,029
I wouldn't be surprised if you two looked
back on this time as one of your best.

1066
02:15:33,947 --> 02:15:37,408
Awfully glad about the expected
new arrival, Yuri.

1067
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:39,911
Anna was born here, you know.

1068
02:15:40,162 --> 02:15:41,746
No, I didn't know that.

1069
02:15:42,081 --> 02:15:43,456
Oh, I'm terribly glad.

1070
02:15:43,624 --> 02:15:46,417
Aha! Here's winged Mercury.

1071
02:15:48,712 --> 02:15:50,880
Looks a bit down in the mouth.

1072
02:15:52,926 --> 02:15:53,967
Petya.

1073
02:15:54,552 --> 02:15:56,220
What news from Yuryatin?

1074
02:15:56,471 --> 02:16:00,266
No lard, no sugar.
Oil next week, perhaps.

1075
02:16:00,518 --> 02:16:03,436
Flour, salt, coffee...

1076
02:16:03,646 --> 02:16:04,813
...and nails.

1077
02:16:09,151 --> 02:16:11,069
Bad news?

1078
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:15,073
- Oh, Lord, not another purge.
- No.

1079
02:16:15,324 --> 02:16:18,618
- Strelnikov's gone.
Well, that's not bad news.

1080
02:16:18,869 --> 02:16:22,874
No, he's in Manchuria, they say.

1081
02:16:26,921 --> 02:16:28,338
That's the news.

1082
02:16:49,445 --> 02:16:51,280
They've shot the Tsar.

1083
02:16:53,658 --> 02:16:55,200
And all his family.

1084
02:16:58,747 --> 02:17:02,083
Oh, that's a savage deed!

1085
02:17:04,378 --> 02:17:06,463
What's it for?

1086
02:17:08,799 --> 02:17:11,050
It's to show there's no going back.

1087
02:18:23,797 --> 02:18:26,757
Yuri, why don't you go to Yuryatin?

1088
02:18:27,050 --> 02:18:30,719
Yes, why don't you, my boy?
It'd do you good.

1089
02:18:31,596 --> 02:18:33,097
Why? What's in Yuryatin?

1090
02:18:34,307 --> 02:18:38,143
It isn't Petersburg.
Very decent little library there.

1091
02:18:38,353 --> 02:18:41,438
- If it's still there.
- I wish you would.

1092
02:18:43,776 --> 02:18:45,528
No, I don't think so.

1093
02:18:46,196 --> 02:18:48,239
Anyway, the roads are blocked.

1094
02:20:52,623 --> 02:20:54,416
Zhivago.

1095
02:20:57,670 --> 02:20:59,212
Yes.

1096
02:21:04,635 --> 02:21:06,302
How are you?

1097
02:21:07,639 --> 02:21:09,433
What are you doing here?

1098
02:21:09,726 --> 02:21:11,351
We're at Varykino.

1099
02:21:13,146 --> 02:21:14,855
Varykino?

1100
02:21:21,112 --> 02:21:22,779
Why Varykino?

1101
02:21:23,031 --> 02:21:25,197
Why not? We had to go somewhere.

1102
02:21:25,449 --> 02:21:27,617
But here?

1103
02:21:28,077 --> 02:21:31,496
I came here to find my husband.
The one who was reported killed.

1104
02:21:31,664 --> 02:21:33,123
Strelnikov.

1105
02:21:33,291 --> 02:21:34,458
I met him.

1106
02:21:35,501 --> 02:21:37,837
- Met him?
- Yes.

1107
02:23:10,981 --> 02:23:13,190
How long have you been living here?

1108
02:23:14,317 --> 02:23:15,818
About a year.

1109
02:23:20,573 --> 02:23:23,116
- Alone?
- With Katya.

1110
02:23:23,909 --> 02:23:27,495
- Where is Katya now?
- At school.

1111
02:24:17,635 --> 02:24:19,427
Is Tonya with you?

1112
02:24:20,429 --> 02:24:21,930
All of us.

1113
02:24:22,306 --> 02:24:24,849
- Sasha?
- Of course.

1114
02:24:29,772 --> 02:24:34,236
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

1115
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:49,565
Yuri?

1116
02:25:51,192 --> 02:25:53,694
It's awfully early, isn't it?

1117
02:25:53,988 --> 02:25:55,697
Half past 6.

1118
02:25:55,948 --> 02:25:57,241
What're you doing?

1119
02:25:58,118 --> 02:26:00,453
Nothing. Couldn't sleep.

1120
02:26:00,662 --> 02:26:03,914
- Is anything the matter?
- No.

1121
02:26:08,545 --> 02:26:10,588
Shall I get some tea?

1122
02:26:12,466 --> 02:26:14,133
Yes, do.

1123
02:27:35,012 --> 02:27:37,765
Hello. You are silly.
We called and called.

1124
02:27:38,016 --> 02:27:40,893
- Did you? I didn't hear.
- Well, we did.

1125
02:27:43,230 --> 02:27:45,481
- Hello, Lara.
- Hello.

1126
02:27:47,693 --> 02:27:51,320
- How's Olya Petrovna?
- She gets worse and worse.

1127
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:54,450
She gave us C.I. and arithmetic
all morning.

1128
02:27:54,701 --> 02:27:57,579
- C.I.?
- Civic Instruction.

1129
02:27:58,038 --> 02:27:59,080
Look.

1130
02:28:01,709 --> 02:28:04,294
- That's very good, Katya.
- Thank you.

1131
02:28:04,628 --> 02:28:06,129
It's the Tsar.

1132
02:28:08,132 --> 02:28:10,717
The Tsar's an enemy
of the people.

1133
02:28:11,802 --> 02:28:14,888
Well, he didn't know he was
an enemy of the people, you know.

1134
02:28:15,097 --> 02:28:17,307
Well, he should've known, shouldn't he?

1135
02:28:17,517 --> 02:28:19,268
Yes, he should.

1136
02:28:19,561 --> 02:28:23,315
Fancy not knowing C.I.
Doesn't your little boy go to school?

1137
02:28:23,566 --> 02:28:24,900
Lunch.

1138
02:28:25,318 --> 02:28:26,568
Good.

1139
02:28:27,069 --> 02:28:28,862
Come on, you.

1140
02:28:59,897 --> 02:29:01,022
Smell.

1141
02:29:02,858 --> 02:29:03,900
What?

1142
02:29:06,194 --> 02:29:08,278
This one's a prizefighter.

1143
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:09,821
Yuri.

1144
02:29:12,116 --> 02:29:13,492
Wait a minute.

1145
02:29:14,494 --> 02:29:15,536
There.

1146
02:29:34,432 --> 02:29:37,601
- I'm going into Yuryatin, darling.
- What, now?

1147
02:29:37,852 --> 02:29:41,064
Yes, I want to get some morphine,
disinfectant.

1148
02:29:41,315 --> 02:29:44,067
- I shan't need morphine.
- You never know.

1149
02:29:44,318 --> 02:29:45,819
I shan't need it today.

1150
02:29:46,070 --> 02:29:48,948
No, but it's pretty close.
I hadn't realized.

1151
02:29:51,159 --> 02:29:53,703
- You'll be back before it's dark?
- Long before.

1152
02:30:07,218 --> 02:30:10,220
Yes, yes, my darling, do what's best.

1153
02:30:10,430 --> 02:30:12,097
I am not coming back.

1154
02:30:12,307 --> 02:30:16,269
- I understand.
- But never, Lara!

1155
02:30:16,979 --> 02:30:18,563
You understand?

1156
02:30:19,940 --> 02:30:21,483
Do you believe me?

1157
02:31:23,634 --> 02:31:26,302
Comrade Doctor,
I need a medical officer.

1158
02:31:26,512 --> 02:31:29,013
Sorry, I have a wife and child
in Varykino.

1159
02:31:29,223 --> 02:31:31,349
And a mistress in Yuryatin.

1160
02:31:33,769 --> 02:31:38,439
Comrade Medical Officer, we are
Red Partisans. And we shoot deserters.

1161
02:32:27,911 --> 02:32:30,788
- Where are you taking me?
- To the front.

1162
02:32:31,248 --> 02:32:34,250
- And where is the front?
- Good question, doctor.

1163
02:32:34,501 --> 02:32:36,961
It's wherever there are
enemies of the Revolution.

1164
02:32:37,129 --> 02:32:41,925
Wherever there is one gang of White
Guards or foreign interventionists.

1165
02:32:42,135 --> 02:32:45,597
Wherever there's one resentful bourgeois,
one unreliable schoolmaster...

1166
02:32:45,765 --> 02:32:48,516
...one dubious poet hugging
his private life.

1167
02:32:48,726 --> 02:32:51,019
That too is the front.

1168
02:32:52,188 --> 02:32:55,689
- How long are you going to keep me?
- For as long as we need you.

1169
02:33:45,912 --> 02:33:47,162
Now!

1170
02:33:56,256 --> 02:33:57,548
Charge!

1171
02:34:54,693 --> 02:34:56,193
Well, that was easy.

1172
02:34:56,528 --> 02:34:58,946
Come on, doctor, let's see
what we've done.

1173
02:35:44,288 --> 02:35:47,248
St. Michael's Military School.

1174
02:35:52,756 --> 02:35:55,800
You old bastard!

1175
02:36:06,562 --> 02:36:07,980
It doesn't matter.

1176
02:36:11,902 --> 02:36:14,487
Did you ever love a woman, Razin?

1177
02:36:14,780 --> 02:36:16,948
I once had a wife and four children.

1178
02:36:30,423 --> 02:36:33,299
He has been a good comrade.
And a good medic.

1179
02:36:33,467 --> 02:36:36,720
We took him from his wife,
we took him from his child.

1180
02:36:36,887 --> 02:36:38,763
None of this matters.

1181
02:36:39,598 --> 02:36:43,601
What does matter, Comrade Commissar?
Tell me, I've forgotten.

1182
02:36:43,853 --> 02:36:47,187
- This is contemptible. The doctor stays.
- I command this unit!

1183
02:36:47,439 --> 02:36:51,067
We command jointly.
The Party bulletin expressly states...

1184
02:36:53,279 --> 02:36:56,281
I could have you taken out and shot.

1185
02:36:57,074 --> 02:36:59,326
And could you have the Party
taken out and shot?

1186
02:36:59,578 --> 02:37:04,749
As the military struggle nears its close,
the political struggle intensifies.

1187
02:37:05,292 --> 02:37:07,960
In victory, the military
will have served its purpose.

1188
02:37:08,170 --> 02:37:10,880
All men will then be judged
politically...

1189
02:37:11,257 --> 02:37:14,217
...regardless of their
military record.

1190
02:37:15,845 --> 02:37:20,265
Meanwhile, there are still White Units
in this area. The doctor stays.

1191
02:37:20,475 --> 02:37:22,976
That concludes the meeting.

1192
02:38:14,826 --> 02:38:17,202
Comrade, where are you going?

1193
02:38:17,411 --> 02:38:20,163
Are you running away, comrade?

1194
02:38:20,832 --> 02:38:23,959
- Soldiers.
- Red soldiers or White soldiers?

1195
02:38:24,210 --> 02:38:25,962
Soldiers.

1196
02:40:14,787 --> 02:40:16,080
Tonya?

1197
02:40:17,082 --> 02:40:20,042
Tonya! Sasha!

1198
02:40:22,630 --> 02:40:24,005
Tonya!

1199
02:40:27,468 --> 02:40:29,177
Tonya!

1200
02:40:31,264 --> 02:40:33,306
Tonya! Hey!

1201
02:40:36,852 --> 02:40:39,396
Tonya! Tonya!

1202
02:41:28,742 --> 02:41:32,619
- This is Yuryatin?
Yes, Yuryatin.

1203
02:41:33,246 --> 02:41:34,955
What's happened at Varykino?

1204
02:41:35,206 --> 02:41:38,043
- Moscow folks?
- Yes.

1205
02:41:38,294 --> 02:41:42,839
They've gone away. Gone away.
There's nobody at Varykino.

1206
02:42:34,978 --> 02:42:38,314
Lord, what happiness!
They say you're alive.

1207
02:42:38,565 --> 02:42:40,609
Someone saw you near the town.

1208
02:42:40,819 --> 02:42:44,655
I take it you've gone to Varykino,
so I'm going there myself with Katya.

1209
02:42:44,907 --> 02:42:48,410
Just in case, I've left a little food.
Boiled potatoes mostly.

1210
02:42:48,661 --> 02:42:51,454
Put the lid back on the pan
or the rats will get it.

1211
02:42:51,705 --> 02:42:54,999
I'm mad with joy!

1212
02:44:10,290 --> 02:44:11,374
Tonya.

1213
02:44:13,127 --> 02:44:14,669
Tonya!

1214
02:44:15,171 --> 02:44:17,088
- Yuri.
- Tonya!

1215
02:44:17,340 --> 02:44:19,132
- Yuri.
- Tonya.

1216
02:44:19,383 --> 02:44:21,551
Yuri, darling.

1217
02:44:35,650 --> 02:44:37,817
It's all right, Yuri.

1218
02:44:38,069 --> 02:44:41,155
They're safe. They're in Moscow.

1219
02:44:41,365 --> 02:44:43,492
- In Moscow?
- Yes.

1220
02:44:43,868 --> 02:44:47,496
- Tonya?
- All of them. They're safe.

1221
02:44:48,748 --> 02:44:50,123
Safe.

1222
02:44:52,627 --> 02:44:54,962
Firing squads!

1223
02:45:32,545 --> 02:45:33,712
Better.

1224
02:45:42,681 --> 02:45:43,931
What?

1225
02:45:45,310 --> 02:45:47,477
I've got a letter for you.

1226
02:45:47,687 --> 02:45:49,563
I've had it three months.

1227
02:45:51,608 --> 02:45:54,151
And it was three months getting here.

1228
02:45:54,402 --> 02:45:56,028
It's from Moscow.

1229
02:45:58,156 --> 02:46:00,032
I think it's from Tonya.

1230
02:46:00,283 --> 02:46:02,909
It's addressed to you, care of me.

1231
02:46:04,913 --> 02:46:08,959
She came into Yuryatin to find you
when you vanished.

1232
02:46:09,210 --> 02:46:11,170
Someone sent her here.

1233
02:46:11,421 --> 02:46:12,921
You met?

1234
02:46:15,717 --> 02:46:17,718
She's very fine.

1235
02:46:27,812 --> 02:46:29,730
My dearest dear.

1236
02:46:29,981 --> 02:46:32,733
I'm sending this
to Larissa Antipova's...

1237
02:46:32,942 --> 02:46:35,987
...because if you are alive,
which God grant...

1238
02:46:36,238 --> 02:46:38,823
...I think that is where you will go.

1239
02:46:39,075 --> 02:46:42,661
We have a little daughter, Yuri.
Did you know?

1240
02:46:42,870 --> 02:46:44,621
Her name's Anna.

1241
02:46:44,830 --> 02:46:46,832
Father sends greetings.

1242
02:46:47,084 --> 02:46:51,087
Sasha has grown quite a lot.
He's quite big now.

1243
02:46:51,838 --> 02:46:56,217
Whenever we speak of you,
he weeps and won't be comforted.

1244
02:46:56,468 --> 02:46:58,219
This is what I have to tell you:

1245
02:46:58,470 --> 02:47:01,013
We are being deported from Russia.

1246
02:47:01,264 --> 02:47:04,726
We can't make out
if you'd be allowed to join us.

1247
02:47:04,977 --> 02:47:09,023
An organization in Paris, which I
mustn't name, will know where we are.

1248
02:47:09,274 --> 02:47:11,984
But nothing is certain,
and there's very little time.

1249
02:47:12,194 --> 02:47:14,237
I'm writing this in haste.

1250
02:47:14,488 --> 02:47:18,324
They're coming for us now.
God bless you.

1251
02:47:19,118 --> 02:47:23,204
I must honestly admit
that Antipova is a good person.

1252
02:47:33,634 --> 02:47:38,012
Yuri, when they got away to Moscow,
she left something here.

1253
02:48:14,011 --> 02:48:15,595
Yuri?

1254
02:48:40,789 --> 02:48:42,289
May I come in?

1255
02:48:44,375 --> 02:48:47,503
Yuri Andreyevich,
you've changed, I think.

1256
02:48:48,630 --> 02:48:51,257
Oh, yes, decidedly.

1257
02:48:52,134 --> 02:48:53,551
Larissa...

1258
02:48:55,304 --> 02:48:57,305
...remarkably the same.

1259
02:49:04,564 --> 02:49:06,482
I came from Moscow.

1260
02:49:07,400 --> 02:49:09,611
I'm on the way to Vladivostok.

1261
02:49:17,078 --> 02:49:18,745
I'm here to offer you my help.

1262
02:49:18,996 --> 02:49:20,455
We don't want it.

1263
02:49:20,706 --> 02:49:23,208
- Speak for yourself.
- We don't want it.

1264
02:49:23,668 --> 02:49:27,337
Yuri Andreyevich, you spent two years
with the Partisan's 5th Division.

1265
02:49:27,547 --> 02:49:30,092
You have no discharge,
so you are a deserter.

1266
02:49:30,343 --> 02:49:34,137
Your family in Paris is involved
in a dangerous émigré organization.

1267
02:49:34,347 --> 02:49:37,099
Now, all these are technicalities.

1268
02:49:37,475 --> 02:49:38,892
But your style of life...

1269
02:49:39,143 --> 02:49:44,565
...everything you say, your published
writings, are all flagrantly subversive.

1270
02:49:44,858 --> 02:49:46,567
Your days are numbered...

1271
02:49:47,110 --> 02:49:48,902
...unless I help you.

1272
02:49:49,153 --> 02:49:52,949
- Do you want my help?
- No.

1273
02:49:53,826 --> 02:49:55,285
Wait, Yuri.

1274
02:50:00,375 --> 02:50:02,334
Larissa, three glasses.

1275
02:50:02,878 --> 02:50:04,461
No.

1276
02:50:04,713 --> 02:50:08,591
Yuri, you must see
how serious this is.

1277
02:50:11,094 --> 02:50:13,095
Please don't underestimate me.

1278
02:50:13,346 --> 02:50:16,599
Practically or morally,
I'm not the man you take me for.

1279
02:50:18,852 --> 02:50:23,397
How do you know all this about Yuri?
How can you help?

1280
02:50:23,690 --> 02:50:26,026
I do and I can. Isnt that sufficient?

1281
02:50:26,277 --> 02:50:27,569
No.

1282
02:50:41,460 --> 02:50:44,670
Our Eastern Seaboard is
an undeveloped area.

1283
02:50:45,297 --> 02:50:49,884
The commissariat of foreign affairs wants
to establish an independent state there.

1284
02:50:50,385 --> 02:50:55,183
It affords us a temporary channel of
communication with the outside world.

1285
02:50:55,392 --> 02:50:58,853
I have good contacts in the Far East.

1286
02:50:59,396 --> 02:51:02,023
I've been appointed
the Minister of Justice.

1287
02:51:02,274 --> 02:51:05,151
- The Bolsheviks trust you?
- They trust no one.

1288
02:51:05,402 --> 02:51:07,195
They found me useful.

1289
02:51:12,284 --> 02:51:14,286
Here's how I can help you.

1290
02:51:14,913 --> 02:51:18,999
You come with me as far
as the Pacific Coast.

1291
02:51:19,250 --> 02:51:21,168
From there you can go
where you like.

1292
02:51:22,504 --> 02:51:24,631
To Paris, or not.

1293
02:51:26,050 --> 02:51:27,425
I think you'd better go.

1294
02:51:28,260 --> 02:51:33,265
Your rarefied selfishness is intolerable.

1295
02:51:33,517 --> 02:51:35,351
Larissa's in danger too.

1296
02:51:36,019 --> 02:51:38,270
- By association with me?
- No.

1297
02:51:38,522 --> 02:51:41,649
Not by association with you.
You're a small fry.

1298
02:51:41,900 --> 02:51:44,276
By association with Strelnikov.

1299
02:51:44,653 --> 02:51:48,948
- I never met Strelnikov.
- You're married to him, they know that.

1300
02:51:49,199 --> 02:51:53,161
- I was married to Pasha Antipov.
- I understand, I understand.

1301
02:51:53,413 --> 02:51:55,164
But they don't.

1302
02:51:55,374 --> 02:51:57,667
You're being watched.

1303
02:51:58,127 --> 02:51:59,669
Do you know why?

1304
02:52:00,921 --> 02:52:04,674
A husband is a sticky commodity,
my dear.

1305
02:52:05,843 --> 02:52:06,883
Go away.

1306
02:52:09,971 --> 02:52:13,932
More of your high-minded lunacy?

1307
02:52:14,685 --> 02:52:16,519
You have a child to think of!

1308
02:52:17,062 --> 02:52:18,312
Look here.

1309
02:52:20,734 --> 02:52:24,361
- That's sugar for the child.
- I don't want it.

1310
02:52:25,155 --> 02:52:27,656
You would refuse my sugar?

1311
02:52:28,742 --> 02:52:30,451
Who are you to refuse me anything?!

1312
02:52:30,994 --> 02:52:32,703
Now you go.

1313
02:52:36,167 --> 02:52:37,667
- I came...
- Go!

1314
02:52:38,794 --> 02:52:40,003
Go!

1315
02:52:41,297 --> 02:52:44,215
I came to you in good faith.

1316
02:52:48,929 --> 02:52:51,849
Stay here then,
and get your desserts!

1317
02:52:55,146 --> 02:52:57,939
Your desserts, do you hear me?

1318
02:53:01,235 --> 02:53:03,862
Do you think you're immaculate?

1319
02:53:07,366 --> 02:53:09,409
You're not immaculate!

1320
02:53:11,287 --> 02:53:13,371
I know you!

1321
02:53:14,540 --> 02:53:16,334
Do you hear me?!

1322
02:53:16,877 --> 02:53:22,299
We're all made of the same clay,
you know!

1323
02:53:23,176 --> 02:53:25,135
Clay!

1324
02:53:25,804 --> 02:53:27,805
Clay!

1325
02:53:32,402 --> 02:53:33,527
Lara?

1326
02:53:36,573 --> 02:53:38,490
He's rubbish, Lara.

1327
02:53:39,451 --> 02:53:41,619
Yes. Rubbish.

1328
02:53:43,747 --> 02:53:46,207
I wish he'd never happened.

1329
02:53:46,626 --> 02:53:48,294
Does it matter?

1330
02:53:48,712 --> 02:53:50,046
Doesn't it?

1331
02:53:50,589 --> 02:53:52,048
Not to me.

1332
02:54:01,349 --> 02:54:04,225
What shall we do?
Can we get on a train?

1333
02:54:04,435 --> 02:54:05,977
No, they'd arrest us on the spot.

1334
02:54:07,271 --> 02:54:11,441
- I don't want to stay here and wait.
- No.

1335
02:54:13,611 --> 02:54:14,779
Listen...

1336
02:54:16,115 --> 02:54:19,159
...we could go to...
- Varykino.

1337
02:54:20,828 --> 02:54:25,082
- They'd find out sooner or later.
- Yes, but later.

1338
02:54:25,583 --> 02:54:28,543
- If our days are really numbered, Yuri...
- Yes.

1339
02:54:28,795 --> 02:54:30,629
We'd better live them...

1340
02:54:32,799 --> 02:54:35,008
...before we are parted.

1341
02:54:35,593 --> 02:54:36,677
Yes.

1342
02:54:53,905 --> 02:54:56,615
Yo ho! Yo ho!

1343
02:56:02,852 --> 02:56:06,355
Father caught a flea! Ho, ho, ho

1344
02:56:06,607 --> 02:56:09,525
I love the snow
One, two, three

1345
02:57:15,347 --> 02:57:17,640
Anna taught me to write at this desk.

1346
03:01:14,059 --> 03:01:16,268
This isn't me, Yuri.

1347
03:01:16,853 --> 03:01:20,189
- Yes, it is.
- No.

1348
03:01:21,358 --> 03:01:22,817
It's you.

1349
03:01:27,740 --> 03:01:29,199
"Lara. "

1350
03:02:19,169 --> 03:02:20,502
Yuri!

1351
03:02:21,337 --> 03:02:24,882
- Yuri, there's a wolf howling!
- Oh, yes, I've...

1352
03:02:29,264 --> 03:02:32,516
I've seen them. They're frightened.
They won't harm us.

1353
03:02:32,767 --> 03:02:35,102
Yes, I know.

1354
03:02:35,937 --> 03:02:38,230
I'm sorry. It's...

1355
03:02:46,364 --> 03:02:49,617
Oh, Lord, this is an awful time
to be alive!

1356
03:02:49,868 --> 03:02:52,453
- No.
- It is. It is!

1357
03:02:52,704 --> 03:02:54,289
No, no.

1358
03:03:58,858 --> 03:04:01,610
Wouldn't it have been lovely
if we'd met before?

1359
03:04:01,820 --> 03:04:04,572
Before we did? Yes.

1360
03:04:07,742 --> 03:04:10,619
We'd have got married,
had a house and children.

1361
03:04:13,790 --> 03:04:18,043
If we'd had children, Yuri,
would you have liked a boy or a girl?

1362
03:04:19,255 --> 03:04:23,426
I think we may go mad
if we think about all that.

1363
03:04:24,011 --> 03:04:26,095
I shall always think about it.

1364
03:04:27,347 --> 03:04:30,224
- Will you write today?
- No, not today.

1365
03:04:50,289 --> 03:04:51,623
Katya!

1366
03:04:52,249 --> 03:04:53,791
Come to me, darling.

1367
03:05:01,717 --> 03:05:03,426
They're here.

1368
03:05:06,764 --> 03:05:08,014
Victor!

1369
03:05:09,391 --> 03:05:10,808
We thought it was...

1370
03:05:12,478 --> 03:05:13,812
Quite.

1371
03:05:15,815 --> 03:05:17,650
I wonder if you'd mind, comrades?

1372
03:05:22,823 --> 03:05:25,408
My government has a train,
standing in Yuryatin.

1373
03:05:25,660 --> 03:05:28,495
There's a carriage for myself
and my assistants.

1374
03:05:28,704 --> 03:05:31,623
You will travel in comfort and safety.

1375
03:05:31,832 --> 03:05:33,624
No question. I'm not going with you.

1376
03:05:33,875 --> 03:05:37,336
I'm not going without you.
So there's an end to it.

1377
03:05:37,671 --> 03:05:40,924
Then I'll have to speak
to Yuri Andreyevich in private.

1378
03:05:56,441 --> 03:05:58,442
Strelnikov is dead.

1379
03:05:58,735 --> 03:06:01,779
- What?
- Spare me your expressions of regret.

1380
03:06:02,030 --> 03:06:05,533
He was a murderous neurotic,
and no loss to anyone.

1381
03:06:06,535 --> 03:06:08,662
Do you see how this affects Larissa?

1382
03:06:08,955 --> 03:06:10,831
You don't?

1383
03:06:11,124 --> 03:06:13,041
You're a fool.

1384
03:06:17,214 --> 03:06:18,881
She's Strelnikov's wife.

1385
03:06:19,091 --> 03:06:21,759
Why do you think
they haven't arrested her?

1386
03:06:21,927 --> 03:06:26,597
Why do you think they had her watched?
They were waiting for Strelnikov.

1387
03:06:27,099 --> 03:06:31,060
If they thought he'd come running
to his wife, they didn't know him.

1388
03:06:31,311 --> 03:06:35,690
They knew him well enough.
They caught him five miles from here.

1389
03:06:35,942 --> 03:06:39,111
He was arrested on the open road.
He didn't conceal his identity.

1390
03:06:39,279 --> 03:06:40,863
Throughout the entire interview...

1391
03:06:41,030 --> 03:06:43,490
...he insisted they call him
Pavel Antipov...

1392
03:06:43,700 --> 03:06:46,077
...and refused to answer
to "Strelnikov. "

1393
03:06:46,787 --> 03:06:50,749
On his way to execution, he took
a pistol and blew his own brains out.

1394
03:06:51,751 --> 03:06:53,501
Oh, my God!

1395
03:06:55,129 --> 03:06:56,379
Don't tell Lara this.

1396
03:06:56,672 --> 03:06:59,132
I think I know Lara at least
as well as you.

1397
03:06:59,508 --> 03:07:03,052
But don't you see her position?
She's served her purpose.

1398
03:07:03,262 --> 03:07:08,684
These men who came to escort me today
will come tomorrow as a firing squad.

1399
03:07:08,977 --> 03:07:13,148
Now I know exactly what you think
of me, and why.

1400
03:07:13,399 --> 03:07:16,318
But if you're not coming with me,
she's not coming.

1401
03:07:17,278 --> 03:07:19,571
So are you coming with me?

1402
03:07:19,906 --> 03:07:25,327
Do you accept the protection of this
ignoble Caliban on any terms he makes?

1403
03:07:25,787 --> 03:07:28,120
Or is your delicacy so exorbitant...

1404
03:07:28,330 --> 03:07:31,500
...that you'd sacrifice a woman
and a child to it?

1405
03:07:41,260 --> 03:07:43,971
There's some bags to carry, comrades.

1406
03:08:00,490 --> 03:08:01,698
Get in.

1407
03:08:06,287 --> 03:08:07,538
Come.

1408
03:08:11,418 --> 03:08:12,544
How many?
All of us.

1409
03:08:12,962 --> 03:08:15,880
Sorry, not enough room.
There's got to be room.

1410
03:08:16,090 --> 03:08:18,299
It's all right. I'll bring our sledge.

1411
03:08:18,467 --> 03:08:21,219
Hurry.
This train has important people on it.

1412
03:08:21,470 --> 03:08:23,680
You start. I'll catch you up.

1413
03:08:29,646 --> 03:08:30,896
Right, comrades!

1414
03:08:33,316 --> 03:08:35,067
We'll see you at...

1415
03:08:35,735 --> 03:08:36,986
Hurry!

1416
03:10:12,755 --> 03:10:15,632
I'm afraid that's it.
Your young man's not coming.

1417
03:10:16,510 --> 03:10:17,551
You fool.

1418
03:10:18,971 --> 03:10:21,430
Did you really think
he would come with you?

1419
03:10:31,024 --> 03:10:32,692
The man's an idiot.

1420
03:10:34,362 --> 03:10:38,365
- From Mongolia he could've gone to China...
- He'll never leave Russia.

1421
03:10:38,574 --> 03:10:40,617
Let him stay.
You've come with me, haven't you?

1422
03:10:42,578 --> 03:10:43,788
Yes.

1423
03:10:45,249 --> 03:10:47,750
To be sure, it was your duty as a mother.

1424
03:10:48,961 --> 03:10:50,837
That's right, Victor.

1425
03:10:53,424 --> 03:10:55,842
I'm carrying Yuri's child.

1426
03:11:01,140 --> 03:11:04,810
I was born out there.
In the Far East somewhere.

1427
03:11:04,978 --> 03:11:07,271
I think it was Mongolia.
I don't remember.

1428
03:11:07,439 --> 03:11:10,232
You were born in Mongolia,
that very year.

1429
03:11:10,483 --> 03:11:12,318
So were a lot of other children.

1430
03:11:12,486 --> 03:11:15,989
Not many called Tonya,
bearing the name Komarov.

1431
03:11:16,157 --> 03:11:17,823
Komarov's a common name.
So is Tonya.

1432
03:11:18,074 --> 03:11:23,162
With fair hair, blue eyes, lost at age 8
when civil war broke out in the Far East?

1433
03:11:23,371 --> 03:11:27,791
There's something you haven't told me.
How did you come to be lost?

1434
03:11:28,043 --> 03:11:31,003
- I can't remember!
- You must remember something!

1435
03:11:31,254 --> 03:11:32,547
No!

1436
03:11:33,799 --> 03:11:36,092
I'll tell you how I first
met your mother.

1437
03:11:36,343 --> 03:11:39,138
- If she was my mother, Comrade General.
- You judge.

1438
03:11:39,389 --> 03:11:42,349
I picked my brother up,
literally, on a Moscow street.

1439
03:11:43,060 --> 03:11:46,353
He had a fourth-class ration book
and he was undernourished.

1440
03:11:46,605 --> 03:11:49,315
He didn't seem to mind that
or anything.

1441
03:11:49,524 --> 03:11:52,359
I thought he was a happier man
than me.

1442
03:11:53,361 --> 03:11:56,113
He suffered me to buy him a new suit...

1443
03:11:56,323 --> 03:11:59,033
...and to get him a job
at his old hospital.

1444
03:11:59,743 --> 03:12:02,162
I saw him off for his first day's work.

1445
03:12:02,538 --> 03:12:07,043
This was eight years
after he and Lara parted.

1446
03:12:08,545 --> 03:12:10,088
So he never saw her again?

1447
03:12:15,177 --> 03:12:17,595
Thank you. You've been very kind to me.

1448
03:12:24,812 --> 03:12:26,771
He must've known how ill he was.

1449
03:12:26,980 --> 03:12:29,107
The walls of his heart
were like paper.

1450
03:12:29,316 --> 03:12:31,151
But he kept it to himself.

1451
03:12:31,611 --> 03:12:33,696
He kept a lot to himself.

1452
03:12:58,055 --> 03:12:59,098
Please.

1453
03:14:05,294 --> 03:14:09,088
I was astonished
at the extent of his reputation.

1454
03:14:09,298 --> 03:14:11,466
His work was unobtainable
at the time.

1455
03:14:11,717 --> 03:14:14,260
It was disapproved of by the Party.

1456
03:14:14,511 --> 03:14:17,847
But if people love poetry,
they love poets.

1457
03:14:18,098 --> 03:14:20,225
And nobody loves poetry
like a Russian.

1458
03:14:30,613 --> 03:14:32,322
Excuse me, comrade.

1459
03:14:33,324 --> 03:14:34,824
Are you Yevgraf?

1460
03:14:35,785 --> 03:14:37,160
My name is Lara.

1461
03:14:37,411 --> 03:14:42,374
I knew her name from the Lara poems
which I'd found among Yuri's manuscripts.

1462
03:14:42,625 --> 03:14:44,626
I knew your brother.

1463
03:14:46,254 --> 03:14:47,379
I need your help.

1464
03:14:48,172 --> 03:14:51,092
She'd come to Moscow
to look for her child.

1465
03:14:51,301 --> 03:14:53,595
I helped her as far as I could.

1466
03:14:56,975 --> 03:14:58,642
But I knew it was hopeless.

1467
03:15:04,732 --> 03:15:07,150
I think I was a little in love with her.

1468
03:15:15,784 --> 03:15:17,952
One day she went away
and didn't come back.

1469
03:15:18,746 --> 03:15:21,248
She died or vanished somewhere...

1470
03:15:21,499 --> 03:15:23,626
...in one of the labor camps.

1471
03:15:23,877 --> 03:15:28,506
A nameless number on a list
that was afterwards mislaid.

1472
03:15:28,757 --> 03:15:31,843
That was quite common in those days.

1473
03:15:39,768 --> 03:15:40,935
Tonya.

1474
03:15:41,687 --> 03:15:44,272
How did you come to be lost?

1475
03:15:45,608 --> 03:15:47,651
- We were running in a street.
- We?

1476
03:15:47,902 --> 03:15:50,195
- My father.
- Not your father. Komarovsky.

1477
03:15:50,447 --> 03:15:52,073
I don't know!

1478
03:15:52,325 --> 03:15:54,075
The street was on fire.

1479
03:15:54,285 --> 03:15:58,038
There were explosions
and houses were falling down.

1480
03:15:59,915 --> 03:16:02,834
He let go of my hand!

1481
03:16:03,419 --> 03:16:06,379
He let go of my hand.

1482
03:16:07,214 --> 03:16:09,090
And I was lost.

1483
03:16:11,969 --> 03:16:14,263
Would your father have done that?

1484
03:16:14,473 --> 03:16:17,641
Oh, yes. People will do anything.

1485
03:16:17,851 --> 03:16:19,936
It was Komarovsky.

1486
03:16:22,732 --> 03:16:27,027
This man was your father.

1487
03:16:28,821 --> 03:16:30,989
Why won't you believe it?

1488
03:16:31,866 --> 03:16:33,909
Don't you want to believe it?

1489
03:16:34,702 --> 03:16:37,037
Not if it isn't true.

1490
03:16:40,249 --> 03:16:41,834
That's inherited.

1491
03:16:42,086 --> 03:16:46,631
Comrade General, when I was a child,
I wanted parents.

1492
03:16:46,840 --> 03:16:49,968
You can imagine how I wanted parents.

1493
03:16:50,762 --> 03:16:53,722
I wanted to die when I was a child.

1494
03:16:54,099 --> 03:16:55,182
You know?

1495
03:16:58,186 --> 03:17:00,604
Now I don't know.

1496
03:17:01,856 --> 03:17:04,816
I can't be of any use to them now,
can I?

1497
03:17:05,442 --> 03:17:08,320
I was hoping I might be
of some use to you.

1498
03:17:10,365 --> 03:17:12,616
- Will you think about it?
- Yes.

1499
03:17:18,958 --> 03:17:20,834
It's all right, David.

1500
03:17:24,130 --> 03:17:25,213
You work here?

1501
03:17:25,423 --> 03:17:26,881
Yes, I'm an operator.

1502
03:17:27,133 --> 03:17:30,468
- And what do you operate?
- That.

1503
03:17:46,988 --> 03:17:49,072
You've promised to think about it.

1504
03:18:01,961 --> 03:18:03,212
Tonya!

1505
03:18:04,840 --> 03:18:06,507
Can you play the balalaika?

1506
03:18:06,717 --> 03:18:09,719
Can she play? She's an artist!

1507
03:18:09,970 --> 03:18:12,638
An artist? Who taught you?

1508
03:18:12,848 --> 03:18:14,098
No one taught her.

1509
03:18:16,728 --> 03:18:18,604
Then it's a gift.
