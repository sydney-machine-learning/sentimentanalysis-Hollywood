1
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,509
<i>What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-o-o</i>

2
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,794
<i>What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-o-o-o</i>

3
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,558
<i>Pussycat, pussycat</i>

4
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,073
<i>I've got flowers
and lots of hours to spend with you</i>

5
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,911
<i>So go and powder
your cute little pussycat nose</i>

6
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,635
<i>Pussycat, pussycat, I love you</i>

7
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,275
<i>Yes, I do</i>

8
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,517
<i>You and your pussycat nose</i>

9
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,989
<i>What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-o-o</i>

10
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,352
<i>What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-o-o-o</i>

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,231
<i>Pussycat, pussycat</i>

12
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,718
<i>You're delicious
and if my wishes can all come true</i>

13
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,597
<i>I'll soon be kissing
your sweet little pussycat lips</i>

14
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,315
<i>Pussycat, pussycat, I love you</i>

15
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,876
<i>Yes, I do</i>

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,514
<i>You and your pussycat lips</i>

17
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,914
<i>Whoa-o-o</i>

18
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,395
<i>You and your pussycat eyes</i>

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,589
<i>Whoa-o-o</i>

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,273
<i>You and your pussycat nose</i>

21
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,200
<i>- Who is she?
- Get into the kitchen!</i>

22
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,279
<i>- Adulterer!
- You're a monster!</i>

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,075
<i>Swine! Who is she?</i>

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,437
Anna! I have told you never
to bother me here at work!

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,596
Who is she?

26
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,235
We have been through all that.
Get into the kitchen!

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,515
- Why didn't you come home?
- Leave me alone, I'm trying to work.

28
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,996
- Is she prettier than me?
- Is she prettier than you?

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,192
- I am prettier than you!
- Oh! No!

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,836
- Lipstick on your shirt!
- Well, nobody's perfect.

31
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,509
<i>I know she's not the first!</i>

32
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,871
<i>I hate you!</i>

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,275
I hate you!

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,955
I've hated you from the moment
I first married you.

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,153
- You're a grotesque!
- Lascivious adulterer!

36
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,353
Don't you dare call me that again
until I have looked it up!

37
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,948
Adulterer! Adulterer!

38
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,036
Lascivious adulterer!

39
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,993
Silence when you're shouting at me!

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,190
Lascivious adulterer. Lasciv...

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,438
"Lascivious adulterer is a man
that is a lascivious adulterer."

42
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,350
What kind of book is that? You are
a monster and a monster, in that order.

43
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,109
Fritz plays around with the floozies!

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,596
Swine! Get out of my office!

45
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,994
I'll break every bone in your ox's body.

46
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,270
Vermin!

47
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,039
Do you realise I could slay you
any moment I like?

48
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,551
- Pig!
- Using the great Burt's judo method.

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,636
Argh... Agh.

50
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,758
- Ooh!
- Argh!

51
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,149
Get out of here.
We'll finish this later.

52
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,478
Don't be a bit surprised if I take
the children and leave for good.

53
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,555
That great, rotten, stinking hulk of...

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,716
Rotten, rotten, rotten pig!

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,071
Fat, great, stinking rotten... I hate you!

56
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,715
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!

57
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,874
Good afternoon. Am I late?

58
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,196
No, as a matter of fact
you are just on time.

59
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,439
Come, come. Make yourself
nice and comfortable. We will begin.

60
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,948
Women have always been
a big problem to me, Dr Fassbender.

61
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,990
- Are you listening, Doctor?
- Yes, yes, yes. Go on, go on, go on.

62
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,638
The first woman I had a crush on
was my schoolteacher.

63
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,038
- Miss Marks.
- That's a perfectly normal occurrence.

64
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,235
Did you read the essay I wrote
on my summer holidays?

65
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,639
Yes, I did. I thought it was
the most moving piece I'd ever read.

66
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,436
I hope you noticed
I dedicated it to you, Miss Marks.

67
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,630
Call me Tandalaya.

68
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,828
Oh, Michael, this can't work.
I'm 34 and you're 12.

69
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,951
Don't be negative.

70
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,755
Oh, Michael.
Michael, what's to become of us?

71
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,633
And what did become?

72
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,548
She lost her licence and I failed English.

73
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,309
Can I tell you what
I once did in a Latvian brothel?

74
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,635
- Later.
- Oh.

75
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,835
My second experience with a woman
was no picnic either. It was at high school.

76
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,033
What did I do? What did I do? What
did I do? Someone tell me what I did.

77
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,390
What did I do? Tell me what I did.

78
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,399
Jenny! Will you tell me what I did?
Will you tell me, please, what I did?

79
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,717
What am I supposed to have done?
What have I done?

80
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,311
It's no use looking like the Day
of Judgment unless you tell me. Tell me!

81
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,113
- And did you do it?
- I was untutored in these matters.

82
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,028
And women have always
overcome my basic shyness.

83
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,630
But you had a perfectly normal
sexual life at college?

84
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,354
Normal? It was frightening.

85
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,233
I was captain of the debating team,
do you see?

86
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,592
I was competing for the interscholastic
championship by debating a Miss Pringle

87
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,156
on the effects of socialised medicine
on the British economy.

88
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,238
- And what happened?
- I convinced her.

89
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,077
Love is not to be found,

90
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,430
is not to be taken.

91
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,676
It is to be given.

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,430
You may despise simple faith.
But what is simple faith but healing?

93
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,597
Abandon notions of socialised medicine.
What is it?

94
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,759
Medicine does not belong
to the Hypocritic oath... Oh!

95
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,232
And when did all this come to an end?

96
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,148
It didn't come to an end.
That's the point.

97
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,909
My job is a lecher's dream.

98
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,232
Feature editor for
a big fashion magazine in Paris.

99
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,434
<i>The receptionist is beautiful.</i>

100
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,471
- Good morning, Mr James.
- Good morning.

101
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,556
<i>The copywriters are beautiful.</i>

102
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,432
<i>Bonjour, Monsieur James.</i>

103
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,869
<i>- Bonjour, Monsieur James.
- Bonjour.</i>

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,834
<i>The secretaries are beautiful.
And the models!</i>

105
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,474
<i>- What about the models?
- Oh, my gawd.</i>

106
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,639
- Good morning, Mr James.
- Good morning.

107
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,910
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr James.

108
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,996
Oh, hello, Gladys.

109
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,512
<i>Can you imagine what it feels like
to be in close contact every day</i>

110
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,030
<i>with the world's most gorgeous women?
And what can I do?</i>

111
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,151
I can't say no.

112
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,669
And why should I say no?
I love it, do you hear?

113
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,553
I love every second of it.

114
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,958
That's how it's always been with me.
A little pleasure, a little pain,

115
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,436
but always back to the ladies.

116
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,358
So what is your problem?

117
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,711
Carole. I met her at a language school.

118
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,436
She wants to get married
and I'm afraid to commit myself.

119
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,679
- Do you love her?
- Oh, surely.

120
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,949
Mm.

121
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,916
But you are afraid to marry her because
you are not ready to give up other women.

122
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,554
Quite right.

123
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,036
Then why don't you marry her and cheat?

124
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,197
That's exactly what I want to avoid.
That's why I came to you.

125
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,551
I respect her too much
to do anything like that.

126
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,639
<i>I think that, with you, sex is a sport,ja?</i>

127
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,799
Oh, yes. I love the... the smell of perfume,

128
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,596
and the thrill of the chase
and the moment of conquest.

129
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,191
- I like thighs. Do you like thighs?
- Mm.

130
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,032
Look, I know you'll
think this is crazy, but...

131
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,790
when the light hits me
in a certain direction, I'm... handsome.

132
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,273
Oh.

133
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,590
Listen, I'll see you next Friday.
I've got phone calls to make.

134
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,676
I've only been here 15 minutes.

135
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,156
I can't take more than 15 minutes
of your sex life at one time.

136
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,034
Look, why don't you come
to some of my group analysis meetings?

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,597
Maybe if there's other people around
it's going to be easier for both of us.

138
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,111
Hello, Zsa Zsa? This is Fritz.
How are you, my little flesh pudding?

139
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,913
Hold on.
Listen, you'll like this group analysis.

140
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,191
It's a real freak show.
If it gets dull, we sing songs.

141
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,038
Oh.

142
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,152
Do you think it'll help?
I'll do anything to achieve Carole.

143
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,115
Well, if it fails we will try something else.
I use all kinds of unorthodox methods.

144
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,949
For example, I have had great success
shutting people in dark closets.

145
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,274
Really?

146
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,916
See you at the next meeting.
Bring with you 500 francs.

147
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,556
Hello, my little laxative.
This is baby Fritzy here.

148
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,557
He must be a genius.

149
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,434
Victor!

150
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,357
Oh, Victor!

151
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,756
<i>- Michael James, Tempest O'Brien.
- How do you do?</i>

152
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,714
- She adores me.
- He's cheating because I won last night.

153
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,436
Strip chess. She had me down to
my shorts and I fainted from tension.

154
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,710
I want a drink.

155
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,518
- Absinthe.
- Coffee.

156
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,949
Mineral water.

157
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,836
- How's Carole?
- Did you find a job?

158
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,393
I got something at the striptease.
I help the girls dress and undress.

159
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,476
- Nice job.
- 20 francs a week.

160
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,354
- Not very much.
- It's all I can afford.

161
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,268
How's Carole?

162
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,952
It's funny. When the light hits you
a certain way you're so handsome.

163
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,638
I was born in Boston city...

164
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,194
- Michael?
- Hello, pussycat.

165
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,390
Pussycat, I love you.

166
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,758
Thank you for another pot of flowers.

167
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,751
Shall I get dressed?

168
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,235
Or is it foreign-movie time?

169
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,920
Foreign-movie time.

170
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,272
You're a monster.

171
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,709
- Me? I'm not a monster.
- Yes, you are.

172
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,957
I'm your nice warm lover.

173
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,072
- What did you do today?
- Nothing. I slept.

174
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,556
Do you know that people
sleep away a third of their lives?

175
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,116
If a man lives to be 75
it means he sleeps for 25 years.

176
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,435
You know what it means
to sleep for 25 years?

177
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,950
It means you wake up
with a shocking headache.

178
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,469
Michael?
I have to have a talk with you.

179
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,512
- What about?
- Us.

180
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,870
- Us?
- Yeah.

181
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,391
That's a very touchy topic.
Because you get personal and start to hit.

182
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,592
There's no reason why
two people can't discuss marriage

183
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,756
without turning it into a Third World War!

184
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,795
We've discussed it a thousand times
and you know my view. I'm a fascist.

185
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,232
- Now, I have to go home and change.
- But, pussycat, you live upstairs!

186
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,229
I have to open your door, climb a flight
of stairs, open my door. It all takes time.

187
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,229
My parents are coming next week. They
want to know when we're getting married.

188
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,635
My mother writes every week and asks.

189
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,672
Hemingway began as a journalist
and he broke away.

190
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,193
- I want to get serious, plan a real future.
- I hoped this job would be temporary.

191
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,436
My friends are married.
They seem happy.

192
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,917
- I know there's a novel in me.
- No one's sure. It's time to decide.

193
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,919
Even if it's a bad novel.
I've got to make a start.

194
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,156
If you're not sure now, you'll never be.

195
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,670
The worst curse in the world
is to be mediocre.

196
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,588
- You're not listening to me!
- I am listening indeed!

197
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,077
Now, listen to me, pussycat.
Times are hard... and I'm in a hurry.

198
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,078
- You...!
- I have an appointment.

199
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,590
If you can't be more definite,
then we should stop seeing each other.

200
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,669
- I'm not ready for marriage.
- But how can you say you love me?

201
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,475
Because I do.

202
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,518
It wouldn't be fair to marry you now,
do you see?

203
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,192
I've got a lot of wildness and fun
to get out of my system.

204
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,754
You know, when we marry,
we give up fun.

205
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,589
- You always have an excuse.
- Ah, pussycat.

206
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,395
We're children, you and I.
Now's the time to live and experiment.

207
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,988
Marriage is for life.
It's like cement.

208
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,315
But at that rate it would drift on forever.

209
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,592
We had this conversation six months ago
and I don't see anything changed.

210
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,599
When are you old enough to assume
the responsibility of marriage? At 25?

211
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,188
26? 28? 32?

212
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,313
- 65? 89? 90? 97? 103?
- You're hysterical!

213
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,830
- Every time I don't agree I'm hysterical.
- Pull yourself together.

214
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,678
No.

215
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,312
- Give me the keys. Give me the keys.
- No, take a cab.

216
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,989
I don't wish to take a key.
I want my car cabs.

217
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,236
I need the keys... uh, the car.

218
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,430
- You've made up your horrid mind?
- Yes.

219
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,358
I shall walk!
It's better for the heart anyway. Taxi!

220
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,439
All right. But don't...
Don't say I didn't warn you.

221
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,356
Scotch.

222
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,672
Oh, excuse me.
Haven't you seen me somewhere before?

223
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,917
I know the name
but I can't remember the face.

224
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,190
<i>Oh, California sometime.</i>

225
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,278
- Give my regards to whatshername.
- Yeah.

226
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,276
Pussycat?

227
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,152
Mr James!

228
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,156
What are you, uh, doing here?

229
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,795
- I'm paid to come here.
- You're paid to come here?

230
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,799
- Yes, m-m-my magazine, you see.
- Yes, yes.

231
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,948
- And what are you doing here?
- What... am... I... doing... here?

232
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,035
Um...

233
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,675
I am here as, uh...
I'm here as a scientist, you know?

234
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,792
- Aha.
- I'm here as a scientist.

235
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,593
Plumbing the depths of the soul.

236
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,995
Doing a bit of plumbing?

237
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,509
Yes, yes. I, uh...

238
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,073
Oh!

239
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,870
- Ah!
- Oh!

240
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,677
I was so interested,
you know, in your case.

241
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,920
Intrigued me immensely, those things
that you told me about, what happens.

242
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,917
I, uh...

243
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,556
Well, I freely admit it,
I, uh, decided to follow you here.

244
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,113
If you followed me here, how did you
contrive to be here before me?

245
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,511
I followed you... very fast.

246
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,709
Ah.

247
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,150
Look, a point I've noticed, scientifically,

248
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,909
is that stripping is not sexy.

249
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,235
No, not in the slightest.

250
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,828
I can speak with a certain authority on this

251
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,795
because I've seen this show
a hundred times.

252
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,757
- You've seen this a hundred times?
- Mm.

253
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,795
Then admit it, Mr James. Admit you
come here merely searching for love.

254
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,117
- I admit it.
- Well, I'm glad you admitted it.

255
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,189
Otherwise I'd have had to lock you
in a dark closet, you naughty man.

256
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,396
Oh, that's beautiful.

257
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,471
Victor, give me a hand
with my armour, will you, please?

258
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,359
That's the back, you fool! Ooh! Oh!

259
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,833
<i>Sorry.</i>

260
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,996
Did I hurt you?

261
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,076
Yes, I am, I'm going.

262
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,159
I have tickets Saturday night
to a Lautrec exhibition.

263
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,511
Toulouse-Lautrec.
One of my favourite small men.

264
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,200
- Where's my robe?
- He's one of my favourite painters.

265
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,788
- This is the back.
- I'm sorry.

266
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,957
You would appreciate Lautrec.
He has a very sensitive line.

267
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,470
Used colour very sparingly
but made a point with line.

268
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,511
The helmet.

269
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,792
Victor, Victor, will you help me
with my veil, please?

270
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,753
Saturday night, I have tickets
to a Lautrec exhibition.

271
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,953
- He was a marvellous painter.
- I'm busy Saturday night. Hurry up.

272
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,789
- Do you like Lautrec at all?
- You've put it the wrong way around.

273
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,229
- He's short, but fun.
- Let me do it alone.

274
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,635
I'm sorry, they're all boys in my family.

275
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,551
<i>And now, the Crazy Horse
presents Mademoiselle Liz... Bien.</i>

276
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,913
Pussycat.

277
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,875
<i>Hear your name and I'd start to cry</i>

278
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,109
<i>There is just no getting over you</i>

279
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,235
<i>The girl who's in my little red book</i>

280
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,478
<i>Just never could replace your love</i>

281
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,833
<i>And each girl in my little red book
knows you're the one I'm thinkin' of</i>

282
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,873
<i>Won't you please come back to me?</i>

283
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,357
<i>Without your precious love
I can't go on</i>

284
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,233
<i>Where can you be?</i>

285
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,396
<i>I need you so much</i>

286
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,114
<i>All I do is to talk about you</i>

287
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,834
<i>Hear your name and I start to cry</i>

288
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,396
<i>There is just no getting over you</i>

289
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,357
<i>Oh-oh-oh</i>

290
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,076
<i>Won't you please come back to me?</i>

291
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,238
<i>Without your precious love
I can't go on</i>

292
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,557
<i>Where can you be?</i>

293
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,352
<i>I need you so much</i>

294
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,074
<i>All I do is to talk about you</i>

295
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,760
<i>Hear your name and I start to cry</i>

296
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,000
<i>There is just no getting over you</i>

297
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,714
<i>All I do is to talk about you</i>

298
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,400
<i>Hear your name and I start to cry...</i>

299
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,389
Ah!

300
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,674
You're working here? There's something
exciting about a place like this after hours.

301
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,429
The empty seats
and the smell of greasepaint.

302
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,759
- What is that?
- I dunno. Probably just a short.

303
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,030
<i>What is it?</i>

304
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,277
I don't know, but I don't want
to be here when it gets hungry.

305
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,278
- Victor, I'm scared.
- Don't panic, it may be nothing.

306
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,949
- You can panic now.
- Let's get out of here, quick.

307
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,193
My wife, I'll kill her!
I'll kill my wife!

308
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,834
Pardon me, drunk,
but you can't come in here.

309
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,715
She makes a fool of me,
she makes a fool... I kill her! I kill him!

310
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,599
Why don't you go home and sleep it off?

311
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,950
She cheats with him.

312
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,991
I kill him! I kill him!

313
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,475
- But who is he?
- Everybody!

314
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,673
She cheats with everybody!
I kill everybody! Everybody... everybody.

315
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,472
Poor man.

316
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,751
Why does everyone have
so much trouble with being in love?

317
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,432
It never seems to work. You love me
and I love... I love Michael and...

318
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,709
Oh, Victor, I'm so mixed up.

319
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,550
I feel... marvellous

320
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,955
I feel... marvellous...

321
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,275
- I adore the way you dance.
- And I adore the way you look tonight.

322
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,596
- I've only got vodka.
- Oh, vodka. Vodka's fine.

323
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,915
When it comes to liquor, I'm a health nut.

324
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,989
I drink a lot of gin and wheat germ.
Regular vodka and gluten.

325
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,840
- Please don't.
- Why not?

326
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,236
- You came here to hear my poems.
- I did?

327
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,388
Oh, I did! Yes, surely.
But you've been so affectionate, pussycat.

328
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,153
- You're on my foot!
- Oh, I beg your pardon.

329
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,317
- It's all right.
- But I want to hear your poems.

330
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,635
Oh, all right. But behave.

331
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,877
Yes, sure. I love erotic poems.

332
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,355
Oh, it's not erotic, it's political.

333
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,436
- Is it?
- Mm-hm.

334
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,389
Oh, yeah.

335
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,638
I wrote this at Hillside Hospital,
just after my fourth nervous breakdown.

336
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,194
<i>Two, three, four.</i>

337
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,788
"Who killed Charlie Parker?"

338
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,400
"You did. You... rat."

339
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,956
I dedicate this next poem...

340
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640
Well, it's been an interesting evening...

341
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,877
Please... don't go.

342
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,274
No?

343
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,030
I'm beginning to grow
extremely fond of you.

344
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,958
I get attached to people very quickly.

345
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,550
I'm a woman who can experience things
really deeply for the first time.

346
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,399
Well, I don't fall in love easily either.

347
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,911
I believe in adventure
and experimentation and no attachments.

348
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,157
- Oh, I love that in a man.
- Ah. Well...

349
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,230
I'm one for marriage, though. But I believe
only after two people have lived together...

350
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,317
Intimacy before final involvement.

351
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,113
Yes, how true. How true.

352
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,277
Why are we reading all the poems?
I know a poem too.

353
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,435
Mm?

354
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,710
"Had we but world enough, and time,

355
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,879
This coyness, Lady, were no crime."

356
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,194
Ah.

357
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,914
One more poem...

358
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,998
and you can do with me what you want.

359
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,238
- Victor, can I have a drink?
- Sure, what would you like?

360
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,195
A triple Scotch on the rocks.
Sometimes a drink will loosen me up.

361
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,714
- You have got something to eat?
- Some, uh, some Fig Newtons.

362
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,072
And some Hershey bars
and... some cough drops.

363
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,189
- You got any tuna fish?
- Tuna fish... tuna fish...

364
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,077
Uh...

365
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,478
I have...
I have some salmon salad left.

366
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,114
What do you mean, "left"?
When did you make it?

367
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,913
In April, but if you smother it
with pepper it's fine.

368
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,998
- What about an egg?
- An egg... Wait.

369
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,036
Uh, yes, I have...

370
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,271
Oh!

371
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,709
You look... you look beautiful.

372
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,400
I'm beginning to feel warm already.

373
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,516
Thank you.

374
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,551
Mm. Mm.

375
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,840
Gee, I need a cigarette.

376
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,435
I think there's something sexy about
the way some men smoke cigarettes.

377
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,635
Oh! I just burnt my finger.

378
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,312
I'm going to go in the bathroom
and scream. I'll be out in a minute.

379
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,996
My finger!

380
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,111
- Victor!
- Forgive me, I...

381
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,959
I saw your lips standing there.

382
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,039
Why don't I go into the bedroom?
I wait for you in bed.

383
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,237
<i>Here I am</i>

384
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,113
<i>Here I stay</i>

385
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,070
<i>All of my life I'll be what you</i>

386
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,034
<i>Want me to be</i>

387
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,752
<i>All that I ask</i>

388
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,633
<i>Is that you just keep loving me</i>

389
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,194
Here I come, dear.

390
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,430
I'm all shaven.

391
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,994
Everything's off.

392
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,035
I'm here. Uh... I'm up here.

393
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,550
Dear? Uh, fragrance?

394
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,230
Dear, are you OK? Is it...?
I'm going to get into the bed now.

395
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,477
Dear! Come on, dear.
Let's go! Here I am!

396
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,476
Um...

397
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,555
What?

398
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,477
Sweetheart?

399
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,033
Here...

400
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,991
Carole?

401
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,678
Um...

402
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,517
Are... are you asleep?

403
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,916
You're crumpled on the floor, right?

404
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,115
All right. Good night!

405
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,235
Listen, we're strangers, fella.
Take it easy.

406
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,353
Take...? I was sitting there quietly
and you jumped on top...

407
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,268
- How'd you like my poems?
- They're very beautiful and quite moving.

408
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,554
<i>Did you like the one about peaceful
coexistence, Ode To A Pacifist Junkie?</i>

409
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,911
- Yes. I thought it was very sexy.
- Oh.

410
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,192
Actually, the poem wasn't about sex,
it was a plea for better housing.

411
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,276
Now, look...

412
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,669
I've got a sexual block.
It's a thing with me.

413
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,189
I don't wish to cause you any conflict.

414
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,519
No, no, you're perfectly right.
I must face up to the problem.

415
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,837
I can't go on the rest of my life
being a semi-virgin.

416
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,636
What, in the name of all that's gracious,
is a semi-virgin?

417
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,149
Here, I'm a virgin.
In America, I'm not.

418
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,636
What do they do?
Stamp it on your passport?

419
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,434
- Now, listen to me.
- Uh-oh.

420
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,835
I feel faint.
Excuse me for a minute.

421
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,078
I'm going into the bathroom
to take an overdose of sleeping pills.

422
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,672
I like you.
You're a nice, stable girl.

423
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,920
She'll be all right.
There's nothing to worry about.

424
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,352
I thought she was joking. It was all poems
and "Don't touch me". She's weird.

425
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,473
They're only phenobarbital.
She only had a couple.

426
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,989
She came out of the bathroom
and looked very odd

427
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,749
and I gave her a little...
nibble on the neck.

428
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,314
Like that, you see?
Then she fell on the floor.

429
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,396
- A nibble?
- A nibble.

430
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,675
- How are you?
- Sorry about that. I got panicky.

431
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,708
Mademoiselle Belmont
will stay overnight, OK?

432
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,877
Oh, surely. Have a good night's pill.

433
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,156
Pussycat?

434
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,116
Pussycat?

435
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,716
Carole?

436
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,996
Miss Werner!

437
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,316
Carole!

438
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,117
Please repeat after me.
"The pen is blue."

439
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,231
<i>The pen is blue.</i>

440
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,835
I go, she goes, we go, they go.

441
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,873
<i>I go, she goes, we go, they go.</i>

442
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,798
Where were you last night?
That's all I want to know!

443
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,311
- I told you not to visit when I'm at work.
- You didn't sleep in your room!

444
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,432
Unless you're ready to get serious,
it's not your business.

445
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,630
All right, we disagree.
Let's discuss it.

446
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,957
<i>- There is nothing to discuss!
- There is nothing to discuss.</i>

447
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,198
<i>- There is plenty to discuss.
- There is plenty to discuss.</i>

448
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,073
I am serious and you are not.
Don't feel obligated.

449
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,988
<i>- I love you, pussycat!
- I love you, pussycat.</i>

450
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,317
You've got a funny idea of love.
How do you treat people you hate?

451
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,796
- It's different for a girl.
- It is not! It is not different!

452
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,876
If you can run around, so can I.

453
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,309
<i>- You love me!
- You love me.</i>

454
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,908
I am tired of waiting.
I've got my own life to live.

455
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,828
Oh, yes? OK, OK, you'll be sorry.
You'll be sorry.

456
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,916
<i>- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!</i>

457
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,998
- You'll see, you'll be sorry.
- Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!

458
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,916
<i>Goodbye!</i>

459
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,759
All right!
Sleep where you want, see if I care.

460
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,429
<i>- I sure as hell will!
- I sure as hell will!</i>

461
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,791
Oh! You bunch of parrots!

462
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,675
Life is a strumpet

463
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,394
stained with wine.

464
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,956
"Go to, I'll no more on't;
it hath made me mad."

465
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,596
"I say, we will have
no more marriages!"

466
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,075
Isn't that Schiller?

467
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,953
- Shakespeare.
- Mm?

468
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,396
That man there

469
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,399
is the finest man that ever breathed.

470
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,795
- Who is?
- He is.

471
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,354
He is? Who's he?

472
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,992
- Who's he?
- Mm.

473
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,998
I'll soon show you who he is.

474
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,715
Hey! You must not strike me,
you naughty boy!

475
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,276
You're my patient, that's who you are!

476
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:53,919
And, anyway, I can lick any Freudian
psychoanalyst that's in this house.

477
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,032
An analyst? Then I need help.

478
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,755
<i>- Encore, la meme chose.
- And for me, please.</i>

479
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,518
Carole. Carole.

480
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,710
I love her. She's beautiful.

481
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,551
She wasn't in her apartment and I've tried
everything you said and it doesn't work.

482
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,477
- Liz.
- Mm, Liz?

483
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,275
She's a stripper. She's beautiful.

484
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,313
And she's here on a bongo scholarship.

485
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,510
Why don't you introduce me to her?

486
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,235
I could be the man that sees
no one touches her for you.

487
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,148
No, no, no. I need help. Help.

488
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,750
Don't mention that word to me - "help".

489
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,474
<i>That is what I need. Help!</i>

490
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,956
Oh, God, how I need that thing.

491
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,277
Do you know that
I am in love with a patient?

492
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,756
I am in love with a patient!
You got a minute?

493
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,792
- Surely.
- Let me tell you my story.

494
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,876
Let me sit down.

495
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,073
Carole is like a rose petal.

496
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,191
She's so innocent.

497
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,518
Can I tell you what happened
in my dream last night?

498
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,792
I shall sell matches
on the street corner.

499
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,313
And I shall be
the first to buy them from you.

500
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,396
Very civil.

501
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,995
Miss Lefebvre.

502
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,156
Miss Lefebvre!

503
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,636
Every time she sees me she screams

504
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,718
because every time
she sees me I attack her.

505
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,391
No. You must not attack her.

506
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,080
You must woo her.

507
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,030
- Woo her?
- Woo her.

508
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,358
Woo her...

509
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,916
In Vienna.

510
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,592
You must stand underneath her window.
And I shall pretend to be you.

511
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,314
And I shall pour your heart out.

512
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,514
Oh!

513
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,030
We shall halloo her name

514
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,833
to the reverberant hills.

515
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,632
Lefebvre!

516
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,348
Lefebvre!

517
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,231
You are, without doubt,

518
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,638
one of the finest men
what ever breathed.

519
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,311
Who is?

520
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,959
Who is?

521
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,117
I'll soon show you...

522
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,196
who is.

523
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,828
Dear old pals

524
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,875
Jolly old pals

525
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,549
Always together

526
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,390
In all kinds of weather

527
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,989
<i>Eins, zwei, drei.</i>

528
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,159
That's the one.
The third one, up there. That one.

529
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,431
We must attract her attention.

530
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,468
Direct hit!

531
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,830
Who's there?

532
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,431
"But, soft! What light from
yonder window breaks?"

533
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,078
Psst! "My darling, your face
is like the pale autumn moon."

534
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,397
- You're joking?
- I'm not joking.

535
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,398
- I can't say that!
- Why can't you say that?

536
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,512
- It's ghastly!
- Did someone call me?

537
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:40,034
I did! Your Apollo, god of the sun,
is calling his aphrodisiac.

538
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,879
- I'm going to be sick.
- But who's there?

539
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,879
My darling, your face
is like the pale autumn moon.

540
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,673
My face is what? Now, who are you?

541
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,589
- Help me. I love that woman!
- No wonder she thinks you're such a twit.

542
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,358
Who are you?

543
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,836
<i>Not addressing you, sir.
Would you kindly leave the étage?</i>

544
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,318
My darling, your face is like
the pale autumn moon. Your face...

545
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,273
- Thank you!
- What did you say my face was?

546
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,315
Your face is like the pale autumn moon!
Are you deaf?

547
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,149
Don't speak to her
like what you done, you rude man.

548
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,840
Give her the nice things!

549
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,637
What's going on there?

550
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,548
- He's saying your face is like the moon.
- My face?

551
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,232
Not your face, you idiot. The face
on the lady what's in the top tower!

552
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,272
Will you shut up?
Come back to bed!

553
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,995
Listen, whoever you are,
you are dull and I'm going in.

554
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,351
<i>- She's going in! Quick!
- We can't get any sleep!</i>

555
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,040
Will you please shut up and go away!

556
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,833
- Go home!
- And you, too! Shut up!

557
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,517
Right! Everybody, inside!

558
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,473
Trickle back to your truckle beds.

559
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,433
<i>Everybody, faites vos jeux.</i>

560
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,630
Ooh! Ah!

561
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,479
Give her something romantic!
Say romantic things to her!

562
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,997
Your name... is like a bell
that hangs in my heart.

563
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,272
May it ring... and swing.

564
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,558
Lefebvre!

565
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,235
Lefebvre!

566
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:31,156
Miss Lefebvre! Miss Lefebvre!
It's me, baby Fritz, and I love you!

567
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,958
Police!

568
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,638
Help, help!

569
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,115
Police!

570
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,395
And now, group, whose emotional
problems shall we discuss today?

571
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,954
- Me, me, me, me.
- No, mine. Mine. Mine.

572
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,956
Me, me, me, me!

573
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,710
I've been coming here ten months and
we haven't discussed my problem once.

574
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,230
Perhaps if you'd be kind enough
to tell us what your problem is

575
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,193
then we could all have a go
at discussing it or something.

576
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,039
I can't. It's dirty.

577
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,993
Weren't we discussing, last week,

578
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,793
Mr Durrell's relationship with his father?

579
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,311
Actually, we were discussing the dream
about the train entering the tunnel.

580
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,876
<i>Oh,ja, ja. The train in the tunnel.
That was a good one.</i>

581
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,714
By the way, ladies and gentlemen, we
have with us a new member of our group.

582
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,355
He's a young man who has got
certain emotional problems.

583
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,155
All your life you should have such
problems as this young man has got.

584
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,794
He's the editor
of a well-known fashion magazine.

585
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,038
I'm referring to
none other than Mr Michael James.

586
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,115
<i>Ahem.</i>

587
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,800
I haven't been sleeping very well

588
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,311
and if I... if I go without it
I find that, um, quite often,

589
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,829
I, um, fall asleep.

590
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,235
Carole is my girlfriend.
She's part of the whole... perishing thing.

591
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,831
She, um, lies... puts me on the bed.
She... on the bed...

592
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,349
and sometimes she misses
and I go under the bed,

593
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,758
but this is what we describe
as a pot shot and it doesn't count.

594
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,555
Argh! Argh!

595
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,558
<i>- Argh! Argh!
- Quills!</i>

596
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,992
Control your knees immediately
or they'll be shaved within the hour.

597
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,631
Mr Quills! Have you no shame?

598
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,709
Why do you keep attacking new members
in this way, you great fat Moby Dick?

599
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,038
When it's springtime in Vienna

600
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,674
Quills is a paranoiac.
He sleeps with the light on.

601
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,279
- Pansy!
- Nail biter!

602
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,676
- I prefer the sickness to the cure.
- Early days, Mr James.

603
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,588
- Didn't you mention a dark closet?
- Good idea. I've got one over here.

604
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,473
<i>Goody, another free-for-all!</i>

605
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,558
It's a raid! Run for your lives!

606
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,079
Miss Lefebvre. You look
positively ravishing in that face.

607
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,113
Thank you, Herr Professor.
Group, listen.

608
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,279
I've some marvellous fresh
emotional experiences to tell you about.

609
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,675
You see, the other day...

610
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,234
He told me any time I had trouble
controlling myself to blow this.

611
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,989
You have... trouble controlling yourself?

612
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,917
Only with men. I have an intense need
to be loved by many men many times.

613
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,996
Really?

614
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,998
- A little wine, would you care for?
- Yes.

615
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,509
You'd never know by your placid exterior

616
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,428
that underneath that ice-cold facade
beats the heart of a savage...

617
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,438
lustful... passionate animal.

618
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,075
What will you have
for breakfast tomorrow?

619
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,714
Orange juice, tea and toast.

620
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,514
I have to call someone
and tell them I will not be home tonight.

621
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,872
The phone's down by the bed,
next to my prayer shawl.

622
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,394
Agh!

623
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,080
- I'm sorry about the fight.
- What?

624
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,317
- I decided you were right.
- What, what, what, what?

625
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,194
- About some things.
- What... what did you decide?

626
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,788
- I'm moving in with you.
- You're moving in?

627
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,992
Yes. What the hell's the matter with you?

628
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,350
You now... moving in?
You... in... moving?

629
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,552
Yes, yes.
I am sick of wasting any more time.

630
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,274
You're now moving in...?
You... you've decided...?

631
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,155
Yes. Darling, listen. If we were
living together like husband and wife

632
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,158
maybe you'd see
it wasn't all horrible after all.

633
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,477
- Oh, but it is. It's horrible.
- Michael!

634
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:30,755
Go downstairs, pussycat, and I'll join you
in a while and we'll have a nice fight.

635
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,758
You don't want me here for a reason.
You're covering up.

636
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,235
I want the moment to be right!

637
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,833
- I want it to be a special occasion.
- Oh, well...

638
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,396
Listen to me. You said your mother
and father are coming next week.

639
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,751
Do you want us to celebrate
us two living out of wedlock?

640
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,830
- I don't think they'd appreciate it.
- Well, look, let's discuss it later.

641
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,597
Something's wrong... someplace.

642
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,069
Well, look what's sleeping in your bed.

643
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,271
As a man's life goes down the drain,
you are there.

644
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,319
Oh dear, all this work I've got to do.

645
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,149
Wash the dishes,
polish the furniture, do this, do that.

646
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,919
I say, I do earn my pay.

647
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,670
Here we go, cock, spotless we must be.

648
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,273
<i>Ah.</i>

649
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,915
Uh, pussycat. I can please explain.

650
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,510
Michael! I had to see you.

651
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,872
You haven't called me
since that last fantastic night.

652
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,639
You hyperthyroid.

653
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,672
Carole! Look, I love you!
I love you, Carole!

654
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,236
It's not what it seems!
I'm opening up a seminary!

655
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,709
Begging your pardon,
I'm going to find the john.

656
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,952
Mm. Ah!

657
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,355
There it is, fine. Good.

658
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,156
Oh, my...

659
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,956
Another overdose...

660
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,036
Um... Um...

661
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,638
Uh, hello, help? Succour?
Um, emergency ward, yes.

662
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,911
<i>My name is Michael James.
Je suis Michael James.</i>

663
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,636
<i>There is an étrange... uh...
bird ici... Uh... she...</i>

664
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,352
- Ooh!
- Oh!

665
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,076
Just relax. That's fine.

666
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,997
Take it easy, now.

667
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,792
I'm sorry.

668
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,478
May I ask what is your relationship
to this girl? Are you her fiancé?

669
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,433
No, I'm just a friend.

670
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,109
It's a pretty rocky friendship you've got.

671
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,356
Pussycat?

672
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,956
Pussycat?

673
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,195
Do you think you could love a short man?
I mean, if he had very attractive red hair?

674
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,709
Victor, I adore you.

675
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,319
<i>Collected Poems of Shelley.
I always wanted to read...</i>

676
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,797
- Sorry, I saw Shelley first.
- You did not! I saw it first!

677
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,354
Like hell you did. It's mine.

678
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,234
Victor! You're not going
to let him take that book?

679
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,793
- Actually, she did see the book first.
- Beat it.

680
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,115
Oh! Victor.

681
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,834
Thrash him. Come on. Go!

682
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,716
What is...? Go on!

683
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,479
Uh...

684
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,556
I have a bad head cold...

685
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,879
Victor, you always said
you'd go through hell for me. Go on!

686
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,036
You see his knuckles? They're huge!

687
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,958
You're not going to
let that man insult your woman?

688
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:41,029
You're Michael's woman. Why don't I
get him? He could be here in five minutes.

689
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,312
If you have any hopes for winning me,
now is the moment to prove it. Go on.

690
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,396
Go on! Go on!

691
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,391
Come on, Victor!

692
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,829
Kick him! Kick him!

693
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,394
- Give it...!
- Hand me that book.

694
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,830
- No.
- Give me that book.

695
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,076
Go on! Victor!

696
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,432
Victor, show him! Kick him now!

697
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,438
- Will you give me that book?
- No! You are not a gentleman.

698
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,438
- I am a gentleman!
- No, you are not.

699
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,517
Victor, show him!
Get him! Kick him! Hit him!

700
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,111
Victor, you're so brave, I'm shocked.

701
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,549
Victor...

702
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,319
I must have Carole.

703
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,000
I need her. I love her.

704
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,032
She's the whole world to me,
and she's mine.

705
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,598
The only way anyone could take
her away from me... is by killing me.

706
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,029
I've decided what I'm going to do.

707
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,038
I've been seeing the best
psychoanalyst in Paris.

708
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,393
He's a genius. And he wants me
to go to his group analysis courses.

709
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,789
Well, I've been going. I'm going to
keep on going. And I'm going to fight!

710
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,071
And I'm going to win... because I love her.

711
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:21,231
Ah, that's better. Ah, a little gentle steam.
Does one the world of good.

712
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,949
Ahh.

713
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,231
We must have physical health
as well as mental health.

714
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,873
Oh, I'm kinky for steam.

715
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,278
I was born in Boston city, boys

716
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,868
The place you all know well

717
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,275
<i>Are you well, Victor?</i>

718
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:45,032
Brought up by honest parents
and the truth to you I'll tell

719
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,073
<i>Brought up by honest parents...</i>

720
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,316
<i>Let me outta here!</i>

721
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,869
<i>I can't open it!</i>

722
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,633
Then, Doctor, when I was 15 years old, I
had to tell my parents they were adopted.

723
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,832
We fought,
I stopped coming home and moved out.

724
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,750
So you turned promiscuous?
Well, I love that in a woman. Love it.

725
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,713
<i>I can't help it,
I'm a physical woman.</i>

726
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,994
I feel guilty about it but I come from
a family of acute nymphomaniacs.

727
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,554
That includes my father
and my two brothers.

728
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,830
Why don't we all undress?
It's so modern...

729
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,679
For instance, Doctor...

730
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,559
I find myself extremely
attracted... to Mr James.

731
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:36,312
And the fact that he's in love with
someone else excites me even more.

732
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,352
What is it that you see in him
that you don't see in me?

733
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,995
I don't know.
But there is something about his face.

734
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,834
When the light hits him a certain way,
he's almost handsome.

735
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,430
You're lovely but I'm here to get rid
of problems, not to acquire them.

736
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,315
Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
who is the handsomest of them all?

737
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,192
<i>- I am.
- I am!</i>

738
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,356
I am!

739
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,070
Group, in Britain
we have a national therapy.

740
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,031
We call it...

741
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,832
cricket.

742
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:14,796
Unlike other sports, there's no anxiety
or pressure. It's leisurely and lyrical.

743
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,959
It's the song of willow on leather.

744
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,830
- Is there any sex in it?
- Oh, no.

745
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,238
This is a game for gentlemen,
played by gentlemen.

746
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,316
It's sick. Sick!

747
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,872
Miss Lefebvre,
tell me something about yourself.

748
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,915
He's really elegant, isn't he?
Do something for me, Doctor.

749
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,436
Couldn't you throw those girls away?
I don't like those girls around him.

750
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,596
Lay here and watch your...

751
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:54,840
watch your champion
from a good... here... vantage point.

752
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,599
There, now, on my shoulder.
Can you see him better?

753
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:03,590
Can't you feel him better? Feel all those
lovely... ooh... strokes he's pulling?

754
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,957
- Couldn't you arrange something for me?
- What would you like?

755
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,469
To have a session, just the three of us.

756
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,910
A little bowling and a little batting?
Something like that?

757
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,474
No, a more intimate game, you know?

758
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,831
I mean, when are they going to finish?
I'm getting very nervous.

759
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,758
Isn't this game scintillating and exciting?

760
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,270
I'd like the game to be over.
I'd like to play something else.

761
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,676
Other games?
Well, that's interesting, too.

762
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,959
Can you see the bowler? Don't look at
the batsman, the bowler's interesting.

763
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,436
- I love the batsman better.
- Yeah, batsmen are all right.

764
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,030
I always have liked
a little bit of bowler, myself.

765
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,668
...Raised most tenderly

766
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,712
Till I became a sporting blade...

767
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,479
- I thought you'd never get here.
- What the hell...?

768
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,673
- I've been waiting for you to telephone.
- What are you doing here?

769
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,873
I've been thinking about what you said,
and I think you're right.

770
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,630
The only way two people can really get
to know one another is by living together.

771
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,795
- Oh... What?
- Mm-hm.

772
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,435
- So I'm moving in here.
- You're moving in here?

773
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,112
Ah!

774
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,357
You've taken leave of your senses!
You're a weird lady!

775
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,677
Even though we've known each other
for such a few hours,

776
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,397
I feel that we were meant for one another.
Do you believe in kismet?

777
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,397
Please, go home.

778
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,317
I'm hungry.

779
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,000
Don't you just love sin?

780
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,075
Just a bloody minute. Sit down.

781
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,112
- Sit down. Sit!
- Sit. Fine.

782
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,915
Now, you and I are going to have
a little talk, get things straightened out.

783
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,875
- God, I love it when you're domineering.
- Really? Oh.

784
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,073
Now, while I think
that you're a smashing young lady,

785
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,397
I am not in love with you,
do you understand?

786
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,080
I am not in love with you.

787
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,752
<i>- She's been upset lately.
- I'm so sorry.</i>

788
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,792
Mademoiselle, the boys
of emergency suicide ward

789
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,196
voted you this gold watch
for unusual devotion.

790
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,799
Oh...

791
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,876
Thank you.

792
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,234
<i>What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-o-o</i>

793
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,631
<i>What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-o-o</i>

794
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,638
Michael, remember me?
You loved me in your office.

795
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,716
Indeed I do.

796
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,595
Remember the night in the hospital bed?

797
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,790
Unforgettable.

798
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,071
- My mother's crypt.
- Oh, poor mummy.

799
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,796
On top of the Eiffel Tower.

800
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,876
Very chilly.

801
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,356
<i>You could have had me, Michael.</i>

802
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:18,160
Michael, I need you. I've telephoned you
several times. Why haven't you called?

803
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,158
I've phoned you I don't know
how many times, maybe six.

804
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,716
I know it's neurotic,
but I want you, Michael.

805
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,751
- Michael.
- Michael.

806
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,070
- Michael.
- Michael.

807
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,112
Excuse me, I...
Oh! Hello, there.

808
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,834
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

809
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,997
Michael, I've tried
to telephone you for several...

810
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,714
- Michael. I've tried to teleph...
- Michael?

811
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,593
- Michael!
- Michael!

812
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,350
Right! I want all you cats to shape up!

813
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,751
"But I, that am not shap'd
for sportive tricks,

814
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,189
Nor made to court
an amorous looking glass;

815
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,150
<i>I, that am rudely stamp'd,
and want love's majesty to strut..."</i>

816
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,592
"Why, I, in this weak piping
time of peace..."

817
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,829
Dr Fassbender!

818
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,272
"Can I do all this,
and yet cannot get a crown?"

819
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,632
"Tut! were it further off,
I'll pluck it down."

820
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,514
Dr Fassbender!
Dr Fassbender! Dr Fassbender.

821
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,515
I must see Dr Fassbender immediately.

822
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,916
It's not possible. He's in with a patient.
I daren't disturb him.

823
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:41,512
Couldn't you make an exception in this
one instance? It's very important to me.

824
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:46,794
Well, in this case,
I think maybe it's possible. He's in there.

825
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,470
Hello. Good morning.

826
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,034
- Michael James!
- Can't you knock?

827
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,596
- Knock? I'm in dire need!
- So am I! What do you think I am, human?

828
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:04,670
Bring it up at the next group analysis
meeting, something like that. Not now!

829
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,830
I hope you don't get the wrong idea
about what happened just now.

830
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,839
Not at all. It was quite simple.
You attacked me.

831
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,512
Well, if you feel like that about it
you may as well have your whistle back.

832
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:24,237
Thank God you came when you did. He
was talking. Next thing you know - bang!

833
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,433
Just because I speak frankly about my
problems doesn't mean I'm a pushover.

834
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,629
No.

835
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,957
There is more to love
than just physical excitement.

836
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,436
- Respect, for instance, is very important.
- Oh, very important.

837
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,951
Don't think I don't appreciate those things.
Like finesse, atmosphere...

838
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,035
Atmosphere.

839
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,754
- You agree it is important?
- Very important.

840
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,635
Two people in a romantic setting,
soft light, music, champagne.

841
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,435
- Perhaps even incense burning.
- Oh, incense is beautiful.

842
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,199
This is all very important to me.

843
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,072
Only then can I give myself.

844
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,156
But not before.

845
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,991
<i>Who would have
ever thought... in an elevator?</i>

846
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,350
<i>It's the safest place in the world,</i>

847
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,191
provided the combined weight of the
two people does not exceed 1400 pounds.

848
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,277
It was hell, but we'll be fine.

849
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,758
Thank you, we'll be fine.
Very kind. We'll be absolutely fine.

850
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,274
<i>Ah.</i>

851
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,868
<i>Come away with me
for the weekend.</i>

852
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,275
- Where?
- Chateau Chantelle.

853
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,758
Oh, how lovely. We could fish
and hunt and ride and swim and...

854
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,314
And all in my room.

855
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,836
<i>Here I stay...</i>

856
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:25,352
<i>I'll be what you want me to be</i>

857
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:32,350
<i>All that I ask is that
you just keep loving me</i>

858
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,109
Michael! Carole wasn't in
so we thought we would try here.

859
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,028
- O-o-oh, Mr and Mrs Werner.
- Didn't Carole tell you we were coming?

860
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,711
O-oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Marole mumming... C-Carole coming.

861
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,796
Call me Mother.

862
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,879
Miss Lefebvre!
I can stand it no longer!

863
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,595
For the love of you, I die.

864
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,870
<i>Ah!</i>

865
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,789
- Do you have any salt?
- What was that you said?

866
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,832
- Do you have any salt?
- Have I got any salt?

867
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,319
I got a boat, I got kerosene,
matches, firecrackers,

868
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,718
<i>two swords und this flag,
but I ain't got no salt!</i>

869
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,993
- Do you always eat here?
- Once a year. On my birthday.

870
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,793
- Your birthday tonight, huh?
- Yeah, I'm 29 today.

871
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,672
29?

872
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,313
What a night I should pick. Look.

873
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,718
I've got something I wish to do in private
without people looking. Would you mind?

874
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,276
Go ahead. I'm just gonna sit here,
grab a bite, and run.

875
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,678
I can't go ahead while you're hanging
round eating food, you naughty thing.

876
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,396
- Just do whatever you have to do.
- You're a selfish gourmet.

877
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,479
What are you doing over there?

878
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,751
What is that? What's that? A flare?

879
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:52,872
What are you doing here?
What's going on? What's going on here?

880
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,074
Why don't you shut up, you cretin?
I'm trying to commit suicide.

881
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,871
Set fire to my beautiful
psychoanalyst body

882
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,231
<i>und sail out to sea, ablaze like a Viking!</i>

883
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,509
- You're a doctor?
- I'm a doctor of the mind.

884
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,475
Really? I have terrible emotional
problems. Could you help me?

885
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:17,354
You certainly picked a very odd time
to ask, just in the middle of a suicide.

886
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,870
All right. But you'll have to lay down
cos I can't do it standing up.

887
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,356
- Lay down? This is a rented tuxedo.
- I don't care what it is. Lay down.

888
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,996
I can't do it standing up. Get in there.
Lay right flat out in the boat.

889
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,795
There's Carole.

890
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,356
- Hello.
- Ah, it's Mr Overactive Glands.

891
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,232
- Listen...
- Get off me.

892
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,353
I have got my own life to lead, and I
told you I never wanted to see you again.

893
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,870
Stay in your own apartment and lead
your own life and let me live mine!

894
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,468
Darling! Guess who's here?
Mother and Father!

895
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,957
Mother! Dad! When did you get here?

896
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,073
The roads were clear, we got in a little
early. Michael has been entertaining us.

897
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:06,478
- Yes, yes, he's a marvellous host. I just...
- Let's not go into that now.

898
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,036
Let's go out. The night's young,
your parents have to leave tomorrow.

899
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,914
Yes, let's celebrate.
I adore this city, it's magnificent.

900
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,717
I don't remember when you two
said you were going to get married.

901
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,195
- We didn't give you a date, Mama.
- Oh.

902
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,630
I could've sworn you wrote
it will be next month.

903
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,957
- Didn't she write that?
- I didn't remember any date.

904
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:53,913
We really are taking steps
to facilitate proceedings

905
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,315
in a mature and deliberate way.

906
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,228
- Did you get a blood test?
- When we are ready we'll let you know.

907
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,829
I'm in love with a girl and she doesn't
love me, she loves some other guy.

908
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,078
- And I'm just in the way.
- Oh. Oh, I see. Yes, yes.

909
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,397
What do you think I ought to do?

910
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,354
- Well, why don't you buy a sports car?
- A sports car?

911
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:31,871
Yeah, a nice little two-seater. French,
German, Italian thing. Goes "vroom".

912
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,231
You know, they love it.
Sign of man's virility.

913
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,989
- Perhaps you ought to get two, maybe.
- I can't drive.

914
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,395
Ah, well, you knock a few people down.

915
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,432
The main thing is you get the girl.
That's all that matters.

916
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,438
You know, for a doctor,
you sound terribly unethical.

917
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,755
Unethical?

918
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,111
What do I give a damn about ethics? Huh?

919
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,869
My father, the most beloved
gynaecologist in Vienna,

920
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,232
as they took him away for indecent
exposure at the State Opera House,

921
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,316
said, and I quote:

922
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,513
"Please do not take me away,
I will not do it again."

923
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:10,552
- Brilliant quote.
- He was a brilliant pervert.

924
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,399
- Listen, it's my birthday.
- You told me that.

925
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,193
- Can we get back to it?
- What about my funeral?

926
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,073
Let's do your funeral first,
then my birthday.

927
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,509
It's a bargain.
You any good at wrapping?

928
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,108
Yeah, I used to work
at a department store. Why?

929
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:28,756
Maybe you could help me
get wrapped up in that flag there.

930
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,989
- Grab one end.
- You know how to do this?

931
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,953
It's a cinch. I used to wrap packages.

932
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,868
- All right. Wait a minute, wait a second.
- Got it? Try and get it now.

933
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,514
Go ahead. All right?

934
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,437
<i>- No, no, no.
- Hm.</i>

935
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,994
<i>- Again.
- Uh...</i>

936
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,554
I don't want to be a Viking.

937
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,797
- Why don't we get something to eat?
- Good idea.

938
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,515
Are you upset cos you're a sissy?
A haircut, a gym, you'll be great.

939
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,198
Nothing to do with the haircut!

940
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,915
<i>We've had a wonderful time!
We'll go to our hotel and get some sleep.</i>

941
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,634
<i>- Bye, Daddy!
- Thank you for everything.</i>

942
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,432
- Bye, Mama.
- Goodbye.

943
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,949
<i>- Come on, Mother.
- Thank you.</i>

944
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,594
<i>We're leaving noon tomorrow. Today!</i>

945
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,759
<i>- Remember, you will get married.
- Yes. Goodbye, Mother.</i>

946
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:28,158
<i>We are going away for
the weekend. Our second honeymoon!</i>

947
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,635
<i>Drive carefully.</i>

948
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,113
Bye.

949
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,834
<i>- Goodbye, now.
- Goodbye!</i>

950
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,552
Goodbye.

951
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,593
Bye.

952
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,918
- Tonight was fun.
- Yes.

953
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:13,316
I haven't felt so relaxed for a long time.

954
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,714
- You were marvellous with my parents.
- Oh, I like them.

955
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,234
- They adore you.
- Really?

956
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,152
Well...

957
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,637
It was nice seeing you again.

958
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,716
- Carole...
- Yes?

959
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,156
Let's get married.

960
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:54,596
- You are... drunk.
- No, I'm sober.

961
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:58,793
I mean it. Let's get married.

962
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,673
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

963
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:07,637
I can't tell you anything
but, suddenly, I'm sure.

964
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:13,152
- Suddenly you're sure?
- Suddenly I'm very sure.

965
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,236
Will you marry me?

966
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,199
- Like when?
- This week?

967
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,311
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...?

968
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,954
Oh, you want me to pick a date?

969
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,076
I adore you.

970
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,669
I'm positive. Certain.

971
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,156
I want you

972
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,431
more than anything in the world,

973
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,118
pussycat.

974
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,872
Pussycat.

975
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,996
How about Monday?

976
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,394
Monday.

977
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,238
Absolutely!

978
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,432
Oh, what a fool I've been.

979
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,836
I've searched and searched
and sampled every girl I could find.

980
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:09,956
<i>Author's message: Now I see that fulfilment does
not come from short, physical, random adventures,</i>

981
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:15,473
<i>Author's message: but from a deep relationship
which is quite often under one's very nose.</i>

982
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,831
I love you, love you, love you, love you.

983
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,316
- Pussycat.
- Let's make it early Monday.

984
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,633
- Oh, I've wasted so much time.
- I can't believe that I've finally caught you!

985
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,196
You have my word as an inveterate cheat.

986
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,674
I'm the happiest woman in the world.

987
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,916
- Second happiest.
- Oh?

988
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,996
Your mother.

989
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:02,677
Renée? Hello, pussycat.

990
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,233
Um...

991
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,316
I can't make it.

992
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:12,954
I have an assignment somewhere else,
do you see? And it's an emergency.

993
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,956
Goodbye, pussycat.

994
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,075
Gradual disengagement.

995
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,479
Pussycat?

996
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,070
I'm off. See you tomorrow.

997
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,670
Have fun.
You sure you're not meeting some dolly?

998
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:36,271
Trust, my darling, trust. That's the basis
of any marriage. Do you want to come?

999
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,029
No. I have too much to do
in view of recent developments.

1000
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,755
I'll be back tomorrow. If I'm not
back tomorrow, send for the police.

1001
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:47,793
If they're not back tomorrow,
send my clothes.

1002
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,672
I love you.

1003
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,552
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1004
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,113
Philippe? It's Renée.

1005
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:03,953
Listen, what about
that weekend we talked about?

1006
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:08,710
Yes, I'm suddenly free. And I have a
reservation for two at Chateau Chantelle.

1007
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,754
Hello?

1008
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,316
I wish to speak with Miss Lefebvre please.

1009
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,755
- Mademoiselle Lefebvre.
- Yes?

1010
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,919
Mademoiselle Lefebvre, there is
a Dr Fassbender on the telephone for you.

1011
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:27,194
Tell him I've gone to South America.
But I'm going to Chateau Chantelle.

1012
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,072
Oh, oh, yes.

1013
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:34,513
I understand. Of course, of course.
Thank you, thank you. Goodbye.

1014
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,552
Anna!

1015
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,032
Anna!

1016
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:47,075
I have to go to Chateau Chantelle for the
weekend. There's an analyst's convention.

1017
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,998
But the convention was last week,
Fritz, at Arles.

1018
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,317
That was the Freudian convention,
this is the Jungian one.

1019
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,399
Anyway, didn't you tell me
you had a Women's Auxiliary singsong?

1020
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,114
But I wanted you to listen
to my lines and cue me.

1021
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,038
Cue yourself. What am I,
an automatic cueing machine?

1022
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,831
Get away from me! I hate you!

1023
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:13,670
I hate all of you. I'll kill you the next time
you come near me saying things like that.

1024
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,679
- Where are you going?
- I'm going away. Don't forget to wash.

1025
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,436
Bye.

1026
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,990
Ah, hello, Victor, you're late.
Rehearsal is over.

1027
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:44,317
How would you like to love
a very attractive short man?

1028
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,193
Certainly not. Bye.

1029
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:51,472
It's too bad because...
I have a sports car now.

1030
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,637
- You have what?
- A red sports car.

1031
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,069
- Oh, that's great.
- Wanna go for a drive?

1032
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,431
- I would love to. Come on, hurry.
- Where we gonna go?

1033
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,393
I know a nice little place
called Chateau Chantelle.

1034
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,233
- Yes?
- Michael...

1035
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,351
- Can I help you?
- Are you the maid?

1036
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,198
- In a way.
- Is Michael in?

1037
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:30,230
No. He is at Chateau Chantelle
for the weekend.

1038
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,828
Chateau Chantelle?

1039
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,996
May I ask...

1040
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,111
who are you?

1041
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,713
- I'm his fiancée.
- His what?

1042
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,390
I'm his fianc-ée.

1043
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,277
We're going away next week.
We're going to be married.

1044
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,994
<i>Here I am</i>

1045
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,752
<i>Here I stay</i>

1046
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,598
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

1047
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:26,958
- Might I ask where you came from?
- I fell from the sky!

1048
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:31,156
I'm a parachutist and I missed my mark.

1049
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:35,590
- Where are you going?
- Chateau Chantelle.

1050
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:39,759
- May I use your telephone?
- By all means.

1051
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,073
Usually I'm fantastic at hitting my target.

1052
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,397
<i>Bonjour? My name is Michael James.</i>

1053
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,715
<i>- Oh, yes, sir.
- And I'm from Chic.</i>

1054
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:21,709
Room La du Barry. Upstairs and all
the way down, the far end of the hall.

1055
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,434
I'd like this washed and pressed.

1056
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,199
No starch.

1057
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,709
- No starch.
- No starch.

1058
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,591
Fell out the sky, mate.

1059
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:40,759
Parachuting's a funny recreation for a girl.
Now, if you were a fella...

1060
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:52,399
I can understand pottery or flower
arrangement or needlework or knitting.

1061
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,149
It helps sublimate my sexual tensions.

1062
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,556
It's either that or promiscuity.

1063
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,635
Ah. La la-la.

1064
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,432
Make your phone call.

1065
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:07,031
I'm sure the club is anxious to know
the whereabouts of their little lost sheep.

1066
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,116
Geronimo.

1067
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,594
It's not fair.

1068
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:16,156
Can't I tell you about
my experience in free-falling?

1069
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:21,400
No, because I am here on a job and,
also, I'm going to marry the girl I love.

1070
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,672
So, put that away, powder your nose
and make your phone call

1071
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,236
and I shall go for a brisk six-mile trot.

1072
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:39,430
Please send up some champagne
and five dozen oysters.

1073
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,994
Philippe? Did you get the feeling
that we were followed on the road?

1074
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,556
- So what?
- We'll take two separate rooms.

1075
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,478
I'll meet you in yours. Prepare.

1076
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,989
- Michael!
- Hello.

1077
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:17,749
- What are you doing here?
- Me? Doing here... me...

1078
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,317
- Looking for you.
- But I thought you couldn't make it.

1079
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,989
Oh, I couldn't make it...
and then I could make it.

1080
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:31,717
And I, um, telephoned your house
and you weren't there... were you?

1081
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,953
No. I decided to come alone.

1082
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:40,837
That's exactly what I thought, and now
we can be together, uh, like we planned.

1083
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,831
Yes, we can. We can be together.

1084
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,999
Why don't I go up to my room, freshen up,
and we can meet here again for a drink.

1085
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,157
Right. And I'll freshen up
and we can meet in the bar

1086
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,033
all fresh and washed and rinsed.

1087
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,838
- In ten minutes?
- Roger and out.

1088
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,116
Oh, my God.

1089
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,470
- How many gallons?
- Five gallons.

1090
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,718
Do you know what's going on
at Chateau Chantelle?

1091
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,558
- Orgy.
- Orgy?

1092
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,954
Hey!

1093
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,912
My readers will be fascinated
to learn about this place.

1094
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:48,874
Now, all the rooms are
named after famous lovers?

1095
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,560
Is there any goings-on going on?

1096
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:56,071
I wouldn't mention any names but could
you tell me about your typical clientele?

1097
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,430
- My typical clientele?
- Typical clientele.

1098
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,472
All the people that are here now
are typical clientele.

1099
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,033
Really?

1100
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:07,995
There is a man cheating
on his wife in room Lola Montez.

1101
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,869
Oh.

1102
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,471
There is a woman cheating
on her two husbands in Carlota.

1103
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,877
Two lovers, of indeterminate sex,
in Reine Margot.

1104
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,753
And two men cheating in Don Juan.

1105
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,912
One might say that
the joint was, uh, jumping.

1106
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,508
<i>Yes, sir. Allô?</i>

1107
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:37,952
We make more money
in the off season than any other time.

1108
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:42,915
And now you, monsieur, with a woman
parachutist. For us, is the first time.

1109
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,349
Yes, but I'm as innocent
as a newborn babe.

1110
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:49,155
Etienne, the gentleman
in Marquis De Sade

1111
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:54,434
asks for 12 loaves of bread
and one Boy Scout's uniform.

1112
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,875
<i>Allô.</i>

1113
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,356
I want to speak with my wife. My wife.

1114
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,439
<i>Ma femme! Une femme,
ma femme! Oh! Ma femme!</i>

1115
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,989
<i>Ma femme!</i>

1116
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,795
Philippe? Oh! Michael!

1117
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,674
Oh, it's you!
I beg your body... Forgive me!

1118
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:59,588
My husband has followed me here.
If he catches me he'll cut your throat.

1119
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,154
My throat...? My... b...? Your what?

1120
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,909
My husband. I didn't bring it up
because I thought it would complicate...

1121
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:10,033
Listen. You must help me. My future
in-laws are here and they think I'm alone.

1122
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:13,755
And this lady fell from the sky
and she's gorgeous and you're gorgeous.

1123
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,429
And they'll tell Carole.
Cos her mother's a killer, she's a shark.

1124
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:20,836
We're getting married next week
and she's... nibbling my ear...

1125
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,916
Oh, my gawd.

1126
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,760
It's a shame.
But you must leave immediately!

1127
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,519
It's all right.
I'm due back at the asylum.

1128
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,915
- Oh! He's coming!
- Who's coming!

1129
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:36,190
- My husband! Quick, in the hamper!
- What?

1130
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,276
The hamper!

1131
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,276
- Are you all right?
- Of course.

1132
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:27,598
- Sorry about the way things turned out.
- 1955. A good year for brain concussions.

1133
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:32,589
I shall be cheerfully refunded if you'll
excuse my bellicose pomposity...

1134
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,919
I'm glad you're back, I think he's coming
to. Would you help me with my zipper?

1135
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,110
- My zipper!
- Oh, surely.

1136
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:54,073
Listen. I do not wish
to be involved in your marriages.

1137
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,476
If you're afraid...
Oh, look at the state... call the police.

1138
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,989
They have a very firm policy
towards murderers.

1139
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:04,796
Now, thank you, good night,
and all good things come to an end.

1140
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,876
What is going on?

1141
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,472
Michael!

1142
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,911
Michael, please come back.

1143
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,632
Oh! Oh, uh...

1144
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,432
- Herr Professor.
- Miss Lefebvre.

1145
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,391
What are you doing here?

1146
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,560
Guess what I've got on?

1147
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,831
- My hat.
- You're right.

1148
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,039
- And what else?
- I don't know.

1149
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,431
- Nothing.
- That's nice.

1150
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,679
Pussycat from the sky.

1151
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:00,438
I can't resist you.

1152
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,393
Don't resist me.

1153
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,476
Capitulate.

1154
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,234
- Please, let me in.
- No.

1155
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,999
- Please let me in, Miss Lefebvre.
- No.

1156
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,395
Let me in! Let me in! Or I'll scream!

1157
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,478
- I won't.
- What do you think I'm gonna do to you?

1158
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,956
You have a strange look in your eyes
and I'm late for an appointment.

1159
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,435
I only want to talk.
What's so awful in that?

1160
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:28,439
- Later. I've got to go someplace.
- No, now! I'm fed up with being put off!

1161
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,790
Argh!

1162
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,956
Shh.

1163
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:37,034
Five minutes of your time!

1164
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:42,473
One drink is all I ask. Otherwise I'll hold
my breath till the life goes out of my body!

1165
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,680
Doctor! Doctor!

1166
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:49,839
All right, then.
A quick, fast drink and I must really go.

1167
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:57,073
Try to think of me as a kindly old man
who has only your best interests at heart.

1168
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,349
All right.

1169
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,997
<i>- Your oysters and champagne, madame.
- Oysters and champagne?</i>

1170
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,157
- I thought you looked a little tired.
- Little tired?

1171
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:11,556
I'm out of my mind.
What am I doing here?

1172
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,274
I'm spoken for. I'm promised forth.

1173
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:20,350
Now, look! Don't open that bottle,
and close up those oysters and get out.

1174
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:24,118
- Come back to bed immediately.
- Now, look here.

1175
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:29,360
I've had a lot of experience fondling...
handling girls like you and it's got to stop.

1176
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,708
Oh!

1177
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:33,718
I'm going to try not to come back.

1178
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:41,230
Michael James, you were gravely tempted
and you came through it unspotted.

1179
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,594
I've been in there twice.

1180
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,230
Oh, Michael! There you are!

1181
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,555
I followed you up here and checked in.

1182
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:05,353
- How did you know I was here?
- Please don't hate me!

1183
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:10,395
Oh, no! I don't hate you.
Now, don't swallow anything!

1184
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,158
I'm so upset...

1185
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,158
Listen to me a minute.
I must pull myself together.

1186
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,590
- I'm fine. I'm rational.
- I want to do something terrible!

1187
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:22,918
I'm in a tight situation. I shall
behave in a mature and rational way.

1188
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:28,797
- Sometimes I wanna kill myself.
- First I shall gag you. Then I'll bind you.

1189
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,397
You're hurting me.

1190
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:37,159
My wife, the creature
that ate Europe, is here.

1191
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,033
- You're breaking my wrist!
- I'm a doctor, I'll fix it!

1192
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,196
Let me go!

1193
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,909
Fritz! Where are you?

1194
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,875
I am being chased by a maniac.
Could you help?

1195
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,798
- Quick! Get in the closet.
- In the closet.

1196
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,876
Thank you very much.

1197
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:36,719
Oh, Victor. I can't let you make love to me
with a person in the closet.

1198
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:40,594
Why, how many people
in the closet do you need?

1199
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:45,480
<i>Please help me!</i>

1200
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:54,438
- My wife is coming. I've got to hide!
- Quick, get in the closet!

1201
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,910
Argh! Help!

1202
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,474
That man was the maniac!

1203
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:13,149
A little misunderstanding, nothing more.

1204
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:19,918
<i>Hey, that's some closet
you've got there.</i>

1205
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,636
Fritz!

1206
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,639
Please, where is he now?
I've just been tied up.

1207
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:51,797
I know. There is a maniac loose.
Come with me.

1208
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,876
- Fritz!
- Argh!

1209
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,756
Let us in!

1210
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,991
Hello. The police?

1211
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,236
I need help.

1212
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:31,513
- The orgy's in here!
- We're the first ones!

1213
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:34,279
- What a lovely way to start.
- Hi! Wait for me!

1214
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,439
You are horrible people!
Get away from me! Michael!

1215
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,791
Wait! Wait! You! Stop!

1216
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,388
- Who is that woman?
- Is she dead?

1217
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,956
Dead? Sure, she's dead.
But she did not die in vain.

1218
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:53,632
Because of her, thousands of Frenchmen
will be free someday. For France I do this!

1219
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,239
Oh!

1220
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,715
Smoking is forbidden.

1221
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,556
Oh!

1222
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,678
You've got to help.
There are lots of dreadful men after me.

1223
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,479
This is no place for a working girl.
Come on!

1224
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:17,715
Goody goody!

1225
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:21,230
There's one in there. One in there.
Another one there. I'm off!

1226
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,638
- Michael! There you are!
- Hello, there.

1227
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:31,911
- Who is your fiancée?
- Welcome to Chateau Chantelle.

1228
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:36,397
A girl called. She said she was meeting
you here and she was your fiancée.

1229
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:39,353
That's absurd. You're my fiancée
and I don't know any...

1230
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:43,189
- Let's go to your room and have a talk.
- My room?

1231
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,993
How about a nice drive in the country?
It's so pretty.

1232
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,715
I've been driving all day.
I want to sit down and speak to you.

1233
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,400
Let's go into the bar.
We can have a nice drink.

1234
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:56,308
I'd like to do it in private because
I may have to scream and throw things.

1235
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:00,035
- I feel we should be alone for that.
- Oh, a sense of humour.

1236
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:04,870
Michael! I've been looking all over for you!
You're the only one that can help me.

1237
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,956
- Our Father...
- Who is that woman?

1238
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,435
Never mind who I am,
but you're in great danger.

1239
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,630
Never mind? I demand an explanation!

1240
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:16,072
- Don't lose your temper!
- I will... lose... it!

1241
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:18,634
Calm yourself.

1242
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:21,991
Listen. In the first place,
I haven't got another fiancée.

1243
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:26,398
In the second place,
you don't trust me in the first place.

1244
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,836
Fritz!

1245
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:36,869
Before you use that spear, may I explain
that what you see is merely an illusion.

1246
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,356
- An illusion?
- An illusion! Shut the door, count three.

1247
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:44,871
Four if you like, but close the door
and you'll see it's just an illusion.

1248
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,356
One. Two. Three.

1249
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,550
Foiled by a cheap cinematic trick.

1250
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:55,674
- If you insist, you can see my room.
- You've got some tall explaining to do.

1251
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,678
I have never seen
that woman before in my life.

1252
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,075
I thought you were here
for a quiet bit of work.

1253
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,839
Of course I am. It's a charming little spot.

1254
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,633
- No one ever comes here.
- How much work have you done?

1255
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:09,320
- I've only just got here!
- Can I see your room?

1256
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,716
Certainly. It's over there.
It's a perfectly ordinary room.

1257
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,796
- Is it?
- Listen, pussycat.

1258
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:17,639
- I don't think so.
- Listen! It is!

1259
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,354
I won't spend my whole life
waiting around for you.

1260
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,436
Nothing like a hard day's work, huh?

1261
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,994
Look. I came here alone.
This crowd showed up.

1262
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:35,511
It's been a tremendous mistake.
I know, because I made it.

1263
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:40,314
Oh, Michael, darling.
Please... don't let them take me.

1264
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:44,797
A perfect stranger.
Lucky guess about the name.

1265
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:47,992
Oh, Michael. Everybody's insane.
Take me away from this place.

1266
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:51,237
- Who is that woman?
- She's only 12 and she's an orphan.

1267
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:55,353
- Once a year I take her out.
- Help me! They're after me! I did nothing.

1268
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:58,358
Put that in the shower!

1269
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:01,392
- Here I am, you French hunk of pie...
- Stay back!

1270
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,239
<i>Stick it in the tub
and drown it, you twit!</i>

1271
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,920
<i>Not in here, you fool. I'm hiding.</i>

1272
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,998
Oh, Michael! This hotel
has the strangest people.

1273
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:13,237
- Why did you abandon me?
- She has a PhD.

1274
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,316
<i>In what?</i>

1275
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:19,556
You fool. Just when I was
trying to give up smoking.

1276
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:26,594
- Oh, Michael. What a pleasant surprise.
- My compliments to the chef.

1277
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,389
- Who are you?
- I'm delighted.

1278
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,356
I kill him! I kill everybody!

1279
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:53,471
You don't understand.
There are people in here trying to sleep.

1280
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:59,075
- Who is that thing?
- That is no thing, this is my wife.

1281
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:02,158
- This is a personal friend of James Bond.
- How dare you!

1282
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:06,717
Listen, pussycat. I do assure you. Take all
the pussycats, stand them all in a row...

1283
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:11,755
- Who are these people?
...you stand above them like a mountain...

1284
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:14,314
- Carole!
- Mother, Dad! Come over here.

1285
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:16,795
- Did you set the date yet?
- We're about to.

1286
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,514
What's the matter, dear? You look sick.

1287
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,274
<i>The police!</i>

1288
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,794
Oy vey.

1289
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:51,673
Anna! Up the front.

1290
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,476
Form up, everyone.

1291
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:02,475
<i>Charge!</i>

1292
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:27,029
There lies our only conceivable
way of escape. To it, pell-mell!

1293
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,037
<i>Away you go!</i>

1294
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,510
- Hey!
- Aaah!

1295
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,392
Carole!

1296
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:57,839
Michael James,
upon this solemn occasion,

1297
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:01,032
do you take this woman
to be your lawful married wife?

1298
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:02,798
I do.

1299
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:05,229
Do you, Carole Hildegarde Werner,

1300
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:08,796
take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband?

1301
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:11,195
I do.

1302
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,390
Best man, have you the ring?

1303
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,916
I do.

1304
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,270
We live in perilous times.

1305
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,358
Look after it, it belongs to my wife.

1306
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:38,315
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1307
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:49,790
<i>- Merci, Monsieur le maire.
- Madame.</i>

1308
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,276
Thank you for everything you did for him.

1309
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:03,790
Well, Mayor, there's gratitude for you.
You raise a patient, treat him like a son,

1310
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,549
slave all day over a hot analyst's couch.
What do you get in return?

1311
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,910
They don't even invite you
on the honeymoon.

1312
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:13,913
What is your full name, please?

1313
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:19,318
Michael Voltaire James, pussycat.

1314
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,716
<i>And yours, madame?</i>

1315
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:26,355
- Carole Hildegarde Werner.
- Were you snapping then?

1316
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:30,268
- Why did you call her pussycat?
- I was being courteous. I was being civil.

1317
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,994
We're married 30 seconds
and you look at other women.

1318
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:36,795
She was talking to me. I looked in
the direction the sound was coming from.

1319
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:39,559
- You can go on the honeymoon alone.
- Darling...

1320
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:44,399
I'm the witness, also the best man.

1321
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,954
My name is Fritz Wolfgang...

1322
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:50,550
Sigismund... Fassbender.

1323
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,274
What's the matter, darling?
You look worried.

1324
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,994
I can't spell Sigismund.

1325
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:01,712
I think you have a little sexual block
over the spelling of that naughty name.

1326
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:04,638
Allow me to help you.
I'm a psychoanalyst.

1327
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:10,471
Oh, Michael, you didn't change at all. All
this good doctor's work has been in vain.

1328
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:15,558
Perhaps I haven't lost a son.
Maybe I've gained another patient.

1329
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,671
<i>Now, look...</i>

1330
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:20,155
<i>Pussycat, pussycat, you're so thrilling</i>

1331
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:24,159
<i>And I'm so willing to care for you</i>

1332
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:30,071
<i>So go and make up
your big little pussycat eyes</i>

1333
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:33,795
<i>Pussycat, pussycat, I love you</i>

1334
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,469
<i>Yes, I do</i>

1335
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:41,434
<i>You and your pussycat eyes</i>

1336
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:45,394
<i>What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-o-o</i>

1337
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,638
<i>What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-o-o-o</i>

1338
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:55,874
<i>What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-o-o</i>

1339
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,276
<i>What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-o-o-o</i>
