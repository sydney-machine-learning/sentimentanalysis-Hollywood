00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:35,582
<i>Michael.</i>

3
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:38,686
<i>Dear Michael. Of course it's you.
Who else could they send?</i>

4
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:40,185
<i>Who else could be trusted?</i>

5
00:00:40,356 --> 00:00:43,086
<i>And I know it's a long way
and you're ready to go to work.</i>

6
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,558
<i>All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just...
Just please hear me out.</i>

7
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:49,926
<i>Because this is not an episode,
relapse, fuckup.</i>

8
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:52,659
<i>I'm begging you, Michael,
I'm begging you.</i>

9
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:55,668
<i>Try and make believe
this is not just madness...</i>

10
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:58,864
<i>... because this is not just madness.</i>

11
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,472
<i>Two weeks ago,
I came out of the building, okay?</i>

12
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,169
<i>I'm running across 6th Avenue,
there's a car waiting...</i>

13
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:07,543
<i>... I got exactly 38 minutes to get
to the airport, and I'm dictating.</i>

14
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:10,480
<i>There's this panicked associate
sprinting along beside me...</i>

15
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,178
<i>... scribbling in a notepad,
and she starts screaming.</i>

16
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:16,290
<i>And I realize we're standing
in the middle of the street...</i>

17
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:20,451
<i>... the light's changed and there's this wall
of serious traffic speeding towards us.</i>

18
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:22,654
<i>And I freeze. I can't move.</i>

19
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:25,459
<i>I'm suddenly consumed
with the overwhelming sensation...</i>

20
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:27,659
<i>... that I'm covered
with some sort of film.</i>

21
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:32,432
<i>And it's in my hair, in my face.
And it's like a glaze, like a coating.</i>

22
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:35,372
<i>And at first I thought,
"Oh, my God, I know what this is.</i>

23
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:37,978
<i>This is some sort of amniotic,
embryonic fluid.</i>

24
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:39,842
<i>I'm drenched in afterbirth.</i>

25
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:42,677
<i>I've breached the chrysalis.
I've been reborn. "</i>

26
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:46,150
<i>But then, the traffic, the stampede,
the cars, the trucks, the horns...</i>

27
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:50,349
<i>... this poor woman screaming,
and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth.</i>

28
00:01:50,526 --> 00:01:53,393
<i>This is some kind of giddy illusion
of renewal...</i>

29
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:56,326
<i>... that happens in
the final moment before death. "</i>

30
00:01:56,498 --> 00:02:00,093
<i>And then I realize,
"No, no, no, this is completely wrong"...</i>

31
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:03,238
<i>... because I looked back
at the building...</i>

32
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:06,033
<i>... and I had the most stunning
moment of clarity.</i>

33
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,301
<i>I realized, Michael...</i>

34
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:12,504
<i>... that I had emerged, not through
the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...</i>

35
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:15,980
<i>... not through the portals
of our vast and powerful law firm...</i>

36
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:18,949
<i>... but from the asshole of an organism...</i>

37
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:23,751
<i>... whose sole function is
to excrete the poison...</i>

38
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:27,293
<i>... the ammo, the defoliant necessary
for other larger...</i>

39
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:31,024
<i>... more powerful organisms
to destroy the miracle of humanity.</i>

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,068
<i>And that I had been coated
in this patina of shit...</i>

41
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:37,432
<i>... for the best part of my life.</i>

42
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:41,440
<i>And the stench of it, the stain of it
would take the rest of my life to undo.</i>

43
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,872
<i>And you know what I did?</i>

44
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:46,776
<i>I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

45
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:51,352
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

46
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,718
<i>... as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

47
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,359
<i>It must stand the test of time. "</i>

48
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:01,553
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

49
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:07,034
I'm not sure what else I can tell you
that I haven't already.

50
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:09,727
<i>Tell me about U/North, Barry.
They're your clients.</i>

51
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:14,137
<i>So you tell me why you're settling
a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.</i>

52
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:17,005
<i>Because I'm writing this story
whether you like it or not.</i>

53
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:18,510
What does that exactly mean?

54
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:21,081
<i>Give me something I can print.</i>

55
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,853
We found 97.

56
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:39,560
<i>I've got that cunt from
The Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.</i>

57
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:41,896
She will not go away.

58
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:46,864
Marty Bach. How can I help you?

59
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:50,136
<i>Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein.
We're going with a story tomorrow...</i>

60
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:53,543
<i>... about a settlement in the U/North
defoliant case. You wanna comment?</i>

61
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:57,083
Case you're referring to is now,
as it has been for the past six years...

62
00:03:57,252 --> 00:03:59,117
...pending and unresolved.

63
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:01,882
Till such time as our client
has their day in court...

64
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:05,549
...or the plaintiffs drop the suit,
I'll have nothing of value to tell you.

65
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:08,788
<i>Come on, Marty, you're closing
the U/North case. You're settling.</i>

66
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:13,424
<i>I know that. I know you're up there with
600 people jamming this thing through.</i>

67
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:16,036
Here's what I know.
Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.

68
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:19,697
So you're fishing for a story or
trying to get out of writing a retraction.

69
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,366
In either case,
I wish you the best of luck.

70
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,504
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?

71
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:15,986
I'll see the turn.

72
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:23,528
Check.

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,302
Check.

74
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:28,040
Check.

75
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,201
Half the pot. Two hundred.

76
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,074
Two hundred to go.

77
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:44,454
You don't remember me, huh?

78
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,955
We played together a couple times.

79
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,223
That lamp place on Bowery.

80
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,061
That guy's showroom?
All the lamps and shit?

81
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,637
- The Galaxy.
- That's it.

82
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:59,001
You had a restaurant
you were opening, right?

83
00:05:59,174 --> 00:06:02,405
My old partner bid that job,
the plumbing.

84
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:05,978
- You don't remember me?
- I remember you.

85
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:08,412
Because I lost a lot of weight since then.

86
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,914
You bought some hair too.

87
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:13,384
With your money.

88
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:16,653
So, what happened with the bar?

89
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:18,588
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

90
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,924
Shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King,
I go home and put the fucking TV on.

91
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,566
That was a good location.

92
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:28,567
Yeah, that's what my partner
kept telling me.

93
00:06:29,104 --> 00:06:30,537
Action's on you.

94
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:32,936
I bet the pot.

95
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,508
Good to see you again.

96
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:11,301
Hello?

97
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,742
<i>- Michael.
- Walter.</i>

98
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:16,146
<i>Michael, thank God, there you are.
Look, I got a situation.</i>

99
00:07:16,318 --> 00:07:20,414
<i>A big problem, all right? A client of mine,
he just called, he hit a guy with his car.</i>

100
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:22,489
<i>He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.</i>

101
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:23,647
Just now?

102
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:26,487
<i>Yeah, just now. Ten, 15 minutes ago.
He's driving home.</i>

103
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:28,721
<i>He's home now. He's there waiting.</i>

104
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,057
Where?

105
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:34,066
<i>Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.
He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.</i>

106
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,260
Is he drunk?

107
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:38,304
<i>No. It's the first thing I asked him.
He's good, he's sober.</i>

108
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:39,963
Tell him to stay off the phone.

109
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:42,406
<i>All right. But you're on it?
You can get up there?</i>

110
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:44,340
<i>Because this guy, he's a huge client.</i>

111
00:07:44,913 --> 00:07:47,074
<i>This is half my book, this guy, okay?</i>

112
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:48,682
I'm walking to the car now.

113
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,217
<i>Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back
and I'll get the address.</i>

114
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:55,982
<i>Just let me know you're on the way,
and I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

115
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:57,591
All right. I'll be in the car.

116
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,944
<i>What they did, see,
they changed the grade there.</i>

117
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,913
They widened the street.

118
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:58,985
I'm sure somebody told them
that that was an improvement.

119
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:03,648
But now, you see, when it rains and when
there is fog, and with this new angle...

120
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:07,420
...and they've got these new...
These... These...

121
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,689
These sodium lamps, it's blinding.

122
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:13,130
- That corner there. It is blinding.
- They'll have to work that out.

123
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:16,134
And it's not just tonight.
I've been saying this for years.

124
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:20,934
I mean, how many times have we talked
about that corner? Dell?

125
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,373
Mr. Greer, we don't have
a lot of time here.

126
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:28,482
So the circumstances, the road conditions,
none of this holds any interest for you?

127
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,551
What interests me is finding
the strongest criminal attorney...

128
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,312
...that can be here in 15 minutes.

129
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:36,722
Well, that sounds ominous.

130
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:39,452
We have some good relationships
up here in Westchester.

131
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:42,563
So, what are you? What are you?
You're not a lawyer?

132
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:44,528
- Not the kind you need.
- What kind is that?

133
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:45,688
A trial lawyer.

134
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:48,730
Somebody who can see this through.
That's not what I do.

135
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:52,465
Okay. I think we're gonna have to
pull Walter back in on this.

136
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:55,633
I wanna get Walter back on the phone,
get him back into the mix.

137
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:59,542
Because, I'll be frank with you,
I don't like the way this is going.

138
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:03,377
Sir, we don't have time for Walter.
Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.

139
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:05,611
What options?
I'm not hearing any options!

140
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:07,015
I suggest you go local...

141
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,056
...and I'm telling you there are
people here I like for this.

142
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:12,284
Great. That's it?
That's what you got for me?

143
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,486
Hey, you believe this?

144
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:16,961
I have been a client at Kenner, Bach
for 12 years!

145
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:20,863
You think I paid that retainer every month
for a place at the back of the line?

146
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:24,335
Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident
on a slow weeknight...

147
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:26,701
...six miles from
the state police barracks.

148
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,105
If there's a line,
you're right up front.

149
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:32,144
I can get a lawyer any time I want.
I don't need you for that.

150
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:36,216
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes
waiting for a goddamn referral!

151
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:38,147
I don't know what Walter
promised you...

152
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,778
A miracle worker! That's Walter
on the phone, 20 minutes ago.

153
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:45,051
Direct quote, okay? "Hang tight.
I'm sending you a miracle worker."

154
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,854
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?

155
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:49,622
That you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're good at it?

156
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:51,265
Elliot.

157
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,726
The guy was running! In the street!

158
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:59,636
You take that, you add the fog,
you add the lamps, you add the angle...

159
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:04,635
What the fuck is he doing running in
the middle of the street at midnight?!

160
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:07,008
You answer me that!

161
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:22,728
What if someone had stolen the car?

162
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,062
Happens all the time.

163
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:29,328
Cops like hit-and-runs.

164
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:31,529
They work them hard,
they clear them fast.

165
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:34,903
Right now there's a B.C.I. Unit
pulling paint chips off a guard rail.

166
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:38,409
Tomorrow, they're gonna be looking
for the owner of a custom-painted...

167
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,810
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.

168
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:42,574
And the guy you hit?

169
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:46,118
If he got a look at the plates,
it won't even take that long.

170
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:51,053
There's no play here.

171
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,192
There's no angle.
There's no champagne room.

172
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:57,024
I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.

173
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,257
The math on this is simple.

174
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:02,426
The smaller the mess,
the easier it is for me to clean up.

175
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:07,702
That's the police, isn't it?

176
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:09,275
No.

177
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,772
They don't call.

178
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:17,883
Hello.

179
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:21,252
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.

180
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:23,891
Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.

181
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:26,956
No. I'm in the neighborhood.

182
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:29,193
You got a pen?

183
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:13,779
Mom, where's my cards?

184
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,658
Where's my cards?

185
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,207
Is my other deck in here?

186
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:37,776
Did you eat?

187
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,846
Dad's down there waiting already.

188
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:41,879
There were cards in our bathroom.

189
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,312
Yes, I had a waffle.

190
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:46,352
Since we're out of waffles,
I don't see how that's possible.

191
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:47,852
It's a miracle.

192
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,150
Gloves?

193
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:00,957
Henry!

194
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,139
Come on.

195
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:10,474
Get in.

196
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:14,078
Got it?

197
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:22,481
<i>So no one's even sure
exactly where they are...</i>

198
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:25,820
...because there's no borders
or landmarks or anything.

199
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:28,724
And the town?
It's not even a town really.

200
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:32,094
It just is this camp where all these people
have gathered to hide.

201
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:33,256
Right.

202
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:36,892
All these deserters and guys
that got cut off from their armies.

203
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:40,234
All these people that are hiding
in the woods, trying to stay alive.

204
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:42,308
This is where they all came.

205
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:45,469
There's Thieves, Gray Mages,
Unbidden Warriors...

206
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,672
...Dark Avians,
Riverwynders and Sappers.

207
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:51,012
- There's, like, 15 different characters, okay?
- Okay.

208
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:53,215
And nobody has any alliances.

209
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:56,653
You can't even say who you are
because, you don't know...

210
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:58,815
...maybe the person you're talking to...

211
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:01,484
...maybe they're like your mortal enemy
in the wars.

212
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,359
So it's just completely like
everybody for themselves.

213
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:05,863
Sounds familiar.

214
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:08,969
It's really good.
I'm serious, you should really read it.

215
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:12,300
Right. But by the time I finish it,
you'll be on to something else.

216
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:15,237
- How much you wanna bet?
- I don't know. How much you got?

217
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:18,241
- You got your bus pass?
- It's in my locker.

218
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:21,280
You're not even gonna look at it,
are you?

219
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:22,882
- The book?
- Yes.

220
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,450
Bring it on Saturday, I'll...

221
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:27,850
I did already. I left it in your kitchen.
It's got a red cover.

222
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:29,148
Okay.

223
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:31,724
Well, here we go.

224
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:34,589
Go. Teach these people something,
would you?

225
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,225
- See you later, Dad.
- Yeah, kiddo.

226
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:44,771
Thanks.

227
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:54,572
<i>Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls,
assorted sizes.</i>

228
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:57,718
<i>Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars I have.</i>

229
00:18:57,885 --> 00:19:00,979
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50.
Sixty dollars back there.

230
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:03,385
Sixty dollars, get me to 70.
I got 70 dollars.

231
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:06,083
Seventy dollars, I have now, 70.
Eighty dollars there.

232
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,660
Eighty dollars, this gentleman here.
Eighty dollars.

233
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,560
Ninety dollars there. Give me 100.
One hundred I have now.

234
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:25,475
He says you're still gonna be short.

235
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:29,373
How short?

236
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,951
Sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.

237
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:36,181
- That's liquor and everything?
- What'd you think it was gonna be?

238
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:39,349
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.

239
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:43,395
He took 1500 on a refrigerator
I paid four grand for.

240
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:45,191
Make a bid.

241
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:49,425
Are you telling me you don't have
the 75 thousand?

242
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:51,663
Just lying around, no.

243
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:56,266
We both know it's your brother
I should be talking to.

244
00:19:56,444 --> 00:19:57,468
Forget that.

245
00:19:57,645 --> 00:20:01,945
Michael, look, you wanna front this,
that's up to you.

246
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:05,347
But Timmy's name stays in the book
till we're clear.

247
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,120
If I know where he is,
I don't have to keep asking.

248
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,988
He's upstate. His wife took him back.
I don't know where he is.

249
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:15,959
He's gotta have something.

250
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,620
He's got the two kids with her.

251
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,462
He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress
that he knocked up.

252
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:26,300
He's got four Michelin radials
that he stole from my sister's garage.

253
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:29,371
Make an offer.

254
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:36,180
I had a wife who was a drunk.
She was a beautiful girl, young girl.

255
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,912
But live like that? Even they do a program...
She did, I think, once, two years.

256
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:43,080
And then they slip? Forget it.

257
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:45,623
It's like you're strapped to a bomb.

258
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:48,788
What's my timeframe here?

259
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:51,121
I don't know.

260
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,290
I didn't think it'd be a problem.

261
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:56,426
I'll ask.

262
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:26,160
- Hey, Michael.
- Morning, Carl.

263
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:37,673
I don't know. Del, I don't know
how hard you want me to press here.

264
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:39,836
Let me know how brave he wants to be.

265
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:42,346
<i>Well, I'm not sure how brave
he can be right now.</i>

266
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:44,849
<i>We just got a confirmation hearing
scheduled.</i>

267
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:46,418
Any chance she knows that?

268
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:50,216
<i>Well, it was in the paper. Who knows?
Maybe she got someone to read it to her.</i>

269
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:52,916
<i>She called his wife yesterday.
She's calling his house.</i>

270
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,322
<i>This is a total nightmare.</i>

271
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:56,622
Well, my guess is
she's gonna want the condo.

272
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:57,856
<i>Come on, that's insane.</i>

273
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:01,559
Well, what can I tell you?
Don't piss off a motivated stripper.

274
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:02,930
<i>It's just unbelievable.</i>

275
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:06,369
All right. Well, find out his pain threshold
and get back to me.

276
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,441
Or you can tell him to call me directly.

277
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,600
<i>All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.</i>

278
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:11,938
Thanks.

279
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:13,740
Hey, where are we with Marty?

280
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:16,239
We left word.

281
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,578
Hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?

282
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,744
<i>He's not a kid. He's 22.</i>

283
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,583
<i>- This is Miami?
- Nope. Key Biscayne.</i>

284
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:24,247
And they charged him.

285
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:27,724
<i>Reckless endangerment. My client...</i>

286
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:33,333
<i>I think really what they want, they want
a reality check on the attorney down there.</i>

287
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:35,560
<i>- Yeah.
- Wayne said you have some connections?</i>

288
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:38,261
<i>- Yeah, let me get a pen.
- Thank you.</i>

289
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,066
Now, if she calls the INS directly,
she's gonna get nowhere.

290
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:43,471
<i>Even with the appointment?</i>

291
00:22:43,644 --> 00:22:46,135
It's retail, Evan.
It's like the DMV over there.

292
00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:49,647
Unless they get a call from
a district supervisor, then nobody moves.

293
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:51,375
<i>But your guy can do that?</i>

294
00:22:51,552 --> 00:22:52,883
He's a former commissioner.

295
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:55,989
<i>None of this comes back to me?
Because that doesn't do any good.</i>

296
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,250
No, look, I'm gonna be
the one that's asking.

297
00:22:58,426 --> 00:23:00,758
<i>- Can you hang on a minute?
- Yeah, sure.</i>

298
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:03,860
Are we merging?

299
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:06,527
Marty Bach's in London.

300
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:09,795
They said he was in Atlanta,
then Lara said he was in the building.

301
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,098
So I called back.
I know you want this meeting.

302
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:14,833
Now she tells me the truth.
He's really in London.

303
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:18,206
So are we merging?
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

304
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:20,506
All these Brits?
That this time it's for real.

305
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:22,478
Like I would know.

306
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:24,345
I don't know.

307
00:23:24,518 --> 00:23:28,181
But even if we are, I mean, even if
they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?

308
00:23:28,956 --> 00:23:30,617
Your phone's ringing.

309
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:32,959
Evan?

310
00:23:33,728 --> 00:23:36,492
Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.

311
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:39,633
Let me give him a call
and set up a meeting for next week.

312
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,200
I'll walk her in,
I'll make the introduction...

313
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,931
<i>At the moment,
U/North currently has 70,000 employees...</i>

314
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:49,133
<i>... in 62 countries around the world.</i>

315
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:52,338
<i>Around the planet.</i>

316
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:57,212
<i>Operating in 62 countries
around the planet.</i>

317
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,052
At work in more than 60 countries
around the globe.

318
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:08,895
We have... We have, right now...
We have...

319
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:12,294
At U/North right now,
we've got 75,000 employees...

320
00:24:12,466 --> 00:24:15,230
...in over 60 countries around the planet.

321
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:18,167
We are a very successful
and highly diversified company...

322
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:20,068
...so you can imagine...

323
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:23,677
...the volume and the variety
of legal issues we have to deal with is...

324
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:25,311
Overwhelming.

325
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:28,714
It's just enormous.

326
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:32,515
So you can imagine,
the volume of legal issues...

327
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:36,085
It's quite substantial.

328
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,851
<i>And as general counsel, what I do...</i>

329
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:41,221
...what our in-house department does...

330
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:46,662
...is to analyze the dimension
of the problem or the opportunity...

331
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:49,166
...to determine the jurisdiction...

332
00:24:49,337 --> 00:24:51,567
...and to outsource our business...

333
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:55,197
...to those firms and talents
that we think can help us the most.

334
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:58,237
<i>So with all that pressure and workload...</i>

335
00:24:58,412 --> 00:25:01,745
<i>... how do you keep a balance
between work and life?</i>

336
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,383
<i>Balance?</i>

337
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:09,218
I think that's... That's something that...

338
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,723
...you search for your whole life, isn't it?

339
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:15,691
It's a shifting balance, really.

340
00:25:15,863 --> 00:25:19,026
It's, you know, you... You try to...

341
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,499
<i>When you really are enjoying
what it is you do...</i>

342
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,535
...who needs balance?

343
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:28,130
There's your balance.
There's your balance.

344
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:32,268
When you're really enjoying
what it is you do, there is your balance.

345
00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:34,607
When Don asked me to take...

346
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:37,250
When Don Jeffries brought...
Don Jeffries brought me...

347
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:40,387
Don Jeffries brought me in here
12 years ago...

348
00:25:40,554 --> 00:25:43,648
...trusted me, mentored me.

349
00:25:43,824 --> 00:25:46,793
Welcomed me into the U/North family.

350
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:51,295
And when he moved up to the boardroom,
I never really...

351
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:55,626
...dreamt that I would have
the opportunity to move into his position.

352
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:58,567
But, is it challenging? Yes.

353
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:04,405
And I think that it's possible that those
first few months were a little shaky.

354
00:26:04,578 --> 00:26:09,675
But then you realize that you've been
taught to be ready, and you take the helm.

355
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,843
Because if you're not comfortable
with that level of responsibility...

356
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:15,852
...you're in the wrong place.

357
00:26:16,023 --> 00:26:21,120
It's your department, your capacity to
make tough decisions in real time, and...

358
00:26:21,962 --> 00:26:23,725
We're in the middle of an interview.

359
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:25,866
They said it was urgent.

360
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:29,335
Jesus.

361
00:26:30,037 --> 00:26:31,834
For chrissake.

362
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:35,272
You're saying he did this in...?

363
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:36,501
Oh, my God.

364
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:39,339
- Barry.
- Hang on.

365
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:44,978
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked
in a deposition room in Milwaukee.

366
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:48,318
<i>Oh, Michael...</i>

367
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:52,152
<i>... I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

368
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:57,127
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

369
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:01,064
<i>... as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

370
00:27:01,235 --> 00:27:04,227
<i>It must stand the test of time. "</i>

371
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:07,169
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

372
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:10,799
<i>This moment, today,
here, this room, this air...</i>

373
00:27:10,978 --> 00:27:15,381
<i>... and this, especially this, Michael,
that you're here.</i>

374
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:17,346
<i>There's a reason.</i>

375
00:27:17,518 --> 00:27:19,213
<i>A reason it's you, Michael.</i>

376
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:23,880
<i>Surely, you have some sense of that,
how it pulls together, how it gathers.</i>

377
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:27,789
<i>Nurse Michael, the secret hero,
the keeper of the hidden sins.</i>

378
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:30,226
<i>Tell me you can see that, Michael,
for God's sake.</i>

379
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:35,532
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes.
The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.

380
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:39,400
It was... It was... It was a mistake.
It was wrong. It was lame.

381
00:27:39,573 --> 00:27:42,667
It was obvious. And therapeutically,
it was completely useless...

382
00:27:42,843 --> 00:27:46,210
...because I swear, I could stand here
and tear off my fucking skin...

383
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:51,111
...and I could not get down
to where this thing is living.

384
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:55,016
Six years, Michael.
Six years I've absorbed this poison.

385
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:58,454
Four hundred depositions,
a hundred motions, five changes of venue...

386
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:01,060
...85,000 documents in discovery.

387
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:05,426
Six years of scheming and stalling
and screaming, and what have I got?

388
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,059
I've spent 12 percent of my life defending
the reputation of a deadly weed killer!

389
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:12,330
- We had an agreement, Arthur.
- One night.

390
00:28:12,506 --> 00:28:15,441
One night, right?
I look up and there's Marty in my office.

391
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:16,940
He's got some champagne.

392
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:21,878
He tells me we just hit 30,000 billable hours
on U/North and he wants to celebrate.

393
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:25,576
So an hour later, I find myself
in a whorehouse in Chelsea...

394
00:28:25,753 --> 00:28:29,154
...with two Lithuanian redheads
taking turns sucking my dick.

395
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:33,419
I'm laying there and I'm trying not
to come and I wanna...

396
00:28:33,594 --> 00:28:35,892
I wanna make it last,
so I start doing the math.

397
00:28:36,063 --> 00:28:39,294
I think, "Thirty thousand hours,
what is that? That's 24 times 30.

398
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:44,563
That's 720 hours in a month,
8760 hours in a year..."

399
00:28:44,738 --> 00:28:46,296
- Arthur.
- No, wait, wait, wait!

400
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:49,806
Because it's years! It's lives!

401
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:52,810
And the numbers are making me dizzy
and, you know...

402
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,178
...now, instead of trying not to come,
I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

403
00:28:57,351 --> 00:28:58,750
I mean, is this me?

404
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,253
Am I this freak organism that has been
sent here to sleep and eat...

405
00:29:03,424 --> 00:29:07,622
...and defend this one horrific chain
of carcinogenic molecules?

406
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:09,786
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?

407
00:29:09,964 --> 00:29:12,194
- Listen, you promised me.
- Is that it, Michael?

408
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:15,335
Is that my grail?
Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?

409
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:18,062
Is that the correct answer
to the multiple choice of me?

410
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:21,436
You wanna go off your medication,
that's fine. But you call me first.

411
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:23,270
- That was our agreement.
- Sue me.

412
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:24,638
We okay in there?

413
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:28,343
We're fine. We're fine.

414
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:34,012
They killed them, Michael.

415
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:37,385
Those small farms, the family farms.

416
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:40,083
Did you...? Did you...?
Did you meet Anna?

417
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:41,285
No.

418
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:44,556
You gotta see her, you gotta talk to her.
She's a miracle, Michael.

419
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:46,723
She's God's perfect little creature.

420
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,336
And for 50 million dollars in fees,
I've spent 12 percent of my life...

421
00:29:50,504 --> 00:29:54,133
...destroying perfect Anna
and her dead parents and her dying brother.

422
00:29:54,308 --> 00:29:56,071
When did you last take one of these?

423
00:29:56,243 --> 00:29:58,973
No. I'm not losing this.
Everything is finally significant.

424
00:29:59,146 --> 00:30:01,580
The world is a beautiful place.
I'm not trading that.

425
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:05,014
- If it's real, the pill won't kill it.
- I have blood on my hands.

426
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:07,847
You are senior litigating partner
of one of the largest...

427
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:10,718
...most respected law firms in the world.
You are a legend.

428
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:13,223
- I'm an accomplice!
- You're a manic-depressive.

429
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:16,696
I am Shiva, the god of death.

430
00:30:17,097 --> 00:30:20,089
Let's get out of Milwaukee,
we'll talk about it.

431
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:26,232
<i>We came back from the hospital
and everybody was crying...</i>

432
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:30,434
<i>... and we were in shock, but we still...
We had to milk.</i>

433
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:33,045
<i>The cows won't wait, will they?</i>

434
00:30:33,213 --> 00:30:34,202
<i>No.</i>

435
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:37,406
<i>And when you went to the barn?</i>

436
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:40,178
<i>We found the note. My sister found it.</i>

437
00:30:40,354 --> 00:30:42,584
<i>- From your mother?
- Yes.</i>

438
00:30:42,756 --> 00:30:44,747
<i>Could you read it for us, please?</i>

439
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:49,088
<i>Just read the third paragraph,
just the highlighted section there.</i>

440
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,526
<i>"I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy
or any of the people... "</i>

441
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,928
<i>Anna.</i>

442
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:56,364
<i>- Anna.
- "Down at...</i>

443
00:30:56,537 --> 00:30:58,198
<i>It's all right, Anna, go on.</i>

444
00:30:58,372 --> 00:31:00,272
<i>- I'm just...
- Excuse me.</i>

445
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,534
<i>- Anna, they're...
- What's he doing?</i>

446
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,406
<i>Excuse me. She's a...
No, this is testimony. This is...</i>

447
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:07,570
<i>Excuse me, I have an objection.</i>

448
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:10,114
<i>You can be a witness here.
You can be a witness.</i>

449
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:11,979
<i>I am not a witness to this, sir, l...</i>

450
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:14,746
<i>Anna, I love you.</i>

451
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:19,825
<i>And I'm sitting here
and I'm listening to you and I swear...</i>

452
00:31:19,993 --> 00:31:24,760
<i>... that I love you more than anything
in the world. And this is my moment.</i>

453
00:31:24,932 --> 00:31:28,732
<i>This strange conference-table moment.</i>

454
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:30,802
<i>Turn off that camera!</i>

455
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:34,864
<i>- This is my offering!
- No, I want this on the record!</i>

456
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:36,270
<i>How do I turn it off?</i>

457
00:31:36,443 --> 00:31:39,970
<i>This is my offering. My clothes are
my offering. This is my shame.</i>

458
00:31:40,147 --> 00:31:42,911
<i>My credentials! I'm ashamed!</i>

459
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:46,484
<i>And I love you, and I swear to God...</i>

460
00:31:54,194 --> 00:31:55,752
I guess that's it.

461
00:32:02,936 --> 00:32:04,233
When do we get Don?

462
00:32:04,838 --> 00:32:07,363
She said to try back in half an hour.

463
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:10,442
And how about the flights?
What's the story at O'Hare?

464
00:32:11,678 --> 00:32:14,306
- Closed four minutes ago.
- Shit.

465
00:32:15,682 --> 00:32:18,082
There is a foot of snow
in Detroit already.

466
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:20,516
Todd, could I get that coffee now?

467
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:26,853
Who is this guy they sent from New York?
Clayton? I never heard of him.

468
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:30,095
Michael Raymond Clayton.

469
00:32:30,264 --> 00:32:35,167
<i>Born September 9, 1959,
St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.</i>

470
00:32:35,335 --> 00:32:39,032
<i>Father is NYPD patrolman
Raymond Xavier Clayton.</i>

471
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:41,868
<i>Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.</i>

472
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:45,205
<i>Graduates Washingtonville Central
High School, Orange County, New York...</i>

473
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:47,006
<i>... in 1977.</i>

474
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:51,550
<i>Graduates St. John's University, 1980.
Fordham Law, '82.</i>

475
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:56,713
<i>'82 through '86, he's ADA with
the Queens district attorney's office.</i>

476
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,825
<i>1986, he's with
the Joint Manhattan-Queens...</i>

477
00:32:59,993 --> 00:33:01,927
<i>... Organized Crime Task Force.</i>

478
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:05,496
And then in 1990, he starts
at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

479
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,099
So he's a partner?

480
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:10,492
No. He's listed as special counsel.

481
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:12,696
Says he specializes in wills and trusts.

482
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:16,235
<i>He goes from criminal prosecution
to wills and trusts?</i>

483
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,776
<i>He's been there 17 years,
he's not a partner?</i>

484
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:22,609
<i>This is the guy they send?
Who is this guy?</i>

485
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:39,128
- Hi.
- Close the door.

486
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,593
All right. So nobody, none of you,
had any idea he was coming?

487
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:46,036
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?

488
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:49,767
We thought there was a settlement.
There's been some rumors.

489
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:54,539
Okay. Look, it's very simple.
Arthur has a chemical imbalance.

490
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:58,583
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's fallen behind on that.

491
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:01,243
He's on the mend.
He'll be fine in three or four days.

492
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:05,585
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear.
What happened here stays in this room.

493
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,728
This is not a piece of information
you wanna be out in front of.

494
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:12,195
Anybody has a problem with that,
I need to know right now.

495
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,698
All right.

496
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:17,400
We're stuck here overnight.

497
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:19,869
I'm gonna take him
home tomorrow if I can.

498
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,008
Who's in charge of
the deposition schedule?

499
00:34:22,175 --> 00:34:23,836
- I am.
- Where do we stand with that?

500
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:26,206
I guess it's on hold.
We didn't know what to do.

501
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,439
Nothing is on hold.
Keep doing what you were.

502
00:34:28,615 --> 00:34:30,879
Other side wants to talk,
they can call New York.

503
00:34:31,051 --> 00:34:34,111
- I need his briefcase.
- Arthur's? I don't... I didn't see it.

504
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:37,382
- He said it was in the room.
- It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.

505
00:34:37,758 --> 00:34:39,350
Find it.

506
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:49,632
So all these people, they all start
having these dreams, okay?

507
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:54,206
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?

508
00:34:54,374 --> 00:34:57,639
<i>Yeah. I think so. Like a...</i>

509
00:34:58,011 --> 00:34:59,876
<i>Like a special dream.</i>

510
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:04,609
Except this is like a whole bunch of people
having the same dream.

511
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:08,186
They're all having this dream
that they should go to this one place.

512
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:10,380
They don't know why or anything.

513
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:13,685
They just have this feeling
that they have to go there.

514
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,725
<i>That they've been summoned.</i>

515
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:17,124
That's the chapter.

516
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:20,266
Seriously, that's what it's called:
"Summons to Conquest."

517
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:21,731
<i>That's the title.</i>

518
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:27,568
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know
they're all having the same dream?

519
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:29,709
<i>No. That's what's so cool.</i>

520
00:35:30,243 --> 00:35:32,177
They all think it's just them.

521
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:36,407
That maybe they're, like, going crazy
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

522
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:38,710
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?

523
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:42,377
<i>No. It's real. It's really happening.</i>

524
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:46,185
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

525
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:52,058
Something larger than themselves
and they're not ready, are they...

526
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:54,029
...to hear it?

527
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:56,101
Yeah. But later they will.

528
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:59,102
So if you're gonna read it,
I don't wanna spoil it.

529
00:36:00,707 --> 00:36:02,538
What are you doing?
Who you talking to?

530
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,677
<i>I called my dad. It's a friend of his.</i>

531
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:08,110
<i>- Who?
- Mr. Edens. You don't know him.</i>

532
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:10,943
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- Henry, it's after 11.</i>

533
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:12,915
<i>I gotta get off now.</i>

534
00:36:13,086 --> 00:36:17,079
No. Wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The title.

535
00:36:17,691 --> 00:36:19,921
<i>The book is Realm and Conquest.</i>

536
00:36:20,093 --> 00:36:21,856
Realm and Conquest.

537
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:25,089
- It's Book One, with the red cover.
- Henry, give me the phone.

538
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:27,825
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?

539
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:33,105
Yeah. Yeah. Thank... Thank... Thank...
Thank you, Henry, thank you.

540
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,746
<i>Realm and Conquest. Thank you.</i>

541
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,995
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.

542
00:37:06,173 --> 00:37:07,640
- You're late.
- I know.

543
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,333
I'm sorry, it was more complicated
than we thought.

544
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,205
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.

545
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:14,540
- He's asleep.
- Well, wake him up.

546
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:16,979
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.

547
00:37:17,484 --> 00:37:20,510
Once he gets back
on his regular medication...

548
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:22,621
...then it's just a matter of time.

549
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:25,553
- Have you seen the video? The tape?
- I heard about it.

550
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,294
What happened after is worse.

551
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:32,364
This is in the parking lot, okay?
People running for their cars.

552
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:34,659
He's there in his socks, nothing else.

553
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,498
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will not sit with this sickness any longer.

554
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:41,470
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."

555
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:43,233
What does this mean?

556
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:45,201
I'm not sure.

557
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:48,006
You've been with him the whole evening.
What's he saying?

558
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:49,978
He wasn't really making much sense.

559
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,708
This is totally unacceptable.

560
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:54,820
This is a 3-billion-dollar
class-action lawsuit.

561
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:56,922
In the morning, I have to call my board.

562
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,652
I have to tell them that the architect
of our entire defense has been arrested...

563
00:38:01,828 --> 00:38:05,992
...for running naked in a snowstorm,
chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.

564
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:07,963
I understand.

565
00:38:09,035 --> 00:38:11,060
What sickness is he talking about?

566
00:38:11,238 --> 00:38:13,866
- I don't know. It could be anything.
- Well, give me one.

567
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,337
Frostbite.

568
00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:17,469
You think this is funny?

569
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:19,908
Look, his wife was sick
and she died last year.

570
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,540
His daughter doesn't talk to him.
He's all alone. All he does is your case.

571
00:38:24,718 --> 00:38:27,414
He skipped his pills.
He had a bad day. That's it.

572
00:38:27,587 --> 00:38:30,283
And you're somehow
the authority on this?

573
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:33,516
His last episode was eight years ago.
I was there.

574
00:38:33,693 --> 00:38:36,526
I helped bring him home.
I watched him get better. That's it.

575
00:38:36,696 --> 00:38:40,462
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy
because of his low-key regularity...

576
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:43,626
...you hired him because he's a killer,
because he's brilliant...

577
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:46,466
...because he's crazy enough
to grind away on this case...

578
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,404
...for six years without a break.
- We pay for his time.

579
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:51,601
I thought you wanted an explanation.

580
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:54,508
In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.

581
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:57,707
But, then, you know that.
Thank you, Michael.

582
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,683
He was mostly just quiet.

583
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:08,726
I heard him moving around,
I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.

584
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:11,386
- He took it?
- A deal's a deal, right?

585
00:39:11,565 --> 00:39:13,294
A super job, Elston.

586
00:39:13,466 --> 00:39:17,129
You get to New York, you need tickets
to the game or anything, you let me know.

587
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:18,737
I'll do that for sure.

588
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,752
Did you see her?

589
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:43,255
- Who?
- Anna.

590
00:39:43,797 --> 00:39:45,196
No.

591
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:49,926
No, I didn't see her.
She probably went back to the farm.

592
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:52,465
Well, we need her.

593
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:59,108
Marty, even then, and the rest of them,
they won't understand.

594
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,707
Well, if anybody can explain it to them,
it's you, Arthur.

595
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:07,613
No, they're lost.

596
00:40:07,787 --> 00:40:10,847
- They have what they want.
- Let it go, man.

597
00:40:11,024 --> 00:40:12,855
This what you wanted?

598
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:15,951
To be a janitor?

599
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:19,489
Live like this? All this?

600
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,961
Do what you do?

601
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:24,769
It can't be.

602
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:26,663
It's...

603
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,469
It's a burden,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

604
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:33,238
That's... That's how it feels.

605
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,879
Well, I know that
we've been summoned.

606
00:40:40,654 --> 00:40:42,485
Get some sleep.

607
00:40:58,371 --> 00:40:59,395
<i>Hello?</i>

608
00:40:59,572 --> 00:41:03,372
Yes. Hi, I'm looking for Verne?

609
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:05,742
<i>You have a number?</i>

610
00:41:05,912 --> 00:41:09,006
Don Jeffries gave me the number.
He said I could call at any time.

611
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:11,047
<i>No. The account number.</i>

612
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:15,415
The code? I do.
I have it right here. One moment.

613
00:41:17,357 --> 00:41:19,348
Excuse me one moment.

614
00:41:19,826 --> 00:41:23,421
It's right here. 12-BKR-6.

615
00:41:23,596 --> 00:41:25,655
12-BKR-6.

616
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,091
Am I speaking with Verne?

617
00:41:30,203 --> 00:41:31,500
<i>It's Mr. Verne.</i>

618
00:41:31,671 --> 00:41:35,004
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so late.

619
00:41:35,175 --> 00:41:37,166
Don said that I could...

620
00:41:38,878 --> 00:41:41,108
I'm not exactly sure how this works.

621
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:43,272
<i>Do you have e-mail
at your current location?</i>

622
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,678
I do.

623
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:47,012
<i>- Are you alone?
- I am.</i>

624
00:41:47,787 --> 00:41:52,019
<i>Okay, I'm gonna upload you
a little encryption package we like to use.</i>

625
00:41:52,192 --> 00:41:53,591
<i>It's pretty self-explanatory.</i>

626
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,057
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

627
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:58,197
<i>But you have to give me a minute
to get to my desk. Hold on.</i>

628
00:41:58,365 --> 00:42:00,060
Okay. Thank you.

629
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:26,986
<i>What I was wondering is...</i>

630
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,993
...I have an option on the lease
for six more years.

631
00:42:30,163 --> 00:42:32,825
I was wondering if there's any way
I could lay that off.

632
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:35,991
Is the lease worth anything?

633
00:42:39,472 --> 00:42:41,963
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's...

634
00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:45,139
The fixtures are gone, but there's...

635
00:42:46,846 --> 00:42:50,043
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen,
it's a great space.

636
00:42:51,618 --> 00:42:53,176
But there's a...

637
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,584
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.

638
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:04,455
Okay, yeah, I will.

639
00:43:05,098 --> 00:43:06,622
All right. Thanks.

640
00:43:16,976 --> 00:43:18,568
Come on, Arthur.

641
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,478
Arthur!

642
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,042
Arthur, open the door.

643
00:43:28,621 --> 00:43:30,486
Arthur, open the door!

644
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:35,726
Arthur, open the goddamn door!

645
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,292
Arthur, op...!

646
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:41,192
Open the fucking door!

647
00:43:47,574 --> 00:43:49,041
Arthur!

648
00:43:49,843 --> 00:43:52,471
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking...!

649
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:04,116
Arthur?!

650
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:17,266
- Mr. Verne, hey.
- Hey, Danny.

651
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:19,701
You guys are early.
I was pulling the other bags.

652
00:44:19,873 --> 00:44:22,740
You can put them back.
There's been a change of plans, sorry.

653
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:24,809
- We ready?
- Yep.

654
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:31,007
For chrissake.

655
00:44:31,184 --> 00:44:33,049
Don Jeffries signed this?

656
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,080
That's really his signature?

657
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,224
Where's the original?

658
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:43,454
We had a warehouse fire five years ago.
We lost a number of documents.

659
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:52,436
What the hell is this doing
in Arthur's bag?

660
00:44:53,072 --> 00:44:54,596
Well, I don't know, Marty.

661
00:44:54,774 --> 00:44:58,733
That's something I was hoping
you might be able to tell me.

662
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:05,075
What are we looking for?

663
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:09,449
If it says U/North, pull it aside.
Anything that says U/North.

664
00:45:10,924 --> 00:45:12,414
What a mess this is.

665
00:45:17,063 --> 00:45:18,291
I want all this...

666
00:45:19,232 --> 00:45:23,328
...everything here, I want it all packed up
and sent up to the house.

667
00:45:24,437 --> 00:45:25,836
Any luck, Michael?

668
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:30,669
He booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3,
got out at West Fourth Street...

669
00:45:30,843 --> 00:45:32,811
...tipped the driver 100 bucks
and walked away.

670
00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:34,173
Did you try his apartment?

671
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:35,507
- He moved.
- I know.

672
00:45:35,682 --> 00:45:38,048
It's a loft. No doorman.
I rang, nobody answered.

673
00:45:38,218 --> 00:45:40,880
- I called, I got the machine.
- So he could be anywhere.

674
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:44,046
Arthur downtown is not a good idea.
Some goddamn loft.

675
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:46,954
- Where's his daughter?
- I don't know. Spain, India.

676
00:45:47,126 --> 00:45:50,254
Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.

677
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:52,261
Barry's taking over on U/North.

678
00:45:52,432 --> 00:45:54,229
We got a lot of groveling to do.

679
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,493
You didn't exactly charm Karen Crowder.

680
00:45:56,669 --> 00:45:57,897
I was punting.

681
00:45:58,071 --> 00:46:00,733
You gotta saddle up here
and get things under control.

682
00:46:00,907 --> 00:46:01,896
Saddle up?

683
00:46:02,075 --> 00:46:05,135
He needs to be under a doctor's care.
He needs to be admitted.

684
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,643
- Where?
- Does that really matter?

685
00:46:07,814 --> 00:46:10,715
Michael, U/North needs to know
he's under control.

686
00:46:10,883 --> 00:46:14,250
He's in a facility. They've been shook up.
They need to be reassured.

687
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,615
- It's not gonna be that easy.
- Why the hell not?

688
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:20,589
Because the laws in New York are
pretty tough on involuntary commitment.

689
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,318
Did you see this fucking tape?

690
00:46:22,495 --> 00:46:25,191
I'm not arguing with you, Barry.
I'm telling you how it is.

691
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,493
You know what, guys?
We got 600 lawyers in this place.

692
00:46:28,668 --> 00:46:32,160
Why don't we find out which one knows
about psychiatric-commitment statutes?

693
00:46:32,338 --> 00:46:35,000
I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.

694
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:48,678
<i>I'm at the door. We're good to go.</i>

695
00:46:49,856 --> 00:46:53,519
Yeah, roger that.
Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?

696
00:46:53,693 --> 00:46:55,854
Every five minutes, copy that.

697
00:47:31,964 --> 00:47:34,057
<i>Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.</i>

698
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:37,498
<i>If you wish to leave a message,
please do so after the tone.</i>

699
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:40,902
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone.</i>

700
00:47:41,074 --> 00:47:45,477
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone
and talk to me.</i>

701
00:47:47,313 --> 00:47:50,282
<i>No? Not gonna do it?</i>

702
00:47:51,084 --> 00:47:54,178
What happened yesterday morning,
forget it. It doesn't matter.

703
00:47:54,354 --> 00:47:56,413
Someday you and I
are gonna laugh about it.

704
00:47:56,589 --> 00:47:58,056
But you gotta call me back.

705
00:47:58,224 --> 00:48:00,624
You gotta call me back soon, Arthur.

706
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,894
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

707
00:48:03,062 --> 00:48:06,054
<i>Because you said it yourself.
Part of this is definitely madness.</i>

708
00:48:06,232 --> 00:48:08,598
<i>And there's a chemical part.
We both know it.</i>

709
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:10,993
<i>But if you're willing to start with that...</i>

710
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:14,298
<i>... then I'm more than willing to
meet you halfway and say, yes...</i>

711
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,932
...this situation sucks.
This case sucks. U/North sucks.

712
00:48:18,111 --> 00:48:20,705
We can start with that.
All right, Arthur? You hear me?

713
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,541
You're right about what we are.

714
00:48:23,249 --> 00:48:26,685
<i>I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying
that your behavior is out of control.</i>

715
00:48:26,853 --> 00:48:28,445
<i>But I'm telling you you're right.</i>

716
00:48:28,621 --> 00:48:32,079
You called it. We're janitors, I get it.

717
00:48:34,026 --> 00:48:35,960
But we came to this, Arthur.

718
00:48:36,896 --> 00:48:39,956
<i>We made decisions.
It didn't happen overnight.</i>

719
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:44,229
You can't just suddenly stop and say,
"That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."

720
00:48:45,171 --> 00:48:46,968
<i>Arthur. Come on.</i>

721
00:48:48,608 --> 00:48:50,735
Goddamn it,
pick up the phone and talk to me.

722
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:53,242
Because whatever else
you think is so important...

723
00:48:53,413 --> 00:48:56,143
...you better let me help you,
because I'm telling you...

724
00:48:56,315 --> 00:49:00,513
...janitor to janitor, I don't see
anybody else with a broom on the horizon.

725
00:49:00,686 --> 00:49:03,120
It's me, buddy. I'm the...

726
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:07,282
<i>Mailbox is full.
Your message cannot be recorded.</i>

727
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:10,255
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. Is Anna there?</i>

728
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:11,788
Hang on.

729
00:50:15,194 --> 00:50:16,718
<i>Anna!</i>

730
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:20,824
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

731
00:50:23,436 --> 00:50:25,131
<i>- Anna!
- Anna!</i>

732
00:50:26,105 --> 00:50:28,403
<i>Anna, you've got a phone call!</i>

733
00:50:31,043 --> 00:50:33,136
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

734
00:50:44,524 --> 00:50:45,616
Hello?

735
00:50:46,092 --> 00:50:48,219
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.

736
00:50:48,394 --> 00:50:50,954
<i>- Hey.
- Did you get some sleep?</i>

737
00:50:51,397 --> 00:50:52,955
<i>I guess.</i>

738
00:50:53,132 --> 00:50:55,100
<i>Did you think about what we said?</i>

739
00:50:55,268 --> 00:50:57,896
<i>- Yeah.
- You didn't tell anybody, did you?</i>

740
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:02,598
No. My sister's spying on me,
but that's normal.

741
00:51:02,775 --> 00:51:05,471
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.

742
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,045
<i>I know. I know. It's just...</i>

743
00:51:09,181 --> 00:51:12,981
...there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.

744
00:51:13,819 --> 00:51:15,946
Why are you choosing me?

745
00:51:17,256 --> 00:51:19,622
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?

746
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:21,350
<i>That's for sure.</i>

747
00:51:21,527 --> 00:51:23,495
I mean, does it...?
Does it really matter?

748
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:27,827
<i>I mean, isn't it what we wait for?
To meet someone? And they're...</i>

749
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,297
<i>They're like a lens...</i>

750
00:51:29,468 --> 00:51:33,131
...and suddenly you're looking
through them and everything changes...

751
00:51:33,306 --> 00:51:35,297
...and nothing can ever be
the same again.

752
00:51:35,474 --> 00:51:37,135
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

753
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,040
It's for me, okay? I get calls too.

754
00:51:40,212 --> 00:51:41,645
That guy?

755
00:51:41,814 --> 00:51:45,306
Same guy. Same guy.

756
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:47,317
Sorry.

757
00:51:48,354 --> 00:51:52,654
No. That's... That's okay.
My mother used to listen to my calls.

758
00:51:52,825 --> 00:51:55,521
<i>She can't believe I can do anything
on my own.</i>

759
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,162
Well, that'll change.

760
00:51:57,897 --> 00:51:59,194
<i>I guess.</i>

761
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:02,391
<i>Yeah, but, see,
that's something we can show her.</i>

762
00:52:02,568 --> 00:52:05,696
<i>That you can do something.</i>

763
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:08,999
<i>That we could... We could do that together
if you want. I mean...</i>

764
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:11,439
<i>I mean that I can help you do that.</i>

765
00:52:12,378 --> 00:52:15,006
I can get you 12 by Monday.

766
00:52:15,181 --> 00:52:17,240
Twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.

767
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:18,883
How do you figure that?

768
00:52:19,051 --> 00:52:22,612
They look at 75 and they look at you
and they wonder what the problem is.

769
00:52:22,788 --> 00:52:24,881
You say 12.
That's gonna make people nervous.

770
00:52:25,057 --> 00:52:27,992
This was the day before yesterday.
Let me get my ducks in order.

771
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,388
What's the car worth?

772
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:31,757
It's a lease. It's the firm's.

773
00:52:31,931 --> 00:52:35,833
So? You go to the bank.
You've got the apartment. You refinance.

774
00:52:36,002 --> 00:52:38,630
I can't. I did that three months ago.

775
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:41,267
Are you back at the tables?

776
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,375
Like I need that kind of action.
I don't have enough going on.

777
00:52:47,546 --> 00:52:49,571
I hope you're kidding.

778
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:53,810
If he finds out you're playing cards with
his money, there's no dialogue after that.

779
00:52:55,421 --> 00:52:57,412
Do everyone a favor.

780
00:52:57,623 --> 00:53:02,026
Get out the treasure map
and start digging.

781
00:53:02,795 --> 00:53:04,285
You got a week.

782
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:08,429
- Hey, Michael. How are you?
- Hi, Cindy. I'm good.

783
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:11,900
Come in. He's been on the phone
all morning. What else is new?

784
00:53:12,071 --> 00:53:14,096
I am trying to get him out
in 15 minutes.

785
00:53:14,273 --> 00:53:16,707
- Is he upstairs?
- He's taken over the living room.

786
00:53:16,876 --> 00:53:18,776
What are you guys doing?
Get down here.

787
00:53:18,944 --> 00:53:23,711
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on
these kids, make sure they're downstairs.

788
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:39,720
Marty?

789
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:44,834
You know what he's doing?
He's making their case.

790
00:53:45,504 --> 00:53:48,371
I'm going through his files here,
I'm reading this...

791
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:50,406
...he's building a case against U/North.

792
00:53:50,576 --> 00:53:52,567
- Nobody's gonna let him do that.
- Let him?

793
00:53:52,745 --> 00:53:54,144
Who the hell's gonna stop him?

794
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,342
You know what I just heard?
He's calling these plaintiffs.

795
00:53:57,516 --> 00:54:01,714
This woman from the deposition,
he's calling these people now.

796
00:54:01,887 --> 00:54:04,822
He's got these discovery documents.
This is a fucking nightmare.

797
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:08,551
I tried him. Can't even leave a message.
He's got the machine jammed up.

798
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:11,253
- Is that his briefcase?
- Yeah.

799
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,628
- Why?
- We've been looking for it.

800
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:17,326
I don't know. It came up here
with all the other stuff from his office.

801
00:54:17,503 --> 00:54:21,234
You can't believe
the crap he's got in here.

802
00:54:22,274 --> 00:54:23,298
Listen, Marty...

803
00:54:25,277 --> 00:54:27,609
...I'm in a bind here.

804
00:54:28,781 --> 00:54:31,511
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.

805
00:54:32,685 --> 00:54:35,017
- I thought you were done with that.
- It's not that.

806
00:54:35,187 --> 00:54:38,020
It's not the cards. It's none of that.
It's the restaurant.

807
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:39,782
Eighty thousand.

808
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:41,426
I'm sorry to jump you like this.

809
00:54:41,594 --> 00:54:44,358
I've been trying to get a meeting
with you for two weeks.

810
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:48,430
And I know about the merger,
whether I'm supposed to or not.

811
00:54:48,834 --> 00:54:50,529
There's nothing final on the merger.

812
00:54:50,703 --> 00:54:53,638
Well, that's why I'm asking you now.
You're my meal ticket.

813
00:54:53,806 --> 00:54:56,468
Once you're out,
it's me and Barry with strangers...

814
00:54:56,642 --> 00:54:58,542
...and I'm trying to explain what I do.

815
00:54:58,711 --> 00:55:01,771
Everybody knows how valuable you are.
Everybody who needs to know.

816
00:55:01,947 --> 00:55:03,608
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.

817
00:55:03,783 --> 00:55:06,479
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years
and I got no equity.

818
00:55:06,652 --> 00:55:08,244
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.

819
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,445
Nobody told you to
go into the bar business.

820
00:55:10,623 --> 00:55:13,183
I only opened it so I'd have
something else, a way out.

821
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,020
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

822
00:55:15,194 --> 00:55:18,220
How many times did I ask you
to put me back on a litigation team?

823
00:55:18,397 --> 00:55:20,058
- How many?
- Anybody can go to court.

824
00:55:20,232 --> 00:55:21,460
You think that's special?

825
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:24,296
- I was good at it.
- Wonderful. So are a lot of people.

826
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:28,137
At this, what you do, you're great.

827
00:55:28,307 --> 00:55:32,573
For chrissakes, you got something
everybody wants. You have a niche.

828
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:35,737
You made a place.
You made a niche for yourself.

829
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:39,976
And if it's nostalgia..."You should've seen
me when I was a DA back in Queens."

830
00:55:40,152 --> 00:55:43,553
- Let me give you a serious piece of advice:
Leave it there.

831
00:55:43,722 --> 00:55:47,715
God forbid you're not as good as
you remember. I've seen that happen too.

832
00:55:48,594 --> 00:55:51,119
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?

833
00:55:51,697 --> 00:55:54,996
So this is what? I give you the loan
or you don't help out with Arthur?

834
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:56,759
- I never said that.
- No?

835
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,267
Maybe you should have.

836
00:55:58,437 --> 00:56:03,101
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but this, this is cancer.

837
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:06,438
This is something, we don't get it
reined in and cleaned up soon...

838
00:56:06,612 --> 00:56:08,739
...everything's vulnerable. Everything.

839
00:56:09,548 --> 00:56:12,881
- What are you telling me?
- That I'm counting on you.

840
00:56:13,252 --> 00:56:17,211
I'm telling you that by this time next week,
Arthur will be under control...

841
00:56:17,389 --> 00:56:20,950
...and everybody who needs to will have
been reminded of your infinite value.

842
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,423
Jesus, Marty.

843
00:56:22,695 --> 00:56:24,094
Hey.

844
00:56:24,263 --> 00:56:26,288
When did you get so fucking delicate?

845
00:56:27,399 --> 00:56:28,957
I'm late.

846
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,667
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene
and get the cops to help you?

847
00:57:11,844 --> 00:57:13,869
It's not that kind of a problem.

848
00:57:15,514 --> 00:57:17,914
- How much longer are we doing this?
- I don't know.

849
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:33,729
If he comes back to get his car,
you call that number and let me know.

850
00:57:33,899 --> 00:57:37,027
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
- Okay. You're welcome.

851
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:47,402
If we're not gonna get to the movie,
why don't you just say so?

852
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:50,343
- What?
- I wanna go home.

853
00:57:50,516 --> 00:57:52,313
Come on, Henry.

854
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:56,710
Hold up!

855
00:57:59,758 --> 00:58:01,623
Stay in the car. Lock the door.

856
00:58:03,262 --> 00:58:06,231
Arthur! Arthur!

857
00:58:06,398 --> 00:58:07,729
Wait up.

858
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:11,968
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.

859
00:58:13,372 --> 00:58:16,102
- Making a delivery?
- No, no, no.

860
00:58:16,942 --> 00:58:19,570
Very funny. No, nothing like that.

861
00:58:19,745 --> 00:58:23,340
Here, take one, please. Really.
It's... It's still warm.

862
00:58:23,515 --> 00:58:25,142
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

863
00:58:29,188 --> 00:58:30,917
So welcome home.

864
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:35,026
I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.

865
00:58:35,194 --> 00:58:37,560
I was beginning to feel
a little overwhelmed.

866
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,561
- But you're feeling better now?
- Yeah.

867
00:58:39,732 --> 00:58:42,223
- Much better, definitely.
- Not enough to call me back.

868
00:58:42,401 --> 00:58:45,632
Well, I was trying
to gather my thoughts...

869
00:58:45,804 --> 00:58:49,399
...before I called you,
and that's what I was doing.

870
00:58:50,042 --> 00:58:51,441
And how's that going?

871
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,078
Yes, it's good, very good. I just...

872
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:59,784
Well, I just need to make my thoughts
a little bit more precise. That's...

873
00:58:59,952 --> 00:59:01,249
That's my goal.

874
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,787
As good as this feels,
you know where it goes.

875
00:59:04,957 --> 00:59:06,356
No. No. You're wrong.

876
00:59:06,525 --> 00:59:09,619
What makes this feel good
is that I don't know where it goes.

877
00:59:10,796 --> 00:59:13,959
How do I talk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?

878
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:18,661
Like a child? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?

879
00:59:18,837 --> 00:59:22,603
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.

880
00:59:22,775 --> 00:59:25,539
- Well, I hear everything.
- Then hear this.

881
00:59:25,978 --> 00:59:29,937
You need help.
Before this goes too far, you need help.

882
00:59:30,115 --> 00:59:31,343
You got great cards here.

883
00:59:31,517 --> 00:59:34,850
If you keep your clothes on, you can
do any goddamn thing you want.

884
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:38,251
You want out, you're out.
You wanna bake bread, go with God.

885
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:41,120
There's only one wrong answer
in this whole goddamn pile...

886
00:59:41,293 --> 00:59:43,056
...and you've got
your arms around it.

887
00:59:43,228 --> 00:59:46,527
- Well, I said I was sorry.
- You thought the hotel was overwhelming?

888
00:59:46,698 --> 00:59:49,258
You piss on this case,
they'll cut you off at the knees.

889
00:59:49,435 --> 00:59:52,700
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm covering for you.

890
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:56,363
I'm telling them everything's fine.
You're fine. Everybody's cool.

891
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:59,773
I'm out running this "price of genius" story
to anybody who'll listen.

892
00:59:59,945 --> 01:00:04,177
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...

893
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:06,214
...messing with documents
and whatever else.

894
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:08,910
- How can you know that?
- They're gonna take everything.

895
01:00:09,088 --> 01:00:12,580
Your partnership, your equity.
They're gonna pull your license.

896
01:00:12,758 --> 01:00:14,919
- How do you know I called Anna?
- Marty told me.

897
01:00:15,094 --> 01:00:18,860
- Well, how does he know?
- I don't know. I don't give a shit!

898
01:00:22,568 --> 01:00:24,502
- You're tapping my phone.
- Jesus, Arthur.

899
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:26,535
Then explain it.
Tell me how Marty knows!

900
01:00:26,705 --> 01:00:31,574
Because you're chasing a girl through
a parking lot with your dick hanging out.

901
01:00:31,743 --> 01:00:34,576
You think she didn't get off the phone
and dial her attorney?

902
01:00:34,746 --> 01:00:36,611
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.

903
01:00:36,782 --> 01:00:39,774
Really? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

904
01:00:41,253 --> 01:00:45,553
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.

905
01:00:45,724 --> 01:00:47,248
I'll help you think this through.

906
01:00:47,426 --> 01:00:49,656
I'll find somebody to help you
think it through.

907
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:53,992
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

908
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:58,830
Michael, I have great affection for you.

909
01:00:59,004 --> 01:01:03,304
You lead a very rich and interesting life,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

910
01:01:03,909 --> 01:01:05,740
If you wanted to have me committed...

911
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:09,779
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

912
01:01:09,948 --> 01:01:12,610
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

913
01:01:12,784 --> 01:01:14,752
...would have had
jurisdictional relevance.

914
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,320
I have no criminal record
in the state of New York.

915
01:01:17,756 --> 01:01:23,023
And the single determining criterion
for involuntary incarceration is danger.

916
01:01:23,195 --> 01:01:26,562
Is the defendant a danger
to himself or others?

917
01:01:26,732 --> 01:01:29,428
You think you got the horses for that?

918
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:32,331
Well, good luck and God bless.
But I tell you this:

919
01:01:33,605 --> 01:01:37,735
The last place you want to see me
is in court.

920
01:01:38,577 --> 01:01:40,408
I'm not the enemy.

921
01:01:40,913 --> 01:01:42,938
Then who are you?

922
01:01:55,594 --> 01:01:57,494
<i>We find the seed.</i>

923
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,593
<i>We shape the soil.</i>

924
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:08,632
<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

925
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:12,743
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

926
01:02:24,489 --> 01:02:26,218
<i>We find the seed.</i>

927
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,194
<i>We shape the soil.</i>

928
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:37,435
<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

929
01:02:39,638 --> 01:02:40,866
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

930
01:02:59,157 --> 01:03:00,954
What the hell is he doing?

931
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,239
<i>We find the seed.</i>

932
01:03:22,314 --> 01:03:25,545
<i>You've reached the voicemail of
Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.</i>

933
01:03:25,717 --> 01:03:27,582
<i>Please leave your message
after the tone.</i>

934
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,547
Yes!

935
01:03:29,888 --> 01:03:33,756
Here we are, all together.
Is everyone listening?

936
01:03:33,925 --> 01:03:37,361
<i>This is the moment you've been waiting for.
A very special piece of paper.</i>

937
01:03:37,529 --> 01:03:41,056
<i>So let's have a big, paranoid,
malignant round of applause...</i>

938
01:03:41,233 --> 01:03:46,500
<i>... for United Northfield Culcitate
Internal Research Memorandum 229.</i>

939
01:03:46,672 --> 01:03:49,937
<i>June 19th, 1991.</i>

940
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,835
"Conclusion:

941
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:54,672
The unanticipated market growth
for Culcitate...

942
01:03:54,846 --> 01:04:00,079
...by small farms in colder climates
demands immediate cost-benefit analysis."

943
01:04:00,952 --> 01:04:03,921
<i>Would you guys like
a little bit of legal advice?</i>

944
01:04:04,089 --> 01:04:06,956
Never let a scientist
use the words "unanticipated"...

945
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:10,219
...and "immediate"
in the same sentence.

946
01:04:10,395 --> 01:04:12,226
Okay? Okay.

947
01:04:12,397 --> 01:04:14,831
<i>"In-house field studies
have indicated...</i>

948
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,733
<i>... that small short-season farms dependent
on well water for human consumption...</i>

949
01:04:19,905 --> 01:04:24,069
<i>... are at risk for toxic
particulate concentrations at levels...</i>

950
01:04:24,242 --> 01:04:28,144
...significant enough to cause
serious human tissue damage."

951
01:04:28,313 --> 01:04:30,713
Well, this is a long way of saying that...

952
01:04:30,882 --> 01:04:34,215
...you don't even have to leave your house
to be killed by our product.

953
01:04:34,386 --> 01:04:36,445
We'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.

954
01:04:36,988 --> 01:04:39,752
<i>- "Culcitate's great market advantage...
- Give me the phone.</i>

955
01:04:39,925 --> 01:04:42,826
<i>... that it is tasteless, colorless

956

<i>... has the potential
to mask and intensify...</i>

957
01:04:45,831 --> 01:04:48,391
...these potentially lethal exposures."

958
01:04:48,567 --> 01:04:50,364
Now, I love this.

959
01:04:50,535 --> 01:04:52,435
Not only is this a great product...

960
01:04:52,604 --> 01:04:56,301
...it is a superb cancer delivery system.

961
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:59,205
"Chemical modifications
of the Culcitate product...

962
01:04:59,378 --> 01:05:03,576
<i>... the addition of a detector molecule,
such as an odorant or colorant...</i>

963
01:05:03,749 --> 01:05:08,618
<i>... would require a top-down redesign
of the Culcitate manufacturing process.</i>

964
01:05:08,854 --> 01:05:11,880
<i>These costs,
while assumed to be significant...</i>

965
01:05:12,057 --> 01:05:13,854
<i>... were not summarized here. "</i>

966
01:05:14,025 --> 01:05:15,959
Which, loosely translated, means:

967
01:05:16,128 --> 01:05:20,189
"It's going to cost a fortune to go back
on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...

968
01:05:20,365 --> 01:05:23,493
...so could someone else
please make the decision?"

969
01:05:23,802 --> 01:05:27,363
<i>"Clearly, the release of
these internal research documents...</i>

970
01:05:27,539 --> 01:05:30,235
<i>... would compromise
the effective marketing of Culcitate...</i>

971
01:05:30,909 --> 01:05:34,106
...and must be kept within
the protective confines...

972
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:37,373
...of United-Northfield's
trade secret language."

973
01:05:38,683 --> 01:05:43,279
<i>You don't need me
to tell you what that means.</i>

974
01:05:43,555 --> 01:05:44,852
<i>Goodbye.</i>

975
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,085
- It seemed to warrant my coming to...
- Yes.

976
01:05:52,898 --> 01:05:54,525
You have to contain this.

977
01:05:56,268 --> 01:05:58,498
- Contain?
- Right.

978
01:05:59,037 --> 01:06:01,096
Well, that's my question.

979
01:06:01,873 --> 01:06:06,207
What are the...?
What's the option that we're looking at?

980
01:06:06,378 --> 01:06:08,209
Along those lines.

981
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,406
You're talking about the paper, the data?
I don't...

982
01:06:12,317 --> 01:06:16,754
Well, I'm wondering
if there is some other option.

983
01:06:16,922 --> 01:06:18,787
I mean something I'm not thinking of?

984
01:06:19,524 --> 01:06:21,492
We deal in absolutes.

985
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,561
Okay. I understand that. I do.

986
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:30,167
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer.
We try, we do what we can.

987
01:06:30,335 --> 01:06:32,166
Well, the other way?

988
01:06:34,206 --> 01:06:36,071
Is the other way.

989
01:06:39,978 --> 01:06:42,469
- Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this.
- No.

990
01:06:42,647 --> 01:06:46,139
This is nothing to do with Don. He's busy.
This is nothing to do with Don.

991
01:06:53,091 --> 01:06:54,888
Do you think it's doable?

992
01:06:56,361 --> 01:06:59,626
Yeah. We have some good ideas.
You say move, we move.

993
01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:02,892
If the ideas don't look so good,
we back off, reassess...

994
01:07:03,068 --> 01:07:04,399
Okay.

995
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,932
Is that, "Okay, you understand,"
or "Okay, proceed"?

996
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,478
Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?

997
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:21,778
Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?

998
01:07:21,953 --> 01:07:24,148
- Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9?
- Come on.

999
01:07:24,322 --> 01:07:26,756
Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!

1000
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,491
Come on.

1001
01:07:29,661 --> 01:07:31,322
Go on, Dad, make a wish.

1002
01:07:31,496 --> 01:07:33,430
If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.

1003
01:07:34,232 --> 01:07:36,894
You're a maniac. Unbelievable.

1004
01:07:37,068 --> 01:07:39,002
Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?

1005
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,304
All right, Eddie.

1006
01:07:43,475 --> 01:07:46,774
Now, I did not make this myself
and I don't wanna hear any complaints.

1007
01:07:46,945 --> 01:07:48,378
Happy birthday.

1008
01:07:48,547 --> 01:07:50,310
You have time for cake?

1009
01:07:50,815 --> 01:07:53,079
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.

1010
01:07:53,251 --> 01:07:54,240
You going in?

1011
01:07:55,987 --> 01:07:58,148
- I'm late already.
- Shit.

1012
01:07:58,323 --> 01:07:59,722
You're not both running out?

1013
01:07:59,891 --> 01:08:01,654
I got a situation.

1014
01:08:01,826 --> 01:08:03,487
- You can't hang?
- You're going in.

1015
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:06,028
- Yeah. I got a shift.
- So do I.

1016
01:08:06,197 --> 01:08:09,166
Come on, man.
You haven't been up here in months.

1017
01:08:09,334 --> 01:08:12,269
If you go back now, Mickey,
Henry's staying here.

1018
01:08:12,437 --> 01:08:14,803
Good. You can drive him home.

1019
01:08:14,973 --> 01:08:16,406
Just stay for an hour.

1020
01:08:16,975 --> 01:08:18,772
The girls did all this stuff.

1021
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,077
He'll be asleep by then.

1022
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:27,043
Timmy's been calling me.

1023
01:08:31,022 --> 01:08:32,546
He's afraid to talk to you.

1024
01:08:32,724 --> 01:08:33,850
He should be.

1025
01:08:34,025 --> 01:08:36,619
- It closed out bad, right?
- Is that what he told you?

1026
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:38,763
The kids are freaking out.

1027
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:40,495
The in-laws are freaking out.

1028
01:08:41,466 --> 01:08:44,492
Pammy can't stop crying long enough
to start freaking out.

1029
01:08:44,669 --> 01:08:48,332
- She took him back.
- So what? Fuck her and the kids?

1030
01:08:48,506 --> 01:08:51,134
No. Fuck Timmy.
And nothing's closed, okay?

1031
01:08:51,309 --> 01:08:55,006
I sold everything and we're still short.
So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.

1032
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,238
I got my hands full.

1033
01:08:56,681 --> 01:09:00,117
If it was you, he'd be in traction.

1034
01:09:01,386 --> 01:09:03,411
Yeah, he's sick, all right?

1035
01:09:04,589 --> 01:09:07,820
- He's sick. It's a sickness.
- There's a fresh perspective.

1036
01:09:07,993 --> 01:09:12,259
I've seen a lot of people falling off
the wagon lately. It's going around.

1037
01:09:13,331 --> 01:09:15,026
Is that pointed at me?

1038
01:09:17,335 --> 01:09:20,065
When do I see you?
How do I know what you're up to?

1039
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,604
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.

1040
01:09:22,774 --> 01:09:25,265
I haven't been in a card room
in 10 months.

1041
01:09:25,443 --> 01:09:28,503
I gambled on the bar.
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.

1042
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,238
That was my big play, all right?

1043
01:09:30,415 --> 01:09:34,249
I put up my walk-away money
and it's gone and I'm scrambling.

1044
01:09:34,419 --> 01:09:37,013
Okay. Okay.

1045
01:09:38,056 --> 01:09:40,024
Cool down. I hear you.

1046
01:09:44,929 --> 01:09:46,988
I'd be pissed off too.

1047
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:54,898
Just hang for an hour.

1048
01:09:55,807 --> 01:09:57,866
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1049
01:10:32,175 --> 01:10:34,575
Ready? And, lift.

1050
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:37,076
Ready and go.

1051
01:11:01,037 --> 01:11:02,095
Wipe.

1052
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,180
You better hit it.

1053
01:11:46,749 --> 01:11:48,114
We're good.

1054
01:12:22,451 --> 01:12:25,579
Okay, I found it. That's his number.

1055
01:12:25,755 --> 01:12:27,780
Dr. Mullien.
See if you have any more luck.

1056
01:12:27,957 --> 01:12:29,891
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.

1057
01:12:30,059 --> 01:12:33,153
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles.
I can pull the file...

1058
01:12:33,329 --> 01:12:35,194
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.

1059
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:37,628
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.

1060
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,394
- Take a night off, Mickey.
- You look tired.

1061
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,561
- I'm okay. See you soon.
- Be good.

1062
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:44,968
- All right. Bye.
- Bye, Hen.

1063
01:12:45,141 --> 01:12:46,836
- Bye, Pop.
- Bye.

1064
01:12:56,886 --> 01:12:59,252
- Uncle Timmy, hey!
- How you doing, Henry?

1065
01:12:59,422 --> 01:13:00,753
Henry, get in the car.

1066
01:13:03,426 --> 01:13:04,859
Good to see you, Hen.

1067
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:09,526
- What do you want?
- I've been sober eight days now.

1068
01:13:10,533 --> 01:13:14,196
Been back at the meetings.
I wanted you to know.

1069
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:15,997
In front of the kid?

1070
01:13:16,172 --> 01:13:19,664
Mickey, please.
I know how bad I did, I swear.

1071
01:13:20,676 --> 01:13:24,271
I don't know how to make it right again.
It's all I think about.

1072
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,078
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

1073
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:30,709
Get Stephanie her tires back.

1074
01:13:35,992 --> 01:13:38,961
- Is he crying?
- I don't know.

1075
01:13:39,128 --> 01:13:40,959
Because of drugs, right?

1076
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:42,927
That and everything else.

1077
01:14:14,297 --> 01:14:15,764
What?

1078
01:14:18,034 --> 01:14:19,399
Your Uncle Timmy...

1079
01:14:20,069 --> 01:14:25,564
...and I mean this, on his best day,
is never as tough as you.

1080
01:14:26,609 --> 01:14:29,772
I'm not talking about crying
or the drugs or anything.

1081
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:33,039
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart.
You understand me?

1082
01:14:34,116 --> 01:14:37,984
And all his charming bullshit,
this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...

1083
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:40,349
...and I know you love him,
and I know why.

1084
01:14:40,523 --> 01:14:42,320
But when you see him like that...

1085
01:14:42,491 --> 01:14:45,255
...you don't have to worry.
That's not how it'll be for you.

1086
01:14:45,428 --> 01:14:47,988
You're not gonna be someone
that goes through life...

1087
01:14:48,164 --> 01:14:51,759
...wondering why shit keeps
falling out of the sky around them.

1088
01:14:51,934 --> 01:14:54,334
I know that. I know it.

1089
01:14:54,503 --> 01:14:55,800
Okay?

1090
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:04,206
I see it every time I look at you.
I see it right now.

1091
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:09,245
I don't know where you got it from,
but you got it.

1092
01:15:10,953 --> 01:15:12,284
Okay?

1093
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:26,798
Hello?

1094
01:15:36,812 --> 01:15:40,714
The neighbors came by.
They're renovating the loft downstairs.

1095
01:15:40,883 --> 01:15:45,513
They had water flooding from
his bathroom down to their place.

1096
01:15:45,855 --> 01:15:51,157
His front door, fire escape,
he had everything locked up pretty good.

1097
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:55,661
It took our guys 10 minutes.
They had to knock the thing down.

1098
01:15:56,665 --> 01:15:59,600
There's pills all over the place.

1099
01:16:00,403 --> 01:16:05,466
Just the scene alone is
pretty definitive for suicide.

1100
01:16:06,175 --> 01:16:08,575
Then I spoke to some of your partners...

1101
01:16:08,744 --> 01:16:12,339
...who ran down these problems
he'd been having lately, so...

1102
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:17,846
- Is there a note?
- No. They looked.

1103
01:16:18,421 --> 01:16:22,983
It could be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.

1104
01:16:24,059 --> 01:16:25,356
Can I get in there?

1105
01:16:25,528 --> 01:16:28,554
His place? Not now. It's sealed.

1106
01:16:29,265 --> 01:16:33,429
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen.
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.

1107
01:16:33,602 --> 01:16:36,730
I guess she's off in Europe.
But she's gotta come in.

1108
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:40,433
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back
with a toxicology report.

1109
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:44,306
That's a couple of weeks at least
that it's gotta stay like that.

1110
01:16:44,747 --> 01:16:46,112
Sorry.

1111
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,617
Sure.

1112
01:16:55,891 --> 01:16:56,880
Okay.

1113
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:05,726
I know your brother a little.
My wife works the 190 out in Queens.

1114
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:08,529
I'll tell him hello.

1115
01:17:08,704 --> 01:17:10,729
If something comes in,
I'll get back to you.

1116
01:17:11,607 --> 01:17:12,972
Yeah. I appreciate it.

1117
01:17:13,142 --> 01:17:14,939
I'm sorry for your loss.

1118
01:17:33,429 --> 01:17:36,023
- Michael.
- Jeff.

1119
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:37,665
This is tough.

1120
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:39,425
Yeah, it is. He in here?

1121
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:53,175
Dumb son of a bitch.

1122
01:17:53,682 --> 01:17:54,808
What a thing.

1123
01:17:54,984 --> 01:17:57,214
- Hold on.
- I don't even know...

1124
01:17:57,386 --> 01:17:59,286
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. All right.

1125
01:17:59,455 --> 01:18:02,686
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.

1126
01:18:02,858 --> 01:18:06,316
That crazy goddamn bastard.

1127
01:18:06,862 --> 01:18:09,854
What a waste.
What the hell was he thinking?

1128
01:18:10,533 --> 01:18:12,364
Marty? I gotta set this up.

1129
01:18:12,535 --> 01:18:14,059
Go. Go.

1130
01:18:14,803 --> 01:18:16,134
You okay?

1131
01:18:16,872 --> 01:18:18,635
Yeah, I'm fine.

1132
01:18:19,909 --> 01:18:21,968
Come on, let's get you a drink.

1133
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:29,045
I just keep replaying all this back.
Like, did I push him too hard?

1134
01:18:29,218 --> 01:18:30,446
Not a chance.

1135
01:18:30,619 --> 01:18:32,416
I just couldn't get through to him.

1136
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:35,751
What, you scared him to death?
Come on. The man was a bull.

1137
01:18:36,225 --> 01:18:39,854
- Never happened.
- Why does he fold, then? Why does he...?

1138
01:18:41,897 --> 01:18:43,762
It's gotta be an accident.

1139
01:18:43,933 --> 01:18:45,491
No, no. Arthur without a note?

1140
01:18:45,668 --> 01:18:48,637
He couldn't piss without leaving a memo.
Has to be an accident.

1141
01:18:48,804 --> 01:18:51,068
I don't get that.
I don't understand that either.

1142
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,470
One minute he's gonna
take on the whole world...

1143
01:18:53,642 --> 01:18:56,668
...and then 12 hours later,
he's sucking down pills. Why?

1144
01:18:56,845 --> 01:18:58,244
Why?

1145
01:18:59,682 --> 01:19:02,879
Because people are
fucking incomprehensible. "Why?"

1146
01:19:06,755 --> 01:19:10,213
Thirty years I know Arthur.

1147
01:19:10,693 --> 01:19:12,354
Good years.

1148
01:19:13,896 --> 01:19:18,060
And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?

1149
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:23,394
I can't even say, it's so awful.

1150
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,201
You can say it.

1151
01:19:28,744 --> 01:19:30,644
We caught a lucky break.

1152
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:35,947
We did, didn't we?

1153
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:44,092
Marty? We need to get up to the office.

1154
01:19:44,259 --> 01:19:45,988
- They accepted?
- In principle.

1155
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:48,994
Don Jeffries wants us
on the phone in half an hour.

1156
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:52,065
I tried to explain about Arthur,
but they're short on sympathy.

1157
01:19:52,234 --> 01:19:54,134
Wait a minute. U/North is settling?

1158
01:19:54,303 --> 01:19:58,364
They see a window. They wanna try.
It's their show. What are we gonna do?

1159
01:20:00,109 --> 01:20:03,237
You did what you could, Michael.
We all did.

1160
01:20:04,647 --> 01:20:05,978
It's...

1161
01:20:06,148 --> 01:20:07,809
It's what we got.

1162
01:20:08,951 --> 01:20:11,784
- You need a ride?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

1163
01:20:44,586 --> 01:20:45,575
Hello.

1164
01:20:45,754 --> 01:20:48,348
Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.

1165
01:20:48,524 --> 01:20:49,616
<i>Who is this?</i>

1166
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:53,284
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in
New York. I got your number from Arthur.

1167
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:56,329
<i>- You have got some nerve.
- Excuse me?</i>

1168
01:20:56,498 --> 01:21:00,298
You get her all the way to New York City
and then leave her at the airport?

1169
01:21:00,703 --> 01:21:02,295
<i>This is not a complicated person.</i>

1170
01:21:02,471 --> 01:21:05,304
<i>This is a girl who's never been
farther than Milwaukee.</i>

1171
01:21:05,474 --> 01:21:07,465
<i>- Wait a minute. Now, wait.
- No, you wait.</i>

1172
01:21:07,643 --> 01:21:11,875
She's coming home tomorrow
and when she does, if you call here again...

1173
01:21:12,047 --> 01:21:14,345
Are you telling me she's
in New York right now?

1174
01:21:14,817 --> 01:21:16,808
<i>This is a young girl, do you hear me?</i>

1175
01:21:16,985 --> 01:21:19,419
She's in the city right now?

1176
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:21,146
<i>What kind of people are you?</i>

1177
01:21:21,323 --> 01:21:24,349
Listen. You just stay on the phone
one second. One second.

1178
01:21:57,059 --> 01:21:58,287
<i>Anna.</i>

1179
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:02,186
Anna?

1180
01:22:02,998 --> 01:22:05,967
My name's Michael Clayton.
I'm a friend of Arthur's.

1181
01:22:06,135 --> 01:22:08,797
I spoke with your sister.
She told me you were here.

1182
01:22:10,105 --> 01:22:11,970
Please open the door, Anna.

1183
01:22:23,285 --> 01:22:24,980
What are you thinking?

1184
01:22:25,788 --> 01:22:31,090
I don't know. I'll watch the door.
You check his car. Let's get some details.

1185
01:22:33,929 --> 01:22:37,194
He didn't want to say
exactly what it was.

1186
01:22:39,067 --> 01:22:42,901
Just that when I got here,
he would pick me up...

1187
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:45,437
...and show me, and I would see...

1188
01:22:46,408 --> 01:22:49,275
...that it was something
that would win the whole case.

1189
01:22:52,481 --> 01:22:54,346
Even this morning...

1190
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:56,108
...I mean, I thought:

1191
01:22:57,653 --> 01:23:02,317
"Okay, if I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.

1192
01:23:02,491 --> 01:23:07,588
Okay, you're stupid,
and you can go home now."

1193
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:15,034
But it was there and he paid,
like, 800 dollars...

1194
01:23:15,204 --> 01:23:17,866
...for a first-class ticket.

1195
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,507
And I just...

1196
01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:25,379
I got on the plane.

1197
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:30,084
I believed him.

1198
01:23:34,857 --> 01:23:39,521
You think maybe he was
in some way disappointed?

1199
01:23:40,362 --> 01:23:44,355
Let's say that he knew that you
told somebody else about all of this...

1200
01:23:44,533 --> 01:23:47,969
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,
he was disappointed by that?

1201
01:23:49,071 --> 01:23:51,972
- But I didn't.
- You must have told somebody else.

1202
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,698
No.

1203
01:23:54,877 --> 01:23:57,038
He made me promise.

1204
01:23:58,547 --> 01:24:02,916
You didn't tell anybody else about this?
Not one other person?

1205
01:24:04,052 --> 01:24:05,451
No.

1206
01:24:10,225 --> 01:24:13,160
He really was crazy, wasn't he?

1207
01:24:25,908 --> 01:24:28,775
- You talking about this?
- Let me see.

1208
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:31,940
- You know what that is?
- Yeah.

1209
01:24:32,881 --> 01:24:35,941
You said a favor.
That's more than a favor.

1210
01:24:36,118 --> 01:24:38,279
Well, nobody's gonna know
where it came from.

1211
01:24:39,655 --> 01:24:42,089
- Are you that jammed up?
- What are you talking about?

1212
01:24:42,257 --> 01:24:44,885
Who asked for this?
It's the restaurant, right?

1213
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,551
One of these guys you owe?
"Get me a seal."

1214
01:24:47,729 --> 01:24:49,356
You really wanna know?

1215
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:08,905
This just gets better and better.

1216
01:26:10,545 --> 01:26:12,137
What are we doing?

1217
01:28:13,802 --> 01:28:14,826
Freeze!

1218
01:28:15,003 --> 01:28:17,733
Right there, asshole! Don't move!

1219
01:28:17,906 --> 01:28:20,170
- It's all right, I'm a friend!
- Get your hands up!

1220
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:22,867
Get your hands up now! Now!

1221
01:28:23,044 --> 01:28:24,978
- What's in your hand?
- It's a book.

1222
01:28:25,147 --> 01:28:28,014
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!

1223
01:28:28,183 --> 01:28:31,482
- Turn around. Slowly.
- All right. All right. Okay.

1224
01:28:31,653 --> 01:28:33,484
- Who else is here?
- Nobody.

1225
01:28:33,655 --> 01:28:36,089
- I said, who else is here?
- Nobody's here!

1226
01:28:36,258 --> 01:28:37,657
Check in there.

1227
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:41,759
You move, I'll take your head off.

1228
01:29:11,626 --> 01:29:16,063
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife...
Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.

1229
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:18,324
- Now I owe them both my balls.
- I'm sorry.

1230
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,491
- You know I am.
- "Nobody will know it's me."

1231
01:29:20,669 --> 01:29:23,729
You know what happens they don't
bury this, that I gave you this?

1232
01:29:23,905 --> 01:29:25,270
It's bad. I know it.

1233
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,500
I'm 18 months away from my 20.
You just put my pension in jeopardy.

1234
01:29:28,677 --> 01:29:30,645
- You made your point.
- It's not a point!

1235
01:29:30,812 --> 01:29:33,178
- Who called 911?
- What?

1236
01:29:33,481 --> 01:29:36,416
The building was empty. I was quiet.
I wasn't there very long.

1237
01:29:36,585 --> 01:29:39,019
Who called it in?
Does that make sense to you...?

1238
01:29:39,187 --> 01:29:40,745
This never happened.

1239
01:29:42,057 --> 01:29:44,082
You got these cops thinking
you're a lawyer.

1240
01:29:44,259 --> 01:29:46,318
You got these lawyers thinking
you're a cop.

1241
01:29:46,494 --> 01:29:50,624
You got everybody fooled, don't you?
Everybody but you.

1242
01:29:50,799 --> 01:29:52,892
You know exactly what you are.

1243
01:30:06,514 --> 01:30:08,038
We tried calling you six times.

1244
01:30:08,216 --> 01:30:10,343
But your machine must be
busted or something.

1245
01:30:12,187 --> 01:30:13,677
We gave it our best shot.

1246
01:30:15,023 --> 01:30:17,514
We ran out of red covers.
We only had 2000 in stock...

1247
01:30:17,692 --> 01:30:19,557
...so we did the other thousand in blue.

1248
01:30:40,982 --> 01:30:42,472
Is everything all right?

1249
01:30:42,651 --> 01:30:43,879
It's fine, yeah.

1250
01:30:44,586 --> 01:30:47,646
You have a van or something?
Because I have 25 boxes back there...

1251
01:30:47,822 --> 01:30:50,882
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.

1252
01:30:51,059 --> 01:30:53,289
I'll come back and pick everything up
next week.

1253
01:30:53,461 --> 01:30:55,520
- Seriously? Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

1254
01:31:16,084 --> 01:31:17,449
Hello.

1255
01:31:22,524 --> 01:31:25,823
Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

1256
01:31:26,394 --> 01:31:27,691
What?

1257
01:31:35,103 --> 01:31:37,264
<i>Do you know Michael Clayton?</i>

1258
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:38,929
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

1259
01:31:39,107 --> 01:31:40,870
We have a situation.

1260
01:32:00,662 --> 01:32:02,220
Hey, did they find you?

1261
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:05,423
- Who?
- Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.

1262
01:32:13,608 --> 01:32:14,939
Marty.

1263
01:32:15,276 --> 01:32:18,473
Your phone's off. There's too much
going on for your phone to be off.

1264
01:32:18,646 --> 01:32:20,637
- I need a minute.
- Yeah, well, we're late...

1265
01:32:20,815 --> 01:32:22,442
We never got to finish last night.

1266
01:32:22,617 --> 01:32:24,744
Did you close the place?
You look like hell.

1267
01:32:24,919 --> 01:32:27,979
- No, I left right after you left.
- If you say so.

1268
01:32:28,156 --> 01:32:30,852
We've been here all night.
We had to make an announcement.

1269
01:32:31,025 --> 01:32:34,290
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.

1270
01:32:34,462 --> 01:32:37,659
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.
I had to pull the trigger.

1271
01:32:37,832 --> 01:32:40,767
I put Bob Nast and Kim,
probably a mistake.

1272
01:32:40,935 --> 01:32:44,268
They're gonna pull together a memorial
service by the end of the week.

1273
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:46,703
I told them to call you
if they need any help.

1274
01:32:47,208 --> 01:32:49,972
No, no, no.
The other one. The other one.

1275
01:32:50,545 --> 01:32:52,843
So we cut you a check this morning.

1276
01:32:53,014 --> 01:32:56,313
There's some strings attached.
And Barry...

1277
01:32:56,484 --> 01:33:00,614
There's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be involved.

1278
01:33:04,392 --> 01:33:06,826
What if Arthur was on to something?

1279
01:33:06,995 --> 01:33:08,656
What do you mean? On to what?

1280
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:11,697
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?

1281
01:33:11,866 --> 01:33:14,027
Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

1282
01:33:14,202 --> 01:33:16,636
Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, all of it.

1283
01:33:16,805 --> 01:33:19,740
This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

1284
01:33:19,908 --> 01:33:21,899
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?

1285
01:33:22,076 --> 01:33:24,806
What would they do?
What would they do if he went public?

1286
01:33:24,979 --> 01:33:28,380
What would they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

1287
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:30,984
We don't straighten the settlement out
in 24 hours...

1288
01:33:31,152 --> 01:33:33,211
...they're gonna withhold
$9 million in fees.

1289
01:33:33,388 --> 01:33:36,357
Then they'll pull out the video of
Arthur doing his flashdance.

1290
01:33:36,524 --> 01:33:38,253
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.

1291
01:33:38,426 --> 01:33:42,089
Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger will be dead...

1292
01:33:42,263 --> 01:33:44,925
...and we'll be selling off
the goddamn furniture.

1293
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,095
That's 80.

1294
01:33:47,602 --> 01:33:49,399
We're calling it a bonus.

1295
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:52,263
Three-year contract
at your current numbers.

1296
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,067
That's assuming this all works out.

1297
01:33:54,242 --> 01:33:55,402
You're doing this now?

1298
01:33:57,078 --> 01:34:00,411
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's rules now.

1299
01:34:00,582 --> 01:34:03,449
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiality agreement.

1300
01:34:03,618 --> 01:34:05,711
It's gonna be bulletproof
and retroactive.

1301
01:34:05,887 --> 01:34:07,616
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1302
01:34:07,789 --> 01:34:11,589
...but with all you know about this place,
the clients and people who work here...

1303
01:34:11,759 --> 01:34:14,319
...it makes it a little weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

1304
01:34:14,996 --> 01:34:17,692
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come to you...

1305
01:34:17,866 --> 01:34:20,528
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

1306
01:34:20,702 --> 01:34:23,296
- If I'm wrong, I apologize.
- You're way the fuck wrong.

1307
01:34:23,471 --> 01:34:24,699
So there you go.

1308
01:34:24,873 --> 01:34:26,534
Enough. Okay? Everybody.

1309
01:34:27,408 --> 01:34:29,569
He's an asshole, but he knows it.

1310
01:34:29,978 --> 01:34:33,243
And you're on the record.
Okay? Everybody happy?

1311
01:34:33,882 --> 01:34:36,578
- Don Jeffries is here.
- We're on the way.

1312
01:34:37,385 --> 01:34:41,481
Call Bob Nast.
Just see if they need help with this thing.

1313
01:34:45,059 --> 01:34:46,424
You're welcome.

1314
01:35:39,314 --> 01:35:41,680
You said 12. This is 75.

1315
01:35:41,849 --> 01:35:44,010
Well, don't get too excited.
You want a drink?

1316
01:35:44,185 --> 01:35:46,050
No. I'm working.

1317
01:35:48,489 --> 01:35:52,016
So we're square, then. No bad blood.

1318
01:35:52,193 --> 01:35:53,888
You're just doing your job.

1319
01:35:54,062 --> 01:35:55,529
That's right.

1320
01:35:56,464 --> 01:35:58,193
Take it easy, Gabe.

1321
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,565
Michael.

1322
01:36:12,313 --> 01:36:13,746
<i>Check.</i>

1323
01:36:15,583 --> 01:36:16,845
<i>Check.</i>

1324
01:36:17,185 --> 01:36:19,915
- Check.
- Half the pot. Two hundred.

1325
01:36:20,088 --> 01:36:21,385
Two hundred to go.

1326
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:00,523
So, what happened with the bar?

1327
01:37:00,695 --> 01:37:02,720
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

1328
01:37:25,219 --> 01:37:27,983
What are you doing? You just got here.

1329
01:37:28,156 --> 01:37:30,090
Guy plays nine hands, walks away.

1330
01:37:30,258 --> 01:37:34,422
I scare you away? What did I do?
Did I scare you away?

1331
01:38:10,198 --> 01:38:11,256
Get out.

1332
01:38:12,633 --> 01:38:14,760
<i>Get out of the car now.</i>

1333
01:38:16,504 --> 01:38:17,493
<i>- Walter?
- Michael.</i>

1334
01:38:17,672 --> 01:38:19,867
<i>- Michael. Thank God you're there.
- Yeah.</i>

1335
01:38:24,278 --> 01:38:26,212
You have eight...

1336
01:38:27,115 --> 01:38:29,845
<i>... six, five...</i>

1337
01:38:30,017 --> 01:38:32,349
<i>... four, three...</i>

1338
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,147
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

1339
01:38:37,592 --> 01:38:40,618
<i>- Tell him to stay off the phone.
- All right. But you're on it?</i>

1340
01:38:41,229 --> 01:38:42,662
Am I clean?

1341
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:44,058
Just keep walking.

1342
01:38:44,232 --> 01:38:46,462
You copy. Am I clean?

1343
01:38:46,667 --> 01:38:49,659
Just keep moving.
He's walking to the car.

1344
01:38:50,204 --> 01:38:53,765
<i>- to let him know you're on the way.
I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

1345
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:56,375
<i>- Just give me two minutes.
- I'll be in the car.</i>

1346
01:39:00,081 --> 01:39:03,517
<i>I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.</i>

1347
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:35,240
It's loose. I got a pulse.
He's up there somewhere, but...

1348
01:39:37,018 --> 01:39:38,952
Let's find a way to boost the signal.

1349
01:39:46,527 --> 01:39:49,724
- I don't know what Walter promised you...
- A miracle worker!

1350
01:39:49,897 --> 01:39:53,128
That's Walter on the phone,
20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?

1351
01:39:53,301 --> 01:39:55,132
"I'm sending you a miracle worker."

1352
01:39:55,303 --> 01:39:56,964
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?

1353
01:39:57,138 --> 01:40:00,665
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're any good at it?

1354
01:40:06,447 --> 01:40:08,381
We're up. Just got a signal.

1355
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:34,606
There's nothing back this way.
What's he doing?

1356
01:40:34,775 --> 01:40:35,969
Maybe he's lost.

1357
01:40:36,143 --> 01:40:37,940
- Wait a minute.
- That's him.

1358
01:40:41,282 --> 01:40:42,510
He was alone, right?

1359
01:40:42,683 --> 01:40:45,481
- Yeah, I think so.
- Call it, yes or no?

1360
01:40:47,922 --> 01:40:49,549
We gotta turn around.

1361
01:41:19,787 --> 01:41:21,414
Talk to me.

1362
01:41:21,589 --> 01:41:23,147
It's strobing.

1363
01:41:23,324 --> 01:41:25,724
No, we're good. I think we're good.
Just keep going.

1364
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:43,134
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.

1365
01:41:43,311 --> 01:41:44,676
- Where?
- He took...

1366
01:41:45,179 --> 01:41:47,147
- He took a left.
- I don't have a left.

1367
01:41:57,124 --> 01:42:00,059
- East. He's southeast.
- What, so we missed it?

1368
01:42:00,227 --> 01:42:02,354
- Or the grid is wrong.
- Hang on.

1369
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:15,236
- We gotta go back to one.
- One is what? Where's our one?

1370
01:42:15,443 --> 01:42:18,435
Half a mile straight ahead.
Just keep driving. Just go.

1371
01:42:25,319 --> 01:42:27,947
It says we're closing.
But that's west. It can't be west.

1372
01:42:28,122 --> 01:42:29,180
The signal or the grid?

1373
01:42:29,357 --> 01:42:32,087
- It's both. It just keeps dropping out.
- Goddamn it.

1374
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:24,777
Give me the cell.

1375
01:43:27,314 --> 01:43:29,009
Our signal's good.

1376
01:45:06,914 --> 01:45:08,176
What?

1377
01:45:10,818 --> 01:45:12,513
Thanks, Mickey.

1378
01:45:12,686 --> 01:45:14,347
Just get me out of here.

1379
01:45:22,062 --> 01:45:25,793
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this,
soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.

1380
01:45:25,966 --> 01:45:29,595
I think we should have someone from
the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell...

1381
01:45:29,770 --> 01:45:31,260
- Yeah?
- Did you hear?

1382
01:45:31,438 --> 01:45:33,963
- Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North.
- No. Michael Clayton.

1383
01:45:34,408 --> 01:45:35,466
What?

1384
01:45:35,643 --> 01:45:38,544
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.
He was killed.

1385
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:40,604
What?

1386
01:45:42,283 --> 01:45:44,114
Holy shit.

1387
01:45:58,299 --> 01:46:03,236
<i>It has been and it remains
the U/North position...</i>

1388
01:46:03,404 --> 01:46:07,500
<i>... that this lawsuit is baseless
and without merit.</i>

1389
01:46:07,675 --> 01:46:11,736
Our reluctance to negotiate
was anchored by this belief...

1390
01:46:11,912 --> 01:46:17,077
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand
for settlement...

1391
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:19,811
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.

1392
01:46:19,987 --> 01:46:23,445
The reason that we are
all here today is...

1393
01:46:23,624 --> 01:46:27,492
...that several key elements
in the case have changed.

1394
01:46:28,495 --> 01:46:32,932
<i>You all have
a tentative proposal packet...</i>

1395
01:46:33,534 --> 01:46:37,493
<i>... which outlines the details,
but the bottom line is this:</i>

1396
01:46:37,671 --> 01:46:40,435
<i>Over the past several months
we had gotten word...</i>

1397
01:46:40,608 --> 01:46:43,941
...that the plaintiffs were
growing impatient...

1398
01:46:44,111 --> 01:46:47,945
...and were in the process
of revising their settlement numbers.

1399
01:46:48,449 --> 01:46:49,916
<i>We also learned...</i>

1400
01:46:50,084 --> 01:46:54,020
<i>... that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees
were capped at 32 percent...</i>

1401
01:46:54,188 --> 01:46:56,281
<i>... up to 400 million dollars...</i>

1402
01:46:56,724 --> 01:47:00,956
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1403
01:47:01,128 --> 01:47:05,690
So we knew that there would be
this motivational dead zone for them...

1404
01:47:05,866 --> 01:47:07,197
...in the middle there.

1405
01:47:07,968 --> 01:47:09,663
<i>Finally...</i>

1406
01:47:09,837 --> 01:47:14,171
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

1407
01:47:14,341 --> 01:47:16,172
...and that the tax benefit...

1408
01:47:16,343 --> 01:47:19,574
...provided that we bring
the settlement in under 600 million...

1409
01:47:19,747 --> 01:47:22,181
...and within this fiscal year...

1410
01:47:22,349 --> 01:47:28,219
...that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.

1411
01:47:28,722 --> 01:47:32,920
<i>The package that you have before you
represents, in my judgment...</i>

1412
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:38,161
<i>... the strongest possible position for
our company under the circumstances.</i>

1413
01:47:38,332 --> 01:47:40,027
<i>And, as chief counsel...</i>

1414
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:43,465
...it is my recommendation
that this proposal be confirmed.

1415
01:47:44,538 --> 01:47:48,065
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to talk about it.

1416
01:47:48,242 --> 01:47:50,506
Certainly. I'll be right outside.

1417
01:47:52,913 --> 01:47:53,902
Well...

1418
01:48:17,037 --> 01:48:18,868
How'd it go in there?

1419
01:48:21,909 --> 01:48:24,104
Pretty freaky, huh?

1420
01:48:24,278 --> 01:48:27,247
Did you see Arthur?
He's wandering around here somewhere.

1421
01:48:29,783 --> 01:48:33,048
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

1422
01:48:34,621 --> 01:48:38,318
You got one of these? It's a great memo.
It's an oldie but a goodie.

1423
01:48:41,495 --> 01:48:42,962
Got your heart racing, don't I?

1424
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:45,257
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing.

1425
01:48:45,432 --> 01:48:46,797
What do you think I'm doing?

1426
01:48:46,967 --> 01:48:48,764
The suit's over. We have a deal.

1427
01:48:48,936 --> 01:48:51,632
Whatever that is,
it's meaningless at this point.

1428
01:48:51,805 --> 01:48:55,468
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposal.

1429
01:48:55,642 --> 01:48:57,837
I didn't realize you'd signed
all those checks.

1430
01:48:58,011 --> 01:49:01,310
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?

1431
01:49:01,482 --> 01:49:02,813
I'm calling Marty.

1432
01:49:02,983 --> 01:49:05,349
Good. Good. Do it.
That's a great place to start.

1433
01:49:05,519 --> 01:49:08,317
Let's find out who told him
Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.

1434
01:49:08,489 --> 01:49:10,320
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

1435
01:49:10,491 --> 01:49:14,291
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highly doubt...

1436
01:49:14,461 --> 01:49:17,897
- I know what you did to Arthur.
- It's protected. It belongs to U/North.

1437
01:49:18,065 --> 01:49:20,829
- I know you killed him.
- It's attorney-client privilege.

1438
01:49:21,001 --> 01:49:24,664
See, now, that's just not
the way to go here, Karen.

1439
01:49:24,838 --> 01:49:27,534
For such a smart person,
you really are lost, aren't you?

1440
01:49:27,708 --> 01:49:29,039
This conversation is over.

1441
01:49:29,209 --> 01:49:32,645
I'm not the guy that you kill.
I'm the guy that you buy.

1442
01:49:32,813 --> 01:49:35,338
Are you so fucking blind
you don't even see what I am?

1443
01:49:35,516 --> 01:49:39,008
I'm the easiest part of your whole
goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?

1444
01:49:39,319 --> 01:49:42,447
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

1445
01:49:42,623 --> 01:49:46,024
I do everything from shoplifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

1446
01:49:46,193 --> 01:49:48,093
...and you're gonna kill me?

1447
01:49:49,029 --> 01:49:51,862
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

1448
01:49:52,032 --> 01:49:55,729
You want a carry permit? You want
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

1449
01:49:55,903 --> 01:49:59,737
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand
and a contract and you're gonna kill me?

1450
01:50:01,241 --> 01:50:02,674
What do you want?

1451
01:50:02,843 --> 01:50:04,367
What do I want?

1452
01:50:04,545 --> 01:50:06,137
I want more.

1453
01:50:06,647 --> 01:50:08,410
I want out.

1454
01:50:08,582 --> 01:50:11,210
And with this, I want everything.

1455
01:50:12,986 --> 01:50:14,214
Is there a number?

1456
01:50:14,388 --> 01:50:15,980
Ten is a number.

1457
01:50:16,156 --> 01:50:18,181
Ten? Ten what?

1458
01:50:20,227 --> 01:50:21,717
Ten million?

1459
01:50:21,895 --> 01:50:25,331
Where do you think I'm gonna get
10 million dollars?

1460
01:50:25,899 --> 01:50:27,799
You know what's great about this?

1461
01:50:27,968 --> 01:50:30,266
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

1462
01:50:30,838 --> 01:50:32,738
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

1463
01:50:32,906 --> 01:50:35,898
...if he wants to pass the hat
for a worthy cause.

1464
01:50:37,744 --> 01:50:40,144
This would have to be
a longer conversation...

1465
01:50:40,314 --> 01:50:42,441
...and would have to take place
somewhere else.

1466
01:50:42,616 --> 01:50:44,106
Where? My car?

1467
01:50:45,686 --> 01:50:46,710
All right.

1468
01:50:47,888 --> 01:50:50,914
I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.

1469
01:50:51,091 --> 01:50:52,888
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.

1470
01:50:55,262 --> 01:51:00,029
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something
that we could talk about.

1471
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:03,931
Good. And then the other 5 is
to forget about the 468 people...

1472
01:51:04,104 --> 01:51:06,197
...that you knocked off
with your weed killer.

1473
01:51:06,373 --> 01:51:08,739
Let me finish up this meeting.
I'll talk to Don...

1474
01:51:08,909 --> 01:51:11,503
Do I look like I'm negotiating?!

1475
01:51:11,678 --> 01:51:13,009
Karen?

1476
01:51:13,714 --> 01:51:15,579
- One second.
- Everything okay?

1477
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:17,939
Yes.

1478
01:51:18,952 --> 01:51:22,752
Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing.
Offshore. Immediately.

1479
01:51:22,923 --> 01:51:24,049
- Yes.
- Say it!

1480
01:51:24,224 --> 01:51:28,092
Ten million dollars, your account,
the moment this meeting is through.

1481
01:51:28,262 --> 01:51:30,560
- Karen! Everyone's waiting.
- I'm coming, Don.

1482
01:51:31,598 --> 01:51:32,963
You have a deal.

1483
01:51:33,534 --> 01:51:34,796
You're so fucked.

1484
01:51:35,135 --> 01:51:36,466
What?

1485
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:38,835
- You're fucked.
- What do you mean?

1486
01:51:39,006 --> 01:51:41,236
- Take a wild guess.
- Is there a problem?

1487
01:51:41,408 --> 01:51:44,104
- I don't understand.
- Let me get a picture while I'm at it.

1488
01:51:44,278 --> 01:51:47,076
- You don't want the money?
- Keep the money. You'll need it.

1489
01:51:47,247 --> 01:51:48,839
Is this fellow bothering you?

1490
01:51:49,016 --> 01:51:50,244
Am I bothering you?

1491
01:51:50,417 --> 01:51:54,444
Karen, I've got a board waiting in there.
What the hell's going on? Who are you?

1492
01:51:54,621 --> 01:51:56,316
I'm Shiva, the god of death.

1493
01:51:56,490 --> 01:52:00,119
Ron! Ronny, I need security
out here immediately.

1494
01:52:01,028 --> 01:52:02,290
All right. Here we go.

1495
01:52:02,462 --> 01:52:05,659
That guy right there, stop him.
Grab that guy.

1496
01:52:07,267 --> 01:52:09,997
- What are you doing?
- We're detectives with the N.Y.P.D.

1497
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:12,502
Come back with us
and we'll explain everything.

1498
01:52:12,673 --> 01:52:15,938
Check on her. Make sure she doesn't need
any medical attention.

1499
01:52:16,109 --> 01:52:18,270
You guys go into the ballroom.
Nobody leaves.

1500
01:52:18,445 --> 01:52:20,208
Have your guys cover every exit.

1501
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:23,178
Will you please explain to me
what's going on here?

1502
01:52:23,817 --> 01:52:25,182
Did you get all that?

1503
01:52:25,352 --> 01:52:27,547
Yeah. Got it.

1504
01:52:31,191 --> 01:52:34,024
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just gotta get some air.

1505
01:52:34,194 --> 01:52:35,684
Sure.

1506
01:52:36,063 --> 01:52:38,827
Just stay close, okay?

1507
01:52:38,999 --> 01:52:40,227
Okay.

1508
01:53:50,871 --> 01:53:52,702
So, what are we doing?

1509
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:01,771
Give me 50 dollars' worth.

1510
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:05,311
Just drive.

1511
01:59:50,563 --> 01:59:52,554
