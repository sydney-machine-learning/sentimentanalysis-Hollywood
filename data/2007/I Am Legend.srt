1
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:06,877
<i>--spring training camp and
he's definitely got the inside track.</i>

2
00:00:07,053 --> 00:00:09,647
<i>Word is that they're having
some problems with injuries.</i>

3
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:11,380
<i>Really? Are they looking into...</i>

4
00:00:11,557 --> 00:00:13,889
<i>... free-agent signings last second,
anything like that?</i>

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,392
<i>Possibly, and they've got
a strong farm club too.</i>

6
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:19,429
<i>They've got some triple-A ballplayers
they might bring up.</i>

7
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:22,226
<i>Peter would certainly be able
to tell us more about that.</i>

8
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:23,766
<i>Who do you like?</i>

9
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:26,234
<i>So far,
I like what I'm seeing in New York.</i>

10
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:29,499
<i>They've got a strong ball club, as usual.
That's in the American.</i>

11
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:32,269
<i>And in the National,
I'm still liking Chicago...</i>

12
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,879
<i>... with a little bit of a twist here
for Los Angeles.</i>

13
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:37,914
<i>Okay, so we're looking at
New York-Chicago World Series...</i>

14
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:40,678
<i>- ... possible Los Angeles.
Could be a dark horse.</i>

15
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:42,753
<i>Hold him to it
at the end of the season.</i>

16
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:45,049
<i>That's gonna do it for us
from the Sports Desk.</i>

17
00:00:45,224 --> 00:00:48,091
<i>- Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave.
Thanks for nothing, Eddie.</i>

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,890
<i>Thank you, guys. That's not all we're
following. Here's Karen at the Health Desk.</i>

19
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,501
The world of medicine
has seen its share of miracle cures...

20
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:59,297
...from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants...

21
00:00:59,472 --> 00:01:04,569
...but all past achievements may pale in
comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.

22
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:06,575
Thank you for joining us this morning.

23
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:11,581
- Not at all.
- So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

24
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:14,447
Well, the premise is quite simple.

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,987
Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

26
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:21,456
...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

27
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:23,254
- We're talking about a virus?
- Yes.

28
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:25,226
In this case, the measles virus...

29
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:30,563
...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

30
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:34,035
Um, I'm not... I find the best way
to describe it is...

31
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:36,697
...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

32
00:01:36,876 --> 00:01:41,745
...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

33
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:44,940
...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

34
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:48,416
But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

35
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:51,920
...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

36
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,389
Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,189
Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials
in humans so far.

38
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:02,095
- And how many are cancer-free?
- Ten thousand and nine.

39
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:05,396
So you have actually cured cancer?

40
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:09,234
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

41
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:03,021
What you see? What you see?

42
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:49,265
Damn.

43
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:38,430
Let's go, Sam.

44
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:41,862
Come on.

45
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:54,171
<i>Good morning, Matt.
It's looking great, I'll tell you.</i>

46
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:57,713
<i>Not only was this the biggest
snowstorm in New York City history...</i>

47
00:08:57,883 --> 00:09:01,250
<i>... it had to be one of the prettiest.
Imagine waking up on Sunday...</i>

48
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,719
<i>... to 26.9 inches of snow
in New York City.</i>

49
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,188
Here you go. Just the way you like it.

50
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:09,426
Disgusting.

51
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:12,856
Excuse me, excuse me.

52
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:16,960
All right. Come on, relax.

53
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:20,399
<i>However, it did strand
planes, trains and automobiles.</i>

54
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:24,838
<i>There was a report, a Turkish Airlines
flight skidded off the runway at JFK.</i>

55
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,808
<i>No one was injured,
but for the most part, Matt...</i>

56
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,971
There you go.

57
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:35,518
<i>I'm gonna show you, attempting
the Bob Hager rule of thumb here.</i>

58
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:38,184
<i>And I'm gonna plug my ruler in.</i>

59
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:43,260
<i>In New York, in 30 Rock,
we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.</i>

60
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:44,827
<i>Back to you, Matt and Katie.</i>

61
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:49,400
<i>Gosh. All right, it looks great. It'll be
beautiful for the next day, at least.</i>

62
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:51,433
<i>- And then it turns brown.
If that.</i>

63
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,161
<i>Anyway, Ann, thanks so much.</i>

64
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:56,796
Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.

65
00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:00,069
Don't just push them around, eat them.
I'm not playing.

66
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:02,713
<i>Good morning. This morning,
all up the East Coast...</i>

67
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:06,749
Okay. You gonna eat your vegetables.
We will sit down here all night.

68
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:09,820
<i>The biggest challenge
is getting back to work.</i>

69
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:15,254
What are you whining about?
Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?

70
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:18,226
Hey. All right, here's the deal.
Look. Look.

71
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:22,163
You're gonna eat twice as many vegetables
tomorrow night. All right?

72
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:25,326
Deal? Deal?

73
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:31,699
Come on.

74
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:39,675
<i>Don't worry
About a thing</i>

75
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:45,919
<i>'Cause every little thing
Gonna be all right</i>

76
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:49,289
I know that feels good.

77
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:54,993
<i>Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds</i>

78
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,397
Ah, Sam.

79
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:03,405
<i>Singin' sweet songs
Of melody...</i>

80
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:34,396
I'm all right.

81
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,541
I'm all right, it's all right.

82
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:07,661
What's happening? I tried to reach you
on your cell. I get a recording.

83
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,596
- Cell service is down.
- Where are we going?

84
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:12,328
- Can't get used to the new regs.
Going to Aunt Sara's.

85
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:16,235
- Ma! No! Why?
- Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.

86
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:19,400
We're at 30 minutes, colonel.
- Copy.

87
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:23,311
- Thirty minutes to what?
- They're sealing off the island.

88
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:32,420
- Seal off the island? This island?
- But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's.

89
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:34,422
Did you bring all the money?
Yeah.

90
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:35,924
How much?
Six hundred.

91
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:37,356
Why did you say, "You're going"?

92
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:38,894
That's not enough.
- Robert.

93
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:40,998
You said, "You're going,"
not, "We're going."

94
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:45,068
When you get across, I need you to get
to the ATM. Get as much cash as you can.

95
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:48,001
Take Sara's car, go upstate.
I'll meet you at the farm.

96
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:50,266
Bring enough food for two weeks.

97
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:52,967
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?

98
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:54,837
Is it airborne?

99
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:57,982
But we only go to Aunt Sara's
in the summer.

100
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,947
- It may be.
- Oh, my God.

101
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:03,849
- It's Christmas. What about my presents?
- He's announcing it.

102
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:06,388
<i>Make no mistake, Americans, this virus...</i>

103
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:08,492
You left my Christmas presents
in the closet.

104
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,649
Hush now, Mar.

105
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:13,594
<i>- threatens the survival of not only our
nation, but of every other nation...</i>

106
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,029
- Mommy, look, it's a butterfly.
- Marley, enough!

107
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:20,729
<i>And so it is with great sadness,
but even greater resolve...</i>

108
00:14:20,906 --> 00:14:23,739
<i>... that tonight I have signed
an executive order...</i>

109
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:28,141
<i>... initiating a military quarantine
of New York City.</i>

110
00:14:28,313 --> 00:14:30,281
<i>God be with us.</i>

111
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:32,507
<i>This has been a special...</i>

112
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:39,221
The window is still open. We find
something in a week or two weeks...

113
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:42,883
...we can reverse the spread.

114
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:49,296
I can still fix this.

115
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:54,227
Please. You can do the same work
outside the city.

116
00:14:54,973 --> 00:15:00,206
This is ground zero. This is my site.
We talked about this.

117
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:02,036
What are you doing?

118
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:06,409
What am I doing?

119
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:09,782
I'm not gonna let this happen.

120
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:11,820
Let? This isn't up to you.
You can't control...

121
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:14,852
Ah! Daddy, it's a monster!

122
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:31,402
How'd you sleep?

123
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:08,674
Look out. Come on,
you know better than that.

124
00:16:09,214 --> 00:16:10,374
Uh-uh.

125
00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:12,106
I'll be back.

126
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:50,053
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012,
GA series, serum 391.

127
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:53,247
Animal trials. Streaming video.

128
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:17,810
GA series results appear typical.

129
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:28,290
Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...

130
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:34,797
...11, 14, 16, 18 did not kill the virus.

131
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:38,868
Compounds 2, 5, 7...

132
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:43,303
...12, 13, 15, 17...

133
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,873
...all killed the host.

134
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:53,708
Hold on a second.

135
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,391
Compound 6 appears to be showing
decreased aggression response.

136
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:06,725
Partial pigmentation return.

137
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,790
Slight pupil constriction.

138
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:14,327
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6...

139
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:16,531
...next candidate for human trials.

140
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:19,240
You hang in there, number six.

141
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:04,380
Yeah, that's what you want.

142
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:29,112
Hey!

143
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,181
Good morning, Marge.
Good morning, Fred.

144
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,910
What are you guys doing here so early?

145
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:39,686
That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred.
Don't set it down anywhere.

146
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:46,860
I'll see you guys inside.

147
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:58,405
What's happening, buddy?

148
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:16,153
Yes.

149
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:42,376
Good morning, Hank.
I'm midway through the G's.

150
00:20:44,556 --> 00:20:47,423
Hey, who's the girl in...?

151
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:53,958
Never mind.
Hey, I'll see you in the morning.

152
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:00,532
<i>What am I supposed to say?</i>

153
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:02,868
"Hello.

154
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,607
Wanna see some infected rats?"

155
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:15,615
Okay, tomorrow.
I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.

156
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:26,523
Psst.

157
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:42,671
Come here. Hey. Hey.

158
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:44,940
Good job. You did so good.

159
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:47,914
Yes. Yes.

160
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,272
Ah.

161
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:49,605
Look at that. See that? Red salmon.

162
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:53,012
Wow, actual Spam. Yeah.

163
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,175
You'll get some of that later.

164
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:19,901
Let's go.

165
00:23:25,717 --> 00:23:27,241
Wait.

166
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:09,058
<i>My name is Robert Neville.</i>

167
00:24:09,227 --> 00:24:11,889
<i>I am a survivor living in New York City.</i>

168
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:17,634
<i>I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.</i>

169
00:24:17,802 --> 00:24:21,238
<i>I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...</i>

170
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:24,465
<i>... when the sun is highest in the sky.</i>

171
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,440
<i>If you are out there...</i>

172
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:32,280
<i>If anyone is out there...</i>

173
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,714
<i>I can provide food.</i>

174
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:37,620
<i>I can provide shelter.</i>

175
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:40,590
<i>I can provide security.</i>

176
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:45,184
<i>If there's anybody out there...</i>

177
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:47,126
<i>... anybody...</i>

178
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:49,457
<i>Please.</i>

179
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:52,360
<i>You are not alone.</i>

180
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:57,739
Fore!

181
00:25:17,328 --> 00:25:19,296
Yeah.

182
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:26,795
Keep your eye on this one for me.

183
00:25:30,274 --> 00:25:31,332
Ooh.

184
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:38,942
I'm getting good.

185
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,977
Ss-ss.

186
00:26:26,397 --> 00:26:28,365
Sam! No, no, no!

187
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:29,893
No! No! Sam!

188
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:31,792
No! No!

189
00:26:33,671 --> 00:26:36,333
Sam? Sam? Sam?

190
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:39,067
Sam? Sam?

191
00:26:42,113 --> 00:26:44,445
Sam? Sam?

192
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:46,740
Hello, Sam?

193
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,453
Sam?

194
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:55,419
Sam?

195
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:58,225
Come on. Sam.

196
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,695
I gotta go, Sam.

197
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:41,997
I gotta go. I gotta go.

198
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,571
Sam?

199
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:41,116
Sam? Sam?

200
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:43,818
Sam? Sam?

201
00:30:43,988 --> 00:30:46,889
Sam. Sam.

202
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:50,686
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go.
Sam.

203
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:53,259
What are you doing?

204
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:06,607
Sam, we gotta go!

205
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:16,347
Sam, go! Go!

206
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,852
Sam, get out! Get out!

207
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:20,673
You gotta pay attention, okay?
You gotta pay attention.

208
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,478
Listen, uh...

209
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:26,579
...I want you to stay here
on this one, okay?

210
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:31,723
Because you can still get infected.

211
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:34,326
And I can't.

212
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:54,309
So, look, if I'm not back by dark...

213
00:32:57,621 --> 00:32:59,418
...just go.

214
00:34:30,614 --> 00:34:35,950
Okay. Subject is female.
Likely 18 to 20 years of age.

215
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,454
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively
at six times human dose.

216
00:34:40,624 --> 00:34:44,492
Core temperature, 106 Fahrenheit.
Pulse, 200 bpm.

217
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:45,787
Respiration elevated.

218
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:49,831
PA 02, 300 percent of normal.

219
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,640
Pupils fully dilated.

220
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:01,141
Nonreactive to light.

221
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:14,989
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.

222
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:20,859
Symptoms and tissue samples
confirm subject is infected with KV.

223
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,828
Vaccine test.

224
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:29,302
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6.

225
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:31,607
Commencing human trials.

226
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:57,532
Respiration slowing.

227
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:02,731
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...

228
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:05,432
...105...

229
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:08,100
...104 and decreasing.

230
00:36:10,514 --> 00:36:12,175
We may have something here.

231
00:36:57,861 --> 00:37:03,800
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6
ineffective on humans.

232
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:27,116
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.

233
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,282
Still no cure.

234
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:48,703
<i>Day 1001.</i>

235
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:52,007
<i>We came in close contact
with a hive today.</i>

236
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:55,913
<i>Blood tests confirm that
I remain immune to both the airborne...</i>

237
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:58,854
...and contact strains.

238
00:37:59,022 --> 00:38:03,891
Canines remain immune
to airborne strain only.

239
00:38:05,963 --> 00:38:09,228
You can't go running
into the dark, dummy.

240
00:38:11,602 --> 00:38:13,035
Vaccine trials continue.

241
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:17,264
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity
to infected hosts.

242
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:20,706
The Krippin Virus is...

243
00:38:20,877 --> 00:38:22,868
...elegant.

244
00:38:27,918 --> 00:38:31,046
Just fishing in the dark, son.

245
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:37,927
Mm. A behavioral note, um:

246
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:43,423
An infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.

247
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:48,401
Now, it's possible
decreased brain function...

248
00:38:48,572 --> 00:38:53,669
...or the growing scarcity of food
is causing them to...

249
00:38:54,845 --> 00:38:58,781
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

250
00:39:01,518 --> 00:39:05,147
Social de-evolution appears complete.

251
00:39:05,656 --> 00:39:10,593
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.

252
00:39:17,467 --> 00:39:18,957
Why are we stopping?

253
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:25,466
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

254
00:39:25,642 --> 00:39:28,907
- We got less than 10 minutes.
- Baby, give me the dog.

255
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:34,517
- Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
Daddy!

256
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:37,017
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.

257
00:39:37,487 --> 00:39:40,854
Keep the colonel and his family
between us and don't let anyone stop you.

258
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:42,423
Mommy, they have guns!

259
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,583
It's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy.

260
00:39:44,761 --> 00:39:46,854
<i>Unless you have clearance...</i>

261
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,431
<i>... you cannot pass the checkpoint.
Please return to your homes.</i>

262
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,001
Make a hole, make a hole!
Coming through!

263
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:01,634
Coming through!

264
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:36,634
<i>Unless you have clearance,
you cannot pass the checkpoint.</i>

265
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:38,872
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

266
00:40:44,654 --> 00:40:46,918
You're clear. Move ahead.

267
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:48,381
You're clear.

268
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:51,123
All right, that's it, move up.

269
00:40:51,962 --> 00:40:53,691
All right, step up.

270
00:40:54,164 --> 00:40:56,428
You're clear. Next. Let's go.

271
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:59,100
No good.

272
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:02,295
<i>Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>

273
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,398
Come on, step back.

274
00:41:05,575 --> 00:41:08,408
<i>- Military quarantine is about to begin.
- Look, look, look.</i>

275
00:41:08,578 --> 00:41:10,512
I'm not infected.
Clear. Good, go on.

276
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,806
I'm not infected.

277
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:13,414
Please! Please!

278
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:17,314
- Please take my baby. Take my baby, please.
You're gonna have to move back.

279
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:20,856
- No good.
Follow me, ma'am.

280
00:41:21,024 --> 00:41:24,357
What? No! Robert! Robert!

281
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:26,723
Get your hands off my wife.
Get your hands off.

282
00:41:26,897 --> 00:41:29,263
- Mommy!
Stand down.

283
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:30,456
Lieutenant...

284
00:41:30,634 --> 00:41:33,296
- Mommy!
- Scan her again. Get your hands off of her!

285
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,937
Get your hands off of my wife.

286
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:37,437
Stand down!
- Scan her again. Stand down!

287
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:40,201
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!

288
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:43,972
I am Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville.
I am ordering you to scan her again.

289
00:41:44,147 --> 00:41:45,842
Scan her again!

290
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:51,445
All right, scan her again.

291
00:41:54,457 --> 00:41:57,255
- It's clear.
- It's clear. Move through.

292
00:41:59,629 --> 00:42:00,789
Who's next? Come on.

293
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:03,865
Take my baby with you!
Please! Please!

294
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:07,231
- Mommy!
- Please take my baby. Please!

295
00:42:08,672 --> 00:42:12,438
Daddy, why can't the little girl come too?

296
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:15,171
<i>Stay away from the shoreline.</i>

297
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:17,006
How long?

298
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:19,448
Five minutes. We'll make it.

299
00:42:19,616 --> 00:42:22,779
This is Ranger 621, we're on site.

300
00:42:23,353 --> 00:42:26,516
<i>Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>

301
00:42:38,602 --> 00:42:43,596
I won't take my eyes off them, colonel.
You got my word on it.

302
00:42:48,511 --> 00:42:50,103
Give me a kiss.

303
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,252
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

304
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,827
Dear Lord, please watch over Robert...

305
00:43:06,997 --> 00:43:09,329
...and keep him strong
through the struggles ahead.

306
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:13,526
Lord, please just bring him home safely.
Amen.

307
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,539
Daddy's gonna make the monsters
go away, baby, okay?

308
00:43:17,707 --> 00:43:20,005
Sam, you protect Daddy.

309
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:24,135
- No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog.
Sir, we gotta go!

310
00:43:26,883 --> 00:43:30,250
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

311
00:43:30,887 --> 00:43:33,151
<i>It's a butterfly.</i>

312
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:37,718
All right, come on, let's go!

313
00:44:23,937 --> 00:44:25,461
How'd you sleep?

314
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:28,767
<i>Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look
at the ongoing mutations...</i>

315
00:44:28,942 --> 00:44:33,845
<i>... of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed
miracle cure for cancer.</i>

316
00:44:34,014 --> 00:44:38,144
<i>So far, almost 5000 patients
treated with her retrofitted virus...</i>

317
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,152
<i>... have begun exhibiting symptoms
resembling the early onset of rabies.</i>

318
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:45,120
<i>Twenty-five patients have already died.</i>

319
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:49,490
<i>Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals
to stockpile antiviral drugs...</i>

320
00:44:49,663 --> 00:44:52,598
<i>... and to begin
preliminary quarantine protocols.</i>

321
00:44:52,766 --> 00:44:54,324
It's my birthday.

322
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:57,868
<i>We are fully confident Dr. Neville
can see us through these...</i>

323
00:44:58,038 --> 00:44:59,733
You gonna sing?

324
00:45:00,674 --> 00:45:03,108
<i>My name is Robert Neville.</i>

325
00:45:03,643 --> 00:45:06,840
<i>I am a survivor living in New York City.</i>

<i>I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.</i>

00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,849
<i>I will be at the South Street Seaport

328
00:45:17,023 --> 00:45:19,856
<i>... when the sun is highest in the sky.</i>

329
00:45:21,027 --> 00:45:26,090
<i>If you are out there,
if anyone is out there...</i>

330
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:30,464
<i>I can provide food. I can provide shelter.</i>

331
00:45:30,637 --> 00:45:33,367
<i>I can provide security.</i>

333
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:41,176
<i>Please.</i>

334
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,772
<i>You are not alone.</i>

335
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,376
Listen, uh...

336
00:45:46,553 --> 00:45:49,920
...if you're planning a party or something,
just tell me now.

337
00:45:50,223 --> 00:45:52,987
Okay? Because you know
I don't like surprises.

338
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:56,754
And I swear I'll act surprised. Okay?

339
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,523
Hey! Hey!

340
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:44,735
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

341
00:46:47,314 --> 00:46:50,442
What the...? What the hell are you...?
No!

342
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:53,317
No! No!

343
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:56,853
No.

344
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,890
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

345
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,524
How did you get out here?!

346
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:05,859
Fred, if you're real,
you better tell me right now!

347
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:09,468
If you're real,
you better tell me right now!

348
00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:24,576
Damn it, Fred!

349
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:27,109
Damn it!

350
00:49:27,607 --> 00:49:31,008
I'm all right. I'm all right, I'm all right.

351
00:49:56,836 --> 00:49:59,703
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

352
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:27,692
Baby. I'm okay.

353
00:50:28,635 --> 00:50:31,798
I'm okay. I'm okay.

354
00:51:49,415 --> 00:51:51,178
Let's go.

355
00:51:51,351 --> 00:51:54,286
Eh, eh! Come on. Sam, come on.

356
00:52:06,733 --> 00:52:07,825
Let's go! Sam!

357
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:19,874
No! No! Let's go!

358
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:22,776
We gotta go home, Sam. Let's go!

359
00:52:51,577 --> 00:52:53,010
Sam!

360
00:52:59,419 --> 00:53:01,284
No!

361
00:53:24,977 --> 00:53:27,377
Sam? Sam?

362
00:53:30,149 --> 00:53:31,514
It's okay.

363
00:53:31,684 --> 00:53:34,744
You're all right. Okay. It's okay.

364
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:37,412
You're all right. You're all right.

365
00:53:37,824 --> 00:53:40,554
Samantha? Samantha, look at me, girl.

366
00:53:40,727 --> 00:53:44,959
Hey. You're okay.
You're okay. Samantha.

367
00:53:45,131 --> 00:53:48,294
We just gotta get you home.
Gotta get you... Gotta take you home.

368
00:53:48,468 --> 00:53:51,028
Let me take you home.
All right, come here.

369
00:53:51,204 --> 00:53:53,672
Come here. Come here. Come here.

370
00:54:28,574 --> 00:54:30,132
Come on. Come here. Come here.

371
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:32,741
I got you. I got you.

372
00:54:39,752 --> 00:54:41,481
It's okay.

373
00:54:42,388 --> 00:54:44,117
You're okay.

374
00:54:52,198 --> 00:54:53,927
<i>Don't worry</i>

375
00:54:56,135 --> 00:54:58,262
<i>About a thing</i>

376
00:54:59,305 --> 00:55:04,470
<i>'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right</i>

377
00:55:07,947 --> 00:55:13,579
<i>Don't worry
About a thing</i>

378
00:55:18,391 --> 00:55:20,825
<i>Rise up this morning</i>

379
00:55:22,461 --> 00:55:25,055
<i>Smiled with the rising sun</i>

380
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,395
<i>Three little birds</i>

381
00:58:36,622 --> 00:58:39,056
I promised my friend...

382
00:58:40,693 --> 00:58:45,858
...that I would say hello to you today.

383
00:58:50,536 --> 00:58:52,265
Hello.

384
00:59:00,012 --> 00:59:01,707
Hello.

385
00:59:12,191 --> 00:59:14,989
Please say hello to me.

386
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:24,631
Please say hello to me.

387
01:00:45,117 --> 01:00:46,675
Die!

388
01:00:46,986 --> 01:00:48,078
Die!

389
01:01:02,101 --> 01:01:03,830
Die!

390
01:02:43,769 --> 01:02:47,170
Come on! Stay with me!

391
01:02:48,707 --> 01:02:51,267
Where do you live?

392
01:02:53,112 --> 01:02:54,977
Hey.

393
01:02:55,447 --> 01:02:56,971
Hey!

394
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:59,276
Stay with me.

395
01:03:00,185 --> 01:03:02,449
Where do you live?

396
01:03:05,424 --> 01:03:07,949
Where do you live?

397
01:03:08,727 --> 01:03:09,955
Uh...

398
01:03:10,129 --> 01:03:14,327
11 Washington Square.

399
01:03:14,867 --> 01:03:17,597
They don't know where I live.

400
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:21,962
Don't... Don't let them track us.

401
01:03:22,408 --> 01:03:24,933
You gotta stay out till dawn.

402
01:04:28,807 --> 01:04:29,796
No!

403
01:04:31,377 --> 01:04:33,311
<i>Donkey?</i>

404
01:04:34,279 --> 01:04:35,371
<i>What are you doing?</i>

405
01:04:35,547 --> 01:04:38,880
<i>I would think of all people you would
recognize a wall when you see one.</i>

406
01:04:39,051 --> 01:04:43,818
<i>Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.</i>

407
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:46,958
<i>It is. Around your half, see?
That's your half, this is my half.</i>

408
01:04:47,126 --> 01:04:50,687
<i>Oh, your half? Hm.
Yes, my half.</i>

409
01:04:50,863 --> 01:04:54,492
<i>I helped rescue the princess. I did
half the work. I get half the booty.</i>

410
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:58,033
<i>Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.</i>

411
01:04:58,203 --> 01:05:00,330
<i>Back off!
No, you back off.</i>

412
01:05:00,506 --> 01:05:02,565
<i>This is my swamp!
Our swamp.</i>

413
01:05:05,411 --> 01:05:08,209
<i>- Smelly ogre.
Fine!</i>

414
01:05:08,914 --> 01:05:10,643
<i>Come back,
I'm not through with you!</i>

415
01:05:10,816 --> 01:05:12,306
<i>Well, I'm through with you.</i>

416
01:05:12,484 --> 01:05:15,578
<i>You know, with you
it's always "me, me, me."</i>

417
01:05:15,754 --> 01:05:20,817
<i>Well, guess what, now it's my turn.
So you just shut up and pay attention!</i>

418
01:05:20,993 --> 01:05:25,157
<i>You are mean to me! You insult me and
you don't appreciate anything that I do.</i>

419
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:27,730
<i>You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.</i>

420
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:32,269
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?</i>

421
01:05:32,438 --> 01:05:35,601
<i>Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!</i>

422
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:37,669
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

423
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:40,175
<i>You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...</i>

424
01:05:40,345 --> 01:05:41,812
<i>... for stabbing me in the back!</i>

425
01:05:45,184 --> 01:05:48,676
<i>You're so wrapped up in layers,
you're afraid of your own feelings.</i>

426
01:05:48,854 --> 01:05:50,014
<i>Go away.
See?</i>

427
01:05:50,189 --> 01:05:52,316
<i>Doing it again,
just like you did to Fiona...</i>

428
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:54,686
<i>... and all she did was like you,
maybe love you.</i>

429
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:59,320
<i>Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.</i>

430
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:01,125
<i>I heard the two of you talking.</i>

431
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:06,135
<i>She wasn't talking about you,
she was talking about somebody else.</i>

432
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,648
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.

433
01:06:17,816 --> 01:06:19,841
Obviously you know that.

434
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:21,913
They're yours.

435
01:06:22,087 --> 01:06:27,081
But I did find bacon, which is about
the most fantastic thing in history.

436
01:06:27,259 --> 01:06:31,059
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

437
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:33,596
I put by your plate,
because your leg is okay...

438
01:06:33,765 --> 01:06:37,963
...but it won't be for very long
if you don't start a course soon.

439
01:06:39,271 --> 01:06:41,068
Who are you?

440
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:45,101
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.

441
01:06:52,184 --> 01:06:54,311
Don't let it get cold.

442
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,996
It's okay. Go on.

443
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,256
We came from Maryland.
We heard your message on the radio.

444
01:07:39,965 --> 01:07:43,025
We were at the pier at noon.
We waited all day.

445
01:07:45,003 --> 01:07:47,471
We're going to Vermont.

446
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,802
To the survivors' colony.

447
01:07:51,376 --> 01:07:52,968
What?

448
01:07:53,912 --> 01:07:57,541
In Bethel. It's a safe zone.

449
01:07:57,716 --> 01:08:00,184
There's no survivors' colony,
there's no safe zones.

450
01:08:00,352 --> 01:08:02,377
Nothing happened
the way it was supposed to.

451
01:08:02,554 --> 01:08:04,454
Nothing worked
the way it was supposed to.

452
01:08:04,623 --> 01:08:09,219
In the mountains. There's a whole colony
of people there who didn't get sick.

453
01:08:09,394 --> 01:08:11,919
The virus couldn't survive the cold.
There's a colony...

454
01:08:12,097 --> 01:08:14,327
Shut up! Shut up!

455
01:08:14,499 --> 01:08:15,932
Everybody's dead.

456
01:08:16,168 --> 01:08:18,227
Everybody is dead.

457
01:08:26,178 --> 01:08:29,272
I just need...
I need a minute. Okay?

458
01:08:30,882 --> 01:08:32,406
Just...

459
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:39,222
I just... I was saving that bacon.

460
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:42,089
I was saving it.

461
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:47,398
I'm just... I'm gonna go upstairs.
All right? Just...

462
01:08:47,566 --> 01:08:49,591
I'm gonna go.

463
01:09:07,719 --> 01:09:10,347
Ethan, put the knife down.

464
01:09:45,357 --> 01:09:49,293
<i>You there! Ogre.
Aye.</i>

465
01:09:49,461 --> 01:09:51,622
<i>By the order of Lord Farquaad...</i>

466
01:09:51,797 --> 01:09:54,197
<i>... I am authorized
to place you both under arrest...</i>

467
01:09:54,366 --> 01:10:00,168
<i>... and transport you
to a designated resettlement facility.</i>

468
01:10:00,338 --> 01:10:04,707
<i>Oh, really? You and what army?</i>

469
01:10:15,987 --> 01:10:17,648
Can I say something to you?

470
01:10:17,823 --> 01:10:20,815
You was really, really something
back there. Incredible.

471
01:10:21,159 --> 01:10:23,184
Are you talking to...

472
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:25,353
...me?

473
01:10:26,798 --> 01:10:30,029
Yes, I was talking to you.
You was really great back there.

474
01:10:30,202 --> 01:10:33,433
Those guards, they thought they was
all that. You showed up, and bam!

475
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:35,869
Tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

476
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:38,066
That really made me
feel good to see that.

477
01:10:38,243 --> 01:10:40,438
That's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.

478
01:10:40,912 --> 01:10:44,746
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

479
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:46,406
Hm?

480
01:10:46,585 --> 01:10:48,018
But, uh...

481
01:10:48,253 --> 01:10:49,811
...I don't have any friends.

482
01:10:49,988 --> 01:10:52,456
And I'm not going out there by myself.

483
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:55,252
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.
I'll stick with you!

484
01:10:55,427 --> 01:10:57,190
<i>You a mean, green fighting machine.</i>

485
01:10:57,362 --> 01:11:00,456
<i>Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.</i>

486
01:11:03,702 --> 01:11:04,964
<i>I like Shrek.</i>

487
01:11:05,137 --> 01:11:07,571
<i>That was really scary.
If you don't mind me saying...</i>

488
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:10,469
<i>... if that don't work, your breath
will get the job done...</i>

489
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:14,578
<i>... because you definitely need some
tic tacs, because your breath stinks!</i>

490
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:19,207
<i>Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose. Just like the time...</i>

491
01:11:21,686 --> 01:11:24,314
You're not so good with people anymore,
are you?

492
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:32,286
Thank you for my leg.

493
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,563
Okay.

494
01:11:39,638 --> 01:11:41,162
Where have you been?

495
01:11:41,406 --> 01:11:44,967
I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship
out of Sao Paulo.

496
01:11:45,143 --> 01:11:48,237
Those boats
weren't meant to be permanent.

497
01:11:48,413 --> 01:11:49,971
No, they weren't.

498
01:11:50,148 --> 01:11:53,140
When the Navy fell apart,
we started docking to take on supplies.

499
01:11:53,318 --> 01:11:57,084
Someone picked it up on shore.
Five of us were immune.

500
01:11:57,255 --> 01:11:58,916
You said five?

501
01:11:59,591 --> 01:12:01,957
The Darkseekers got them.

502
01:12:04,329 --> 01:12:06,957
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

503
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:17,172
It's too late today.

504
01:12:17,342 --> 01:12:20,470
If we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can
make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

505
01:12:20,645 --> 01:12:23,113
- So if you had...
- I'm not leaving.

506
01:12:23,982 --> 01:12:26,314
This is ground zero.

507
01:12:27,752 --> 01:12:29,913
This is my site.

508
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:34,047
I'm not gonna let this happen.

509
01:12:36,228 --> 01:12:38,526
I can still fix this.

510
01:12:51,343 --> 01:12:56,007
Whoa. You scared me.
- Sorry.

511
01:12:56,181 --> 01:12:57,512
I called down twice.

512
01:12:57,682 --> 01:13:00,344
Oh. Oh, thank you.

513
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:08,618
It's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.

514
01:13:08,793 --> 01:13:11,523
I've never seen one so still.

515
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:14,826
They're always biting.

516
01:13:18,837 --> 01:13:21,169
You think that can cure her?

517
01:13:21,339 --> 01:13:24,274
Um... No, this will
almost certainly kill it...

518
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:27,673
...but it's possible by drastically reducing
the body temperature...

519
01:13:27,846 --> 01:13:30,838
...I can increase the compound's
effectiveness.

520
01:13:42,127 --> 01:13:44,425
Did all of them die?

521
01:13:44,663 --> 01:13:46,221
Yes.

522
01:13:49,301 --> 01:13:51,292
My God.

523
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:55,868
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.

524
01:14:01,212 --> 01:14:03,544
Where can Ethan sleep?

525
01:14:22,233 --> 01:14:24,098
He's heavy.

526
01:14:30,608 --> 01:14:32,405
Can you get that?

527
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:06,507
She's beautiful.

528
01:15:06,978 --> 01:15:08,878
What's her name?

529
01:15:10,582 --> 01:15:12,482
Marley.

530
01:15:13,752 --> 01:15:17,313
- Her name was Marley.
- It's a beautiful name.

531
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:23,251
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.

532
01:15:23,428 --> 01:15:26,761
- Who?
- Uh, the singer.

533
01:15:27,799 --> 01:15:29,528
Damian?

534
01:15:30,802 --> 01:15:32,827
Uh, his father.

535
01:15:36,107 --> 01:15:38,371
His father.

536
01:15:39,444 --> 01:15:40,570
Nope.

537
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,838
<i>I shot the sheriff</i>

538
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:49,120
<i>But I didn't shoot the deputy</i>

539
01:15:56,628 --> 01:16:01,656
- Oh, that is unacceptable.
- What?

540
01:16:06,304 --> 01:16:08,795
Best album ever made.

541
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:21,209
- You don't recognize that?
- Mm-mm.

542
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,748
Wow.

543
01:16:25,924 --> 01:16:31,487
He had this idea,
it was kind of a virologist's idea.

544
01:16:31,663 --> 01:16:36,293
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate. Literally cure it...

545
01:16:36,468 --> 01:16:42,600
...by injecting music and love
into people's lives.

546
01:16:43,441 --> 01:16:47,309
One day, he was scheduled
to perform at a peace rally.

547
01:16:47,479 --> 01:16:51,438
Gunmen came to his house
and shot him down.

548
01:16:53,284 --> 01:16:54,615
Two days later...

549
01:16:55,253 --> 01:16:58,882
...he walked out on that stage and sang.

550
01:17:00,692 --> 01:17:03,092
Somebody asked him why.

551
01:17:04,896 --> 01:17:07,364
He said, "The people...

552
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:12,595
...who are trying to make this world worse
are not taking a day off.

553
01:17:13,771 --> 01:17:15,762
How can I?"

554
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:21,676
Light up the darkness.

555
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:49,935
Come with us, Neville.

556
01:17:50,508 --> 01:17:52,533
To the colony.

557
01:17:56,247 --> 01:17:58,681
There's no colony, Anna.

558
01:18:02,987 --> 01:18:04,511
Everything just fell apart.

559
01:18:04,689 --> 01:18:08,386
- There was no evacuation plan...
- You're wrong. There is a colony.

560
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,985
I know, okay?

561
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:13,658
How do you know, Anna?

562
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:21,229
I just know.

563
01:18:23,508 --> 01:18:27,638
How? I said, how do you know?
How could you know?

564
01:18:29,347 --> 01:18:30,678
God told me.

565
01:18:31,182 --> 01:18:33,173
He has a plan.

566
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:37,513
- God told you?
- Yes.

567
01:18:37,689 --> 01:18:40,419
- The God?
- Yes.

568
01:18:41,993 --> 01:18:44,427
- I know how this sounds.
- It sounds crazy.

569
01:18:44,596 --> 01:18:48,396
But something told me
to turn on the radio.

570
01:18:48,566 --> 01:18:50,193
Something told me to come here.

571
01:18:50,368 --> 01:18:53,166
My voice on the radio
told you to come here, Anna.

572
01:18:53,338 --> 01:18:55,363
You were trying to kill yourself
last night?

573
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,529
Anna.

574
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:59,871
I got here just in time to save your life.
That's a coincidence?

575
01:19:00,044 --> 01:19:03,673
- Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
- He must have sent me here for a reason.

576
01:19:04,849 --> 01:19:07,875
Neville, the world is quieter now.

577
01:19:08,052 --> 01:19:10,111
You just have to listen.

578
01:19:10,288 --> 01:19:12,449
If we listen...

579
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:15,092
...we can hear God's plan.

580
01:19:15,293 --> 01:19:17,318
- God's plan?
- Yeah.

581
01:19:17,495 --> 01:19:20,055
All right. Let me tell you
about your God's plan.

582
01:19:20,231 --> 01:19:23,132
There were 6 billion people on Earth
when the infection hit.

583
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:27,897
KV had a 90 percent kill rate.
That's 5.4 billion...

584
01:19:28,072 --> 01:19:30,540
...people dead.

585
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:33,541
Crashed and bled out, dead.

586
01:19:33,711 --> 01:19:35,576
Less than 1 percent immunity.

587
01:19:35,747 --> 01:19:39,547
That left 12 million healthy people
like you, me and Ethan.

588
01:19:39,717 --> 01:19:43,847
The other 588 million...

589
01:19:44,022 --> 01:19:46,013
...turned into your Darkseekers.

590
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,885
And then they got hungry.

591
01:19:48,059 --> 01:19:52,462
And they killed and fed on everybody.

592
01:19:53,631 --> 01:19:55,724
Everybody!

593
01:19:56,434 --> 01:20:01,394
Every single person
that you or I has ever known...

594
01:20:01,572 --> 01:20:03,506
...is dead!

595
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:07,743
Dead!

596
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,810
There is no God. There is no God.

597
01:20:17,121 --> 01:20:18,952
What is that?

598
01:20:22,293 --> 01:20:25,626
Was it still dark when you
brought us home last night?

599
01:20:25,797 --> 01:20:28,891
You were bleeding.
There was light on the horizon.

600
01:20:30,468 --> 01:20:33,198
Turn the light off. Turn it off.

601
01:20:40,478 --> 01:20:41,911
They followed us home.

602
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,741
Ethan.

603
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:31,588
Shit.

604
01:21:44,308 --> 01:21:45,935
Anna.

605
01:21:47,478 --> 01:21:49,275
Anna.

606
01:21:54,051 --> 01:21:55,678
Anna!

607
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:09,232
Anna!

608
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:14,229
Anna!

609
01:24:00,678 --> 01:24:02,305
Anna?

610
01:24:06,284 --> 01:24:08,013
Anna.

611
01:25:05,876 --> 01:25:08,071
Come on. Come on.

612
01:25:09,113 --> 01:25:11,081
- Are you okay? You all right?
Yeah.

613
01:25:11,248 --> 01:25:12,772
Are you all right?

614
01:25:13,417 --> 01:25:15,544
- You okay?
- Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

615
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,794
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!

616
01:25:32,069 --> 01:25:34,867
Get to the lab! To the lab!

617
01:25:44,215 --> 01:25:45,239
Get behind the Plexi.

618
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:47,744
Oh, my God. Come on.

619
01:26:00,331 --> 01:26:02,094
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

620
01:26:03,901 --> 01:26:05,664
Oh, my God.

621
01:26:18,149 --> 01:26:20,140
It's working.

622
01:26:24,488 --> 01:26:25,853
Neville...

623
01:26:27,158 --> 01:26:28,955
...it's working.

624
01:26:34,265 --> 01:26:36,062
No! Stop! Stop!

625
01:26:37,368 --> 01:26:39,666
Look, look, look, I can save you.

626
01:26:39,837 --> 01:26:43,295
I can sa... I can help you.
You are sick and I can help you.

627
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,378
I can... I can fix this!

628
01:26:48,546 --> 01:26:50,070
I can save everybody!

629
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:53,478
I can fix everything! It's working.
It's working!

630
01:26:56,721 --> 01:26:58,154
Stop! Stop!

631
01:27:04,295 --> 01:27:07,731
Let me save you! Let me save you!

632
01:27:07,898 --> 01:27:08,887
No, no!

633
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:21,041
No, no!

634
01:27:37,962 --> 01:27:40,192
<i>Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.</i>

635
01:28:06,357 --> 01:28:07,915
Robert.

636
01:28:08,225 --> 01:28:10,955
- What are you doing?
- The cure is in her blood.

637
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:17,967
Coal chute. I think it'll be safe.
Ethan, get in!

638
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:19,734
- Go.
- Come on, get in.

639
01:28:19,904 --> 01:28:21,769
- Get in.
- Anna.

640
01:28:25,442 --> 01:28:27,876
I think this is why you're here.

641
01:28:30,948 --> 01:28:32,643
What are you doing?

642
01:28:32,817 --> 01:28:34,876
I'm listening.

643
01:28:35,486 --> 01:28:37,317
- Neville, there's room. Come!
- No.

644
01:28:37,488 --> 01:28:40,457
They're not gonna stop.
They're not gonna stop.

645
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,691
Stay in till dawn.

646
01:31:03,233 --> 01:31:07,966
<i>In 2009, a deadly virus
burned through our civilization...</i>

647
01:31:08,138 --> 01:31:11,403
<i>... pushing humankind
to the edge of extinction.</i>

648
01:31:11,575 --> 01:31:14,510
<i>Dr. Robert Neville dedicated his life...</i>

649
01:31:14,778 --> 01:31:17,042
<i>... to the discovery of a cure...</i>

650
01:31:17,214 --> 01:31:19,944
<i>... and the restoration of humanity.</i>

651
01:31:20,117 --> 01:31:23,245
<i>On September 9th, 2012...</i>

652
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:26,321
<i>... at approximately 8:49 P.M...</i>

653
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:28,424
<i>... he discovered that cure.</i>

654
01:31:29,626 --> 01:31:34,893
<i>And at 8:52, he gave his life to defend it.</i>

655
01:31:35,065 --> 01:31:38,432
<i>We are his legacy.</i>

656
01:31:38,602 --> 01:31:41,969
