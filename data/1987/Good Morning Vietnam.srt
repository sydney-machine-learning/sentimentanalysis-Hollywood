1
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,120
...to recover contents such as shoes,
socks and undergarments.

2
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,030
And now an item of special note.

3
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,629
Barring any change in the weather,
the softball game...

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,350
between the 133rd
and 4th infantry divisions...

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,329
will resume as scheduled
at the Ban Mi Thout Park...

6
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,320
corner of Viet Ho and Hguen
Van Theiuh streets here in Saigon.

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,750
Please make a note of it.
Excuse me.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,060
Those men who lost equipment
in last week's rains...

9
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,390
are asked to contact
Lieutenant Sam Scheer.

10
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,850
Lieutenant Schneer-- Lieutenant Scheer
asks those men with waterlogged mitts...

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,530
to make every effort to dry them out
in the sun before requesting new ones.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,520
Bookworms: Headquarters
Support Activities Saigon...

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,689
operates libraries at six locations
in the Republic of Vietnam.

14
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,140
American personnel can check out a book
in Ku Bai, Da Nang...

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,459
Phung Tao, Saigon,
Bien Wah and San Treng.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,909
If you can't stop in
and select your own books...

17
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,989
write to the HSAS Library.

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,890
Ask for the books by author,
title and subject...

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,359
and your selections
will be mailed to you.

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,989
With the holiday season
rapidly approaching...

21
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,780
those personnel wishing
to spend Christmas cards home--

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,519
wishing to send Christmas
cards home to the States--

23
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,640
are asked to do so
no later than August 13...

24
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,890
due to a yearly mail rush
at that time.

25
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,030
Don't disappoint your--

26
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,689
So take your liberties, but
watch the liberties you take,

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,340
lost luggage:

28
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,359
The Armed Forces sincerely
regrets any inconvenience...

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,180
due to luggage lost
on transport carriers,

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,859
Personal missing luggage-- that should
be personnel missing luggage--

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,530
are asked to drop a card to Major
Gerald Kleiner over at the 5th.

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,140
The card should be no larger
than four by five inches...

33
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,789
and should describe
the contents of your duffel.

34
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,360
Major Kleiner requests that you
do not describe your duffel
as all duffels look alike.

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,580
Those personnel with lost bag--

36
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,360
- All right.
- Hey, Sarge, where are the women?

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,729
- Airman Cronauer?
- You got it.

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,280
- Welcome to Saigon, sir.
- Careful. You could
put an eye out with that.

39
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,189
- God, it's warm, huh?
- Warm? No. This is a setting
for London broil.

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,750
I'm Private First Class Edward
Montesque Garlick at your service, sir.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,840
Well, first thing, Garlick,
is you gotta requisition a new name.

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,039
I like you already, sir.

43
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,949
Actually, what I am, sir, is
your Armed Forces Radio Saigon
assistant who's in charge...

44
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,830
of orientation and billeting of
enlisted personnel, and company clerk.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,069
Whew. I'm impressed.

46
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,719
- It's already started.
- I understand.

47
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,759
Dream on

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,490
little dreamer
Dream on

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,030
Dream about a love so fine

50
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,530
Sweet as apple-berry wine

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Dream on

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,469
little dreamer
Dream on

53
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,219
This is AFRS, Radio Saigon.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,050
AFRS Radio is owned and operated
by the United States government...

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,270
and operates on an assigned
carrier frequency of 540...

56
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,460
- at 749 megahertz,
- Jesus, that guy's
as boring as whale shit.

57
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,919
Not really.
See, the purpose is to inform you
as to the radius of the radio waves.

58
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,810
- ...by Mantovani,
- Mantovani?

59
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,199
They play Mantovani to insomniacs
who don't respond to strong drugs.

60
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,620
General likes easy listening. You know,
I'm really gonna have to inform you--

61
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,729
Mayday! Mayday! Dragon lady
with incredible figure at 11:00.
Stop the car.

62
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,590
- I can't do that, sir.
- Oh, Edward, Edward,
you don't understand.

63
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,569
I've been on a small Greek island
with a lot of women who look like Zorba.
I never thought I'll find
women attractive ever again.

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,659
And now that I do, you won't even
turn the car around? Thanks a lot.

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,790
- You have a very important
meeting with the top brass.
- Oh! There she is again!

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,529
- How'd she get ahead of us?
- That's another person, sir.

67
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,160
Ah, she's beautiful and quick.
Speed up. Check her stamina.

68
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,339
This is incredible! Oh, my God!
They're quick, they're fast and small.

69
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,689
I feel like a fox
in a chicken coop.

70
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,920
We got a  new man comin'in.

71
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,670
- Don't you understand, Dick?
- No, sir. Frankly, I do not understand.

72
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,930
Would you kindly
lower your tone, please?

73
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes, sir.

74
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,750
I run this show, General. If anything
screws up, it's my ass in the mower.

75
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,699
I deserve to be notifed
of any changes that are made.

76
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,379
Nobody's arguing that with you.

77
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,629
Look, I caught his show on the
Isle of Crete, and this guy is funny.

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,879
I damn near busted a gut laughin' at
him. And the troops, they love him.

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,480
This is a tempest in a teacup...

80
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,670
much ado about nothing.

81
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,959
For crying out loud, man,
this isn't brain surgery.

82
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,829
Don't get crazy over this, Dick.
We're only talking about a damn deejay.

83
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,600
Sir, there is no such thing as "only"
any more. Not now. Not in Saigon.

84
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,220
Lieutenant Steven Hauk
is our immediate supervisor.

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,459
He's a little goofy,
but he's okay.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,259
Sergeant Major Dickerson--
That's another story altogether.

87
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,189
He was a commander
of an elite special forces unit.

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,509
He came to us because
of "prostrate" problems...

89
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,550
and some sort of social infection
that doesn't go away.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,189
Plus, I think he got shot in the ass,
but I can't confirm that.

91
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,300
Anyway, he's the man
that you don't want to aggravate.

92
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,790
- Ed, are you always this happy?
- Cronauer!

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,750
- Sir!
- At ease. I'm General Taylor.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,889
- Hiya, General.
- A real pleasure.

95
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,860
Listen, if you have any problems
here now, you come see me.

96
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,540
I'm the tallest hog
in the trough around here.

97
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,290
- Garlick, have you put on some weight?
- I don't think so, sir.

98
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,709
Why, son, the shadow
of your ass'd weigh 20 pounds.

99
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,329
I'll work on that, sir.
You're not supposed to address
the general saying "hiya."

100
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,689
- What's that, a new rule?
- No, old rule.

101
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,990
- That's Lieutenant Hauk in there.
- Who's the guy with the ears?

102
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,629
How're you doin'?
You could fly to Guam with those.

103
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,529
Uh, Airman Cronauer, sir.

104
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,939
You know, i-it wouldn't kill you people
to salute me once in a while.

105
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,120
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

106
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,529
I understand you're pretty funny
as a deejay, and...

107
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,459
well, comedy
is a kind of hobby of mine.

108
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,730
Well-- Well, actually, it's
a little more than just a hobby.

109
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,120
Reader's Digest is considering
publishing two of my jokes.

110
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,779
- Really?
- Yeah.

111
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,899
And perhaps some night we could
maybe get together and swap
humorous stories for-for fun.

112
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Oh, why not? Maybe play a couple
of Tennessee Ernie Ford records.
That'd be a hoot.

113
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,350
- That's a joke, right?
- Maybe.
- I get it.

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Where is this man's paperwork?

115
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,910
- Right here, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

116
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,579
United States Air Force.
The hat does give you away.

117
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,170
- This is not military issue, Airman.
What sort of uniform is that?
- Cretan camouflage.

118
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,839
If you want to blend into a crowd of
drunken Greeks, there's nothin' better.

119
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,689
That is humour.
I recognize that.

120
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,240
I also recognize
your species of soldier.

121
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,000
I had a guy like you in the field
one time. He blew himself to pieces.

122
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,449
But not before his humour cost the lives
of three very fine individuals.

123
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,579
- I hope--
- You shut your fuckin' hole!

124
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,689
You're in Southeast Asia now, pal.
You got your cushy little assignment.

125
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,170
There's nothin' I can
do about that.

126
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,600
In time, you will
make me forget it.

127
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,509
You stay out of my way,
there'll be no problem.

128
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,269
But if you toy with me,
I'll burn you so bad...

129
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,930
you'll wish you died as a child.

130
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,980
- Am I being fairly clear?
- Yes, sir.

131
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,709
"Sir"?
I work for a living, Airman.

132
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,790
You will address me
as Sergeant Major Dickerson.

133
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,319
Yes, Sergeant Major Dickerson.

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,950
He reminds me a lot of Donna Reed,
especially around the eyes.

135
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,080
Hello, hello, hello.

136
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,700
This is your chaplain,
Captain Noel...

137
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,440
your radio programme
of personal beliefs.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,879
Great and manifold
are our blessings today.

139
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,639
This great godly miracle
of radio...

140
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,409
really gives me the opportunity...

141
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,389
to speak to you on the air!

142
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,950
Sir, it's time to rise.

143
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,190
My God, it's Mardi Gras,
and I'm on the main float.

144
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,590
Come on, sir. Couple of weeks,
this will be easy for you.

145
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,009
- Oh, let me go back to bed.
- You gotta get up, sir.

146
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,059
God. What time is it, Edward?

147
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,549
- It's 5:30.
- 5:30. It's very early. I may have
to hurt you. Call me in five minutes.

148
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,360
No, you have to get up right now
and you have to get on the air.

149
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,080
- Oh. Fine. Fine.
- Come on, sir.

150
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,730
...has signed Les Crane
to a late-night talk show.

151
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,600
- This way, sir. It's just down
the hall and to the right.
- Yeah.

152
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,049
- You must be nervous, sir, huh?
- I'm not even in my body, Edward.

153
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,860
Don't worry about it.
It'll go great. This way, sir.

154
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,259
We still have a few minutes
before your show begins, sir.

155
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,169
When it's time to read the news, you
just take it off these machines here.

156
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,039
But regardless of what you read,
Airman, the Department
of Defence wants final say.

157
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,269
So every item's checked
by these two guys in here.

158
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,850
Guys, I'd like you to meet
our new deejay, Adrian Cronauer.

159
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,690
That's Marty Lee Dreiwitz.

160
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,360
He's impeccably clean.

161
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,720
This man has cleaning products
shipped in from Wisconsin.

162
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,559
He's also one of your roommates, so if
I were you, I'd think about suicide.

163
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,149
Sir, I-I really don't think that you
want to use any of those records, sir.

164
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,200
- We have a selection right here
that's prepared specifically--
- Hey, hey!

165
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,730
I've been looking forward to meeting
you. Listen, could you do me a favour?

166
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,590
- Can you say something funny
right this minute?
- I doubt it.

167
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,279
I'm with you, man.
I'm on your frequency.
Hey, let me ask you a question.

168
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,179
What is the appeal of Joey Bishop?

169
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,149
I mean, the man's not funny.
I know funny, and he's not funny.

170
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,659
Don't get me wrong. He seems like
a nice guy, but my father's a nice guy
and he's not funny either.

171
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Joey Bishop. I wish someone
would explain this one to me.

172
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,429
Hey, incidentally,
you're on the air in about ten seconds.
Nine, eight, seven, six--

173
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,289
Hey, this has been "Fiction and Fact"
from Marty Lee's almanac.
And now, direct from Crete...

174
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,490
welcome the silky-smooth sound
of Airman Adrian Cronauer.

175
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,129
Good morning, Vietnam!

176
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,389
Hey, this is not a test.
This is rock and roll.

177
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,440
Time to rock it
from the delta to the DMZ!

178
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,269
Is that me, or does that sound like
an Elvis Presley movie?

179
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,179
Viva Da Nang.
Oh, viva, Da Nang

180
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,389
Da Nang me, Da Nang me
Why don't they get a rope and hang me

181
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,480
Hey, is it a little too early
for being that loud? Hey, too late.

182
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,879
It's 0600. What's the "O" stand for?
Oh, my God, it's early.

183
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,460
Speaking of early, how about
that Cro-Magnon, Marty Dreiwitz?

184
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,019
Thank you, Marty, for "silky-smooth
sound." Make me sound like Peggy Lee.

185
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,370
"Good morning, Vietnam"?
What the heck is that supposed to mean?

186
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,070
I don't know, Lieutenant. I-I guess
it means, good morning, uh, Vietnam.

187
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,429
And who gave anyone permission
to programme modern music?

188
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,779
Freddy and the Dreamers!

189
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,740
Wrong speed.
We've got it on the wrong speed.

190
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,039
For those of you recovering from a
hangover, that's gonna sound just right.

191
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,990
Let's put her right back down.
Let's try it a little faster,
see if that picks it up a little bit.

192
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,669
Let's get it up on 78.

193
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,490
Those pilots are going,
"I really like the music. I really like
the music. I really like the music."

194
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,350
Oh, it's still a bad song. Hey,
wait a minute. Let's try something.

195
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,919
Let's play this backwards
and see if it gets any better.

196
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,690
Freddy is a devil.
Freddy is a devil.

197
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,600
Picture a man going on a journey
beyond sight and sound.

198
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,820
He's left Crete. He's entered
the demilitarized zone.

199
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,090
All right. Hey, what is this
"demilitarized zone"? What do
they mean, "police action"?

200
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,340
Sounds like a couple
of cops in Brooklyn going,
"You know, she looks pretty to me."

201
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,279
Hey, whatever it is, I like it
because it gets you on your toes better
than a strong cup of cappuccino.

202
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,330
What is a demilitarized zone? Sounds
like something out of The Wizard of Oz,

203
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,610
Oh, no, don't go in there.

204
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,440
Oh-we-oh
Ho Chi'Minh

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,460
Oh, look, you've landed in Saigon.

206
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,490
You're among
the little people now.

207
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,259
We represent the ARVN Army
The ARVN Army

208
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,379
Oh, no! Follow the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
Follow the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

209
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,490
"Oh, I'll get you, my pretty!" Oh, my
God. It's the wicked witch of the north.

210
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,389
It's Hanoi Hanna!

211
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,019
"Now, little GI, you and
your little 'tune-ooh' too!"

212
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:35,870
"Oh, Adrian. Adrian.
What are you doing, Adrian?"

213
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,450
Oh, Hanna, you slut. You've been down
on everything but the Titanic.
Stop it right now.

214
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,009
Uh, you know, he's really funny. You
know, he-he-- he's like a Marx brother.

215
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,629
Which Marx brother
would that be, Private? Zeppo?

216
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,070
- I don't find him funny at all.
- Zeppo? Isn't he the one with the hat?

217
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,029
Hey, uh, hi.
Can you help me? What's your name?
"My name's Roosevelt E. Roosevelt."

218
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:58,120
Roosevelt, what town are you stationed
in?. "I'm stationed in Poontang."

219
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,299
Well, thank you, Roosevelt.
What's the weather like out there?

220
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,629
"It's hot. Damn hot!
Real hot!

221
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,570
Hottest things is my shorts.
I could cook things in it.
A little crotch pot cooking."

222
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,679
Well, can you tell me what it feels
like. "Fool, it's hot! I told you again!

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,700
Were you born on the sun?
It's damn hot!

224
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,840
I saw-- It's so damn hot,
I saw little guys, their orange
robes burst into flames.

225
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,809
It's that hot!
Do you know what I'm talking about."

226
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
What do you think it's going to be like
tonight? "It's gonna be hot and wet!

227
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,870
That's nice if you're with a lady,
but it ain't no good
if you're in the jungle."

228
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,720
Thank you, Roosevelt. Here's a song
coming your way right now.

229
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,049
"Nowhere To Run To"
by Martha and the Vandellas.
Yes! Hey, you know what I mean!

230
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,600
Too much?

231
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,559
- Thank you, Marty.
"Silky-smooth sounds." Get outta here.
- Nowhere to run to, baby

232
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,809
Nowhere to hide

233
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,889
Got nowhere to run to, baby

234
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,960
Nowhere to hide

235
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,429
It's not love I'm a-runnin' from

236
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,029
It's the heartbreak
I know will come

237
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,419
'Cause I know you're no good for me

238
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,190
But you've becomes such apart of me

239
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,009
Everywhere I go your face I see

240
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,570
- Every step I take you take with me
- That is not what we programme here!

241
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,289
- Yeah, nowhere to run to, baby
- This is AFVN, rockin'ya
from the delta to the DMZ

242
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,559
AFVN-- better than AFVD, which means
you have to get a quick shot.

243
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,429
- We're movin' on right now.
- I get around

244
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,240
- I get around
- Get around, 'round, 'round
I get around

245
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,080
- From town to town
- Get around
- Here's a little riddle for you.

246
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,799
What's the difference between the Army
and the Cub Scouts?

247
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,409
- Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery.
- Get around, 'round, 'round
I get around

248
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,240
I'm gettin' bugged drivin' up
and down the same old strip

249
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,789
I gotta find a new place
where the kids are hip

250
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,250
Hey, I'm Adrian Cronauer.
I'm on again at 1600.

251
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,529
Why? Because I have to.
It's the Army.

252
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,710
We're talking out in the field today.
Hi, what's your name?
"My name's Bob Fliber!"

253
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,899
Bob, what do you do?
"I'm in artillery!" Thank you, Bob.

254
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,519
Can we play anything for you?
"Anything! Just play it loud! Okay?"

255
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,340
- I'm makin' real good bread
- Get around, 'round, 'round
I get around

256
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,399
- I get around,
- 'Round

257
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,740
Get around, 'round, 'round
Ooh

258
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,230
You know, I have to admit something
to you, I just came from Crete
with women that look like Zorba."

259
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,399
Whoo! Thank you.

260
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,389
"Those girls are just so pretty."
Gomer, are you here in Vietnam?

261
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,970
"Yes, I am.
Surprise, surprise, surprise!"

262
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,509
Lyndon, why did you name
your daughter "Linda Bird"?

263
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,860
"Cause Lynda Dog would be too cruel."
Easy, girl, easy.

264
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,269
"You know, if you pick 'em up by their
ears, it doesn't hurt 'em as much."

265
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,669
"Oh, you're goin'
straight to hell for that one!

266
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,500
Watch out o'er there!"
Here's an incredible coincidence.

267
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,090
Ho Chi Minh, Colonel Sanders--
actually the same person?

268
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,480
You be the judge, Our lines are open.
Somethin' real special now.

269
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,210
We've got our traffic report
up there on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
How's it goin'up there?

270
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,419
"Adrian, it's not goin'
exactly well.

271
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,830
There's a water buffalo jackknifed
up there. It's not a very pretty
picture. There's horns everywhere.

272
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,509
I don't know what to say.
We're gonna maybe drop in a little
napalm there and try 'n cook 'im down.

273
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,769
Have a little barbecue."

274
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,220
The purpose of a man
is to love a woman

275
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,559
And the purpose of a woman
is to love a man

276
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,450
So come on, baby, let's start today
Come on, baby, let's play

277
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,440
The game of love, love
la-la-la-la-la love

278
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:16,880
We've got a special man in the audience
today, Right now, it's Mr Leo.

279
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,599
He's a fashion consultant for the Army.
"Oh, thank you, Adrian.
I'm just very happy to be here.

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,829
I want to tell you something.
You know, this whole camouflage thing
for me doesn't work very well".

281
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,470
Why is that? "Well, because you go
in the jungle, I can't see you.

282
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,049
You know, it's like wearing
stripes and plaid. For me,
I want to do something different.

283
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,470
You know, you go in the jungle,
make a statement.
If you're going to fight, clash.

284
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,470
- You know what I mean?"
- come on, baby, the time is right
Love your daddy with all your might

285
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,930
Thank you for that lovely tune.
That funky music
will drive us till the dawn.

286
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,309
Let's go.
Let's boogaloo till we puke.

287
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,970
That's about it
for the Adrian Cron Hour.

288
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,839
I'm gonna take myself
out of the driver's seat, but I'm
gonna turn you over right now...

289
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,210
to Mr Excitement,
a man with limp, damaged hair,
but nevertheless a fireball...

290
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,170
Dan Levitan!

291
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,220
This is AFRS, Radio Saigon,
and yours truly...

292
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,509
Dan "The Man" Levitan.

293
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,920
Greetings and salutations
to any and all servicemen in the area...

294
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,619
and thanks so much
for joining us.

295
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,630
Yeah! Yeah!

296
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,759
Yeah, he's funny! I know funny.
This guy is funny!

297
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,940
Sensational!

298
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:30,369
- At ease!
- Hell, we already are.

299
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,750
Just cool your tongue, Airman,
because I intend to take issue
with your performance.

300
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,859
First of all, don't make fun
of the weather here.

301
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:43,299
And don't say that the weather
is the same all the time here,
because it's not.

302
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,049
- In fact, it's two degrees
cooler today than yesterday.
- Two degrees cooler?

303
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,240
Me without my muff.

304
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:53,519
- Muff! I tell you, this guy's funny.
- I'm trying to run a meeting here.

305
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,750
You know, I hate the fact
that you people never salute me.

306
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,500
I am a lieutenant,
and I would like salutes occasionally.

307
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,410
That's what being a higher rank
is all about.

308
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,529
Second--

309
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,569
- Second--
- Programming taste.

310
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,799
Programming taste.

311
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,650
Frankly, I found your "I love
a police action" remark way out of line.

312
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,950
How can you have the gall to compare
the conflict here in Vietnam...

313
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
with a glass
of cappuccino coffee?

314
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:23,230
Well, I was-- It just comes up.
I was trying to be funny.

315
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,170
- Funny is good. Funny is good.
- Yeah.

316
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,640
But then do it by using
comedy and humour...

317
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,700
not police action
and coffee remarks.

318
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,420
Furthermore, you are to stick
to playing normal modes of music...

319
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,609
not wild stuff.

320
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,599
Those we would find acceptable here
would include Lawrence Welk...

321
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,339
Jim Nabors, Mantovani.

322
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,619
- Percy Faith.
- Percy Faith. Good!

323
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Andy Williams, Pery Como and
certain ballads by Mr Frank Sinatra.

324
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,529
- Would Bob Dylan be out of line?
- Way, way, way out of line.

325
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,269
Former VP Richard Nixon
will arrive here this week.

326
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,440
Dreiwitz, I've assigned you
to cover the PC.

327
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,759
- He likes to say PC
instead of press conference.
- And if you do hap--

328
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,650
- The lieutenant loves to abbreviate.
- And if you do-- And if you do--

329
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,710
And if you do happen to speak with him,
please be polite and to the point
at all times.

330
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:19,319
- Affirmative, sir.
- "Affirmative, sir." Good.

331
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:24,539
Okay. Who do we have slated
for live entertainment in November?

332
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,509
Well, we originally wanted Bob Hope,
but it turns out he won't come.

333
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,910
- Why not?
- He doesn't play police actions,
just wars.

334
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,039
Bob likes a big room, sir.

335
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,930
- That is not funny!
- How 'bout if it escalated?

336
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,740
- How about if what escalated?
- The Vietnam conflict.

337
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,039
The Vietnam conflict.

338
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,380
We are not going to escalate
a whole war just so we can
book a big-name comedian!

339
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,180
We can get Tony Bennett
or Trini Lopez.

340
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,630
I got it. Jery Vale.
He closes the Copa on the 18th.

341
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:06,769
- Is that date firm?
- I got it from my niece.

342
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,720
Oh, come on. This is not the Catskills.
Get somebody good. Get The Beach Boys.

343
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,220
- Don't dick around here.
- Oh, we tried, but their agent says
they're still on the beach...

344
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,170
and they won't be off the sand
till November! Ba-da-bing!

345
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,759
Uh, well, didn't somebody
wearing my uniform and bearing
a striking resemblance to myself...

346
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:24,049
just say that that kind of music
was inappropriate?

347
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,470
Sorry, sir.
I haven't been to sleep.

348
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,670
The former VP
will be here on Friday.

349
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,720
I expect every minute of the VP's PC
to be taped and broadcast...

350
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,450
within 12 hours of his arrival.

351
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,630
Something funny, Garlick?
Well, perhaps you'd like to
share it with the rest of us.

352
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,759
No, sir. The former vice president
is a delight, sir.

353
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:47,349
Excuse me, sir. Seeing as how
the VP is such a VIP...

354
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,279
shouldn't we keep the PC on the QT,
'cause if it leaks to the VC...

355
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:53,609
he could end up an MIA,
and then we'd all be put on KP.

356
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,309
- I would like to leave the room now.
- Oh, uh, yes, sir.

357
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,779
Oh, what a dip.

358
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,269
If you d-d-d-do--

359
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,259
- And if you do--
- And if you do--

360
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:28,440
Eddie Kirk here, and Ray Conniff jubilee
coming up in just a few moments.

361
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,009
I call it a jubilee.
Actually, it's a Ray Conniff featurette.

362
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:36,250
Three, maybe four,
back-to-back Ray Conniff classics.

363
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:00,039
We're here, sir. Jimmy Wah's.

364
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,390
This is the place where we
like to hang out, sir.

365
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,109
Real horny,
in an opium kind of way.

366
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:11,269
- Earl! Earl! Earl!
- That's Jimmy Wah. He owns the place.

367
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,079
Hi! Hi! Hi!
Hi! Hi!

368
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,269
- Now you say hi to me, then you smile.
- Hi.

369
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,180
Hey, you two Earl.
What about couple beer?

370
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,509
We'd love a couple
of beers, Jimmy.

371
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,789
- Are either of our names "Earl"?
- He calls everybody Earl.

372
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,759
Is it me, or is Jimmy
light in the loafers?

373
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,640
Let me put it to you this way.
He's got this thing for Walter Brennan.

374
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,490
He says he wants to
buy naked photographs of the actor.

375
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,200
- For three years he's been trying.
- Walter Brennan?

376
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,720
You know, Walter Brennan
from The Real McCoys, the TV show?

377
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,460
Well, well, well, Luke.
Well, well.

378
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,279
Anyway, there's this guy from
the 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry...

379
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,309
who swore that he could get him
naked photographs of the actor.

380
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,579
And I've been trying to tell him that
it's no-go, but he won't listen to me.

381
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,420
- Oh, God. Nude photographs
of Walter Brennan.
- Here your beer.

382
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,609
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- Right.

383
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,200
Any movement on the
Walter Brennan thing?

384
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,569
No, and it doesn't
look good, Jimmy.

385
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,660
He looks good to me.

386
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,319
Ba Muy Ba beer
best beer in Vietnam.

387
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,660
Ba Muy Ba beer
only beer in Vietnam.

388
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,140
Try it.

389
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,549
- Oh, what happened?
- What happened?

390
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:25,190
Formaldehyde. We put in just a touch
of formaldehyde for flavour.

391
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,490
Some people get sick, yeah.

392
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,640
So if you have to be rushed
to a hospital, then when you return...

393
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,880
- I give you a free salad.
- Well, that seems fair. It really does.

394
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,220
- You'll get used to it.
- Maybe.

395
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:42,140
- There she is. Ahh. Any girl who wants
me this bad, I can't let her down.
- Where you goin'?

396
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,289
- The hunt is on.
- What is wrong?
- Ah--

397
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:47,339
- I gotta catch her
before she accelerates.
- You can't go yet.

398
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,460
You have to taste my spicy chicken,
cooked with ex--

399
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,009
Hi. How's Lynn doing?

400
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,470
I'm sorry. You look
like Lynn's friend from Toledo.

401
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,940
Listen, let me make it up to you
by buying a cup of coffee. Also,
tea would fall into that category.

402
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,250
I not think be not correct of way.
Please. Okay?

403
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,549
- What'd she just say?
- She said no, sir.

404
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,220
But, Edward, I'm in love.
You think she likes seafood?

405
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,970
Um-- She's getting away. Edward,
Edward, get the Jeep! Get the Jeep!

406
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,180
Okay. It's-It's
blocked in by a truck.

407
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:19,180
- You can stay here, sir.
I'll talk to the guys, okay?
- We don't have time. Taxi!

408
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,200
- Ahh-- Bikes!
We'll buy bikes. Si habla Yiddish?
- We won't buy bikes.

409
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,009
- There's actually
no rubber on these tyres.
- Oh, picky, picky.

410
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,329
Let's go, Edward!
Yaah, the chase!

411
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,579
Sir! Sir, we have to get some
dignity here! A little dignity.

412
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,500
Sir! Sir, this is--
This is not safe.

413
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,670
Sir!

414
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:53,089
Sir! Sir!

415
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,180
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Mr Sloan.

416
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:48,599
Uh, the last-- last time, in our
last class, we read chapter three.

417
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,519
You should've gotten the one
with the training wheels, pal.

418
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,349
I was almost killed.

419
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,380
A truck's bumper
was this far from my nose.

420
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:00,930
My whole life passed before my eyes
and it wasn't even interesting to me.

421
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,069
How am I gonna get to first base
with this girl?

422
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:08,410
I want to buy some butter
and some cheese, please.

423
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,250
It zoomed right by,
just like the way they say it does.

424
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,710
Stamp collections, pulling chickweeds
from my dad's dichondra plants...

425
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:18,059
arranging rakes by sizes
for my mom in the garage.

426
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,069
Even encapsulated in two seconds,
my life is dull.

427
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:24,029
- I find that very alarming.
- Edward, stay with me on this.

428
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,059
- How am I gonna get this girl
to go out with me?
- You're not.

429
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,599
This is a very different culture.
You would need very specifc...

430
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,400
family-sanctioned introductions
in order to talk to this girl.

431
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,289
- Shh! Listen.
- We read not having in book.

432
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,940
It read-- read for my...

433
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,279
- the book.
- I've never heard rhymes like that.

434
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,109
I've got to be with her,
at least till she learns my name.

435
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,250
- You think the teacher'd
be able to date her?
- Possibly.

436
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,170
- But you would need very...
- That's just what I wanted to hear.

437
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,670
specifc introductions.

438
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,029
What we're going
to talk about today is shopping.

439
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,269
Shopping for dinner, and the things you
buy during, uh-- in your shopping trip.

440
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,849
Specifically--
Excuse me.

441
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,470
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I have two months to live...

442
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,589
and I would like to teach
before I die.

443
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,859
I don't think you understand me,
Sparky.

444
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,509
It's all yours.
You got it.

445
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,890
Hello, class.
My name is Adrian Cronauer.

446
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,490
I'd like to get to know
all of you by having you
write down your name, address...

447
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,609
and your home and work phone on a
piece of paper and passing it forward.

448
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,150
Sergeant Sloan our teacher.
You not supposed to be in here.

449
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,519
I was sent here on very
strict orders from a colonel.

450
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,880
First thing I'd like to know is,
what subject this is.

451
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,359
- Is it English?
- Yes, it is.

452
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,180
And how lucky for me.
Thank you very much for playing.

453
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,220
Now, let's start off with the fact
that English is a fantastic language.

454
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,460
Let's try a little phrase,
uh, I like to call...

455
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:02,670
"My boyfriend's back
and there's gonna be trouble.
Hey-nah, hey-nah, my boyfriend's back."

456
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,140
Can we try that one?

457
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,599
Can we try "My boyfriend's back"?
Anybody?

458
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,470
This is not for you.

459
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,970
Why do I feel like
the Miracle Worker up here?

460
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,859
- This is a nightmare.
- Uh, I don't know dick.

461
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,509
Even saying that means
I don't know dick. I--

462
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,319
I can't really teach English.
That's what Sergeant Sloan's going
to do when he comes back.

463
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,859
I can only tell ya
about how you can talk on,
maybe, the real streets of America.

464
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,329
Like, if you're walking on the streets
of New York and someone says, "Hey!

465
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,289
Excuse me. I would like to buy
some cheese and some butter."

466
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,990
No. No, come on.

467
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,950
Basically, we talk, "Hey, man,
what's happening? Ahh, you look
hip today. Slip me some skin."

468
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,180
Now, if someone in
America comes up and says, "Hey,
slip me some skin," don't be afraid.

469
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,519
They're not a leper,
and they're not gonna go--

470
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,210
No. It means, "Hey, baby,
slip me some skin." It's a greeting.

471
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,920
It's like, "How're you doin'?
Nice to meet you. Slip me some skin."

472
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,940
Now, here's how you do it.
You say, "Slip me some skin."
Put your hand out there.

473
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:01,779
Then you go, "Yeah, there's some skin."
Now you do it to me.

474
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,059
Yeah! Then you say,
"Groovy. Yeah."

475
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,769
- Say that.
- Groovy.

476
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,700
Yes! Baby!

477
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,220
If something's really nice,
you say, "It's groovy."

478
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,220
Doesn't mean you're going like,
"Yo!" No. It means "groovy."

479
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,500
Try that one. Say, "Hey, baby,
what's happening? Let's groove."

480
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,430
Hey, baby, wh-wh-wh-wh-what's
happening? Let's groove.

481
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,339
- See you later.
- Mr Cronauer, I really liking you.

482
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,980
- Well, I'm liking you too.
- Thank you.

483
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,069
- You teach, um, uh,
American thing, okay?
- Okay.

484
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,230
- Play game of softball.
- Okay, yeah, well, we'll try
and do that if we get the equipment.

485
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,460
- You forget the girl.
- Whoa. I'll let her say no.

486
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,279
She is say no. That is what walking
away from you means.

487
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,170
- I'm interested in the girl. I'm not
interested in you playing Dear Abby.
- I know because she's my sister.

488
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,849
I would, however, love to buy you lunch,
maybe look at a family album. Come on.

489
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,500
- I not like you, sir.
- Why not?

490
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,420
I got a great personality.
You ask anybody.

491
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,059
You phoney, like American
and French before you.

492
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,609
Here to get something,
leaving when you not get it.

493
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,269
You come into my class,
so maybe we like you.

494
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,450
- You come for the girl.
You won't get her. You go.
- Okay, Sherlock.

495
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,980
Yeah, I bribed my way to
meet the girl. You got me, bang.

496
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,539
But hey, I like the class. I'm gonna
stay. Let's be friends, okay? Come on.

497
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,039
- Come on. Come on.
- You like me because of my sister.

498
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,160
No, I like you because you're honest,
because you're shorter than I am.

499
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,380
We look like a before and after picture.
Now, come on. Let me buy you a beer.

500
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,009
Sometimes your face look like a fish
in the Gulf of Thailand.

501
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,660
It's true. It's very true.
That's an insult, isn't it?

502
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,759
You can buy me lunch,
but please forget about my sister.

503
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,190
I know Americans.

504
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,579
See a girl with the type breasts they
like and they put her in a fancy car...

505
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,420
and they buy her some expensive food
and then lie about money.

506
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,420
- And then try and take her into a bed.
- So, what's wrong with that?

507
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,299
It's more devout here.

508
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,960
- Is there any food on this street
that doesn't give you diarrhoea?
- You wanting some?

509
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,230
What the hell is this?

510
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,460
Oh, she pour Nuoc Mahmm
noodle soup with fish ball.

511
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,380
- Didn't know they had balls.
- Eat.

512
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,369
Eat. I can't.
It's still paddling.

513
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,809
No, it okay. I not tell you okay
otherwise. You like it.

514
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,049
You see?
You don't trusting me.

515
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,059
I trust you, man.
It's just that I can't eat something
that looks like a cesspool.

516
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,259
You mad I not trust you,
but truth, you not trust me.

517
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,750
You want be my friend,
you trusting me. You eat it.

518
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,839
Hey, I'll-I'll be-- I wanna be
your pal. Here, okay. I'll eat it.

519
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,720
Dig in. Mm-mm.

520
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,859
Jesus! Shit! God!

521
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,619
Oh! Hot!
My-- Ow! Shit!

522
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,210
- This stuff is burning
the hair of my feet!
- Hot?

523
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,819
Hot? No.
It's fuckin' great.

524
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,369
- She say it's a little spicy.
- A little, yeah.

525
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,009
Isn't that funny?
You like that too?

526
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,250
A little of this? Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!
She likes the Three Stooges.

527
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,789
Hey, Moe! Hey, Moe!

528
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:07,539
- Oh, you are being silly.
- Ohh!

529
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,440
- You old enough for this place?
- I think so.

530
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,740
Hi, Earl!
Good to see you again!

531
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,380
- Look at the new friend.
- A little too young for you.

532
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,240
I want to show you
something very nice.

533
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,779
- Oh, really?
- It look wonderful.

534
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,740
- I can confide you?
- Sure.

535
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,400
Look at the shape
of that soldier ankle...

536
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,869
the way it so elegantly
curve into his boot.

537
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,359
Help me get some photo
of those ankle, I give you my bar.

538
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,279
- You're a very sick man.
You know that, don't you?
- Ahh!

539
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,900
Thank you.

540
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,079
Oh, God.

541
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,869
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the new voice of Saigon...

542
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,910
Adrian Cronauer!

543
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,970
Not enough for the car.

544
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,170
- What happened with the girl?
- It didn't work out.

545
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,930
I want to introduce you to someone
right now from my English class.

546
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,610
- This is Tuan. The guys.
- Hey, Tuan!

547
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,329
- Guys, Tuan.
- Hey, pull up a floor here.

548
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,059
Hi, Tuan.
Long time no "twee." Ba-dum.

549
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,909
- That's terrible. That's terrible.
- Those are gorgeous gals.

550
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,570
I've-- I'll never have them.

551
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,550
I've always wanted girls like that,
but I've always had trouble,
especially as a young child.

552
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,519
Who the hell gets laid as a young
child? And stop calling them "gals."

553
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,710
Cowgirls are called gals. Those are
gorgeous French-Vietnamese B-girls.

554
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,650
Don't ruin it by conjuring up images
of Dale Evans, all right?

555
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,199
Can you believe the shape
of those gals-- girls?

556
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,050
The one in blue.

557
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,539
Those behinds were designed by a Jewish
scientist in Switzerland, Dr Feintush.

558
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,570
- Dr Heimlich Feintush.
- We're trying to figure out
how to meet them...

559
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,989
- but nobody can come up
with any good lines.
- Wait a minute. Try this one.
Try this one.

560
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,230
Oh, girls, girls!
Come on over.

561
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,690
Pardon me, girls?
Excuse me, girls? Hello.

562
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,780
Hello! Come on. Yes.

563
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,099
Here she comes
Miss Southeast Asia

564
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,329
- It says we're not supposed to
fraternize with these girls.
- Here she comes right now

565
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,380
- It says so in the memo.
"No fraternizing with these girls."
In the memo!
- Thank you.

566
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,260
- I will note your objection.
- Forget memos. Forget memos.
These are pretty women coming.

567
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,699
Here she comes

568
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,760
- This way, please.
- Hi.

569
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,309
Hello, I'm William Holden.

570
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,809
- Oh. Oh! Bingo.
- Merry Christmas.

571
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,300
Merry Christmas.
If you believe in Santa--

572
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,530
- How come I don't get one?
- Dan Levitan. You've probably
heard my radio show.

573
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,239
What's your name?
My name is Levitan. Can you say that?

574
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,670
Hey, who brought in the gook?

575
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,860
I said, who brought in
the fuckin' gook?

576
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,610
I love you.

577
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,809
- A khaki eclipse.
- I better go now.

578
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,780
That's all right.
I did. Hey, come on now.

579
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,360
If you kick out the gooks, the next
thing, you have to kick out the chinks,
the spicks, the spooks and kikes.

580
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,860
All that's gonna be left in here
are a couple of brain-dead rednecks.

581
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,980
- And what fun would that be?
- Now's when they stop talking.

582
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,400
- Now, come on. Let me buy you
a couple of beers. How 'bout it?
- What, are you crazy?

583
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,329
- I might b--
- Shut up!
- Okay.
- Get him outta here.

584
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,860
Hey!

585
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,159
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on now.

586
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,039
- You gotta prove somethin', knockin'
around little Vietnamese kids here?
- This is a GI bar.

587
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,190
We don't like gooks. We don't want
him here. You just get him out!

588
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,179
Everybody say "gook,"
but it's all right.

589
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,690
-Jump in anytime, okay?
- We're there.

590
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,769
I got to tell you somethin',
you know?

591
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,260
I've been all around the world, seen
a lot of places and a lot of people.

592
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,329
I have never ever in my travels
come across a man as large as you...

593
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,050
with as much muscles,
who has absolutely no penis.

594
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,409
Ooh!

595
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,969
He mean that as compliment!

596
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,559
Oh, shit!

597
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,900
That's it for you, asshole!

598
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,429
Call police, quick!

599
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,230
Talk.

600
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,349
These two behemoths were physically
abusing a Vietnamese national. I thought
since we were here to defend their cou--

601
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,119
So you start a brawl. Turn the place
upside-down. Real intelligent solution.

602
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,849
Do you have any idea how
ridiculous it makes me look to
have a man under my command...

603
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,469
start a fucking bar brawl?

604
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,190
You're not gonna
last long here, pal.

605
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,539
- You can always
send me back to Crete.
- Oh, you think this is a joke?

606
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:34,969
I can come up with alternatives
other than Crete. I'm real good
at stuff like that.

607
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,289
I got people stuck in places
they haven't even considered
how to get out of yet.

608
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,489
You don't think I can
come up with somethin' good?

609
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,630
- Can you envision some fairly
unattractive alternatives?
- Not without slides.

610
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,699
A bar brawl.
That's one, Cronauer.

611
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,150
You better stay cool. You better
not get involved in anything.

612
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,710
You better not even come within range
of anything that happens...

613
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:58,690
or your ass is grass,
and I'm a lawn mower.

614
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,900
- Am I being fairly clear?
- Yes, sir.

615
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,670
"Sir"? Do you see anything on
this uniform indicating an officer?

616
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,860
- What does three up and three down
mean to you, Airman?
- End of an inning?

617
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,130
Sergeant Major.

618
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,829
Now, you get the hell
out of here right now.

619
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,159
Jesus. Enough.
Please, I'm-- Ba-- Bag it!

620
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:35,519
Wake up, Mr Sleepy Head.
You are late.

621
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,309
Gentlemen, what can I say
but "hiya."

622
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,010
- Hiya.
- Hiya.

623
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,320
Okay, which one of you guys
is throwing his voice?

624
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,940
Oh, censor, censor, censor.
Join the Army and mark things.

625
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,360
Hey, come on. What kind of
news are you leaving me there?

626
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,570
Nixon, Singapore,
Lake Erie. Come on.

627
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,909
Come on. You're on
in, like, two seconds.

628
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,900
It's time for Adrian Cronauer.

629
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,019
Good morning, Vietnam!

630
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,050
Hello, campers.
Remember, Monday is malaria day.

631
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,829
That's right. Time to take that
big orange pill and get ready
for the Ho Chi Minh two-step.

632
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,110
Sugar and spice
and all things nice

633
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,920
Kisses sweeter than wine

634
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,420
Sugar and spice
and all things nice

635
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,510
You know that little girl is mine

636
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,150
Everybody stops
and stares at my baby

637
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,099
We're back. Here's the news.
All the news that's new
and approved by the US Army...

638
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,829
the sweetest-smelling army
in the world.

639
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,159
Great Britain recognized
the island state of Singapore.

640
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,239
How do you recognize an island? Do you
go, exc-- Hey, wait. No, don't tell me.

641
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,960
Wait, wait. Didn't we meet last year
at the Feinman bar mitzvah?

642
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,440
You look a lot like Hawaii.
Didn't we meet last year
at the Peninsula Club? No.

643
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,550
Pope Paul VI
celebrated a mass in Italian.
Whoa! Call me crazy! He's in Rome.

644
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,230
You know, one day I want to meet him,
kiss his ring, and have it go, whrrr!

645
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,789
The Mississippi River broke through
a protective dike today.

646
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,599
What is-- What is a protective dike?
Is that a large woman standing by
the river going, "Don't go near there"?

647
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,699
"But Betty--" "Don't go near there.
Get away from the river.
Stay away from there."

648
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,119
I know we can't use the word "dyke." You
can't even say "lesbian." It's women in
comfortable shoes. Thank you very much.

649
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,840
Now here's the weather. We're gonna
go right to Roosevelt E. Roosevelt.
Roosevelt, how's it going?

650
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:37,320
"Adrian, I'm with somebody. Don't even
come here and bother me right now."

651
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,739
- Well, thanks, Roosevelt.
Can't you give us a little weather?
- "Not now, man.

652
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,929
I'm on the balcony,
I'm trying to score. Back off."

653
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,059
Well, what's the weather like?
"You got a window? Open it."

654
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:46,119
Thank you, Roosevelt. We'll have to
go to someone else for the weather.

655
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,210
I guess we'll have to go all the way
to Washington Weather Central
to Walter Cronkite.
Walter, what's the weather like?

656
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,860
"I just want to begin by saying
to Roosevelt E. Roosevelt...

657
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,769
'What it is, what it shall be,
what it was.'

658
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,400
Weather out there today
is hot and shitty...

659
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,030
with continued hot and shitty
in the afternoon.

660
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,300
Tomorrow a chance of continued
crappy with a pissy weather
front coming down from the north.

661
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:09,809
Basically, it's hotter than
a snake's ass in a wagon round-up."

662
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,019
Okay, we're gonna hit some songs
at you right now. Comin' your way!

663
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,820
What the hell was that?
Crappy weather, shitty weather?

664
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:21,219
- Comedy, sir.
- Comedy? No, no. This is not comedy.

665
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,199
- Comedy is fun, it's antics,
hysterical-type things.
- Hysterical-type things?

666
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,510
- Airman Cronauer
requesting you to elaborate, sir.
- Antics, damn it.

667
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,599
Comedy of errors, like
the Keystone Cops falling down.
General wackiness like that.

668
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,230
Falling down, that's a sight gag.
How would anyone see you
fall down on the radio, sir?

669
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,579
- No, no, no, no.
Not literally falling down.
- Definitely wouldn't worth
on the radio, sir.

670
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,750
- See, sir?
- What I mean is in the spirit
of the Keystone Cops.

671
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,710
- Sir, it wouldn't worth, I don't think,
- I don't think anybody would
see you fall through a radio, sir.

672
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,469
- I-I-I-I-- If a field radio--
- What are you doing here?

673
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,619
- Well, I thought I'd come
and help smooth things out--
- Don't help and don't smooth.

674
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,289
And you-- You are not funny,
but you are a maniac...

675
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,949
and you'd better start
changing your life.

676
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,530
Sir?

677
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,699
Thank you for that
constructive criticism. It's--

678
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,039
It's a privilege to take comedy notes
from a man of your stature.

679
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,519
Fine. Just don't
let it happen again.

680
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,400
Whoa.

681
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,190
In the dictionary under "asshole,"
it says "See him."

682
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,400
Why am I here? All right, we're gonna
play some music for you right now.

683
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,739
Here we go. Here's a little
James Brown comin' yourway.

684
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,519
Baby, help me, please.

685
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,519
Whoa, I feel good

686
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,449
I knew that I would, now

687
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,750
I feel good

688
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,440
I knew that I would, now

689
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,420
So good
So good

690
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,670
I got you

691
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,570
- Ow
- Ow! Ow! Back again.

692
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,050
When I hold you in my arms

693
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,960
I know that I can do no wrong

694
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,349
And when I hold you my arms

695
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,739
My love can't do me no harm

696
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,650
And I feel nice
Like sugar and spice

697
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,190
I feel nice

698
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,809
- Like sugar and spice
- Sugar and spice!

699
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,739
- So nice
- So nice!

700
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,409
- So nice
- So good!
- I got you

701
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,900
- I feel good
- Tell 'em, James. Hurt 'em now.

702
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,300
- I knew that I would, now
- Good God, help me!
Work through it. Ow!

703
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,039
I feel good

704
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,750
I knew that I would

705
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:46,119
So good
So good

706
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,679
- Sir, Walter Cronkite
lives in New Jersey.
- It was a joke, sir.

707
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,039
- Yes!
- Sarcasm, sir.
- Up in Bergen Country.

708
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,690
-That's a form of humour, sir.
Yes, sir.
- Oh, it's Hackensack!

709
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:58,159
- Yes, sir.
- How do I know?
- I'll make sure he gets the message.

710
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:01,969
- We're pretty happy with him,
too, sir. Thank you.
- Yes, I'm sure that wasn't
Walter Cronkkite, sir.

711
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,699
- I will tell him, sir.
- Didn't I speak to you before?
- Okay, sir. Thank you.

712
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,610
Very good! All right, now.
All right. Let's recap now. Okay.

713
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,840
- If someone is not telling the truth,
you say that they are full of--
- Shit!

714
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,440
- Shit.
- Yes! Okay.

715
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,860
If someone is making you angrier
and angrier, therefore you have--

716
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:25,500
- Pissed me off.
- Pissed me off!

717
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,500
Okay. Join the others if you can.
All right. Let's see--

718
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,619
If you say that, hey, some people in
a car-- some gypsies, they cut you off.

719
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,420
- All of a sudden you--
- Flip them the bird.
- The bird!

720
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,170
Very good. Okay. Now we got
a special situation right now.

721
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,530
Okay, there's a Puerto Rican waitress.
She comes over, brings you
a little thing of red soup.

722
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:49,460
She's got some tomato soup.
Oh, she slips, she spills it...

723
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:52,849
on your brand-new gabardine pants that
you paid more than a colour TV for.

724
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,300
- You're a little angry,
so you say to her-- Minh?
- Uh, look what you did...

725
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:00,320
and god damn it
and stupid and crap.

726
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,739
That's stupid.
You don't call someone crap.

727
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,340
No, you step on crap.
You don't call it to a person.

728
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,769
- You can step on crap. I know you can.
- Yes, but they can be full of shit.
He said.

729
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,449
No, no. You see, you-you-you step
in shit. You can be full of crap.

730
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,139
I'm pretty sure you can step in crap.
I once saw it in a French movie.

731
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,900
How can some person look like a shit?
It impossible.

732
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,960
I think-- Okay, let's stop with the--
We can stop with the debate
on the great ca-ca right now.

733
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:24,929
Let's try a very special situation.
Wilkie, somethin' special, okay?
You go into a restaurant okay?

734
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:28,190
A waitress comes up to you. You're, eh--
You're wearing your best new suit.

735
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,380
She comes up, she spills soup
all over you, looks at you like...

736
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,400
"Eh, I'm sorry.
What are you gonna do about it,
asshole?" What do you say to her?

737
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:38,510
What would you say? They spilled
something on your pants. What would
they do? What would you do?

738
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,119
I do nothing.

739
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:48,949
Come on, Wilkie. It's cursing class.
You're gettin' a little pissed off.
What would you do?

740
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:51,309
I just remain reticent.

741
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,360
Okay, she goes in the kitchen, she gets
a knife, she starts stabbing you.

742
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,960
She's stabbing you.
She's putting forks in you.
She's got spoons in your eyes, Wil.

743
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:01,730
They're startin' to cut you with knives.
They're puttin' spoons in your eyes.
What would you do, Wil?

744
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:05,409
- What would you do?
- I'm waiting to die.

745
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:11,980
Mr Cronauer, we like your lessons
better than the book's.

746
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,369
- When we play baseball?
- When you teaching us softball?

747
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,280
Well, first we have to have
a little spring training, and when
I think you're ready, I'll try.

748
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,619
- Where are you come from?
- Queens. Bayside, Queens.

749
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,389
- What are Queens?
- Tall, thin men who like show tunes.

750
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,349
No? Big men with moustaches
named May who wear mascara.

751
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:34,469
Yeah, lakai'?

752
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,730
What is a lakai'?

753
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,239
Relax, already, crazy American.

754
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,679
- I make a date with you
and Trinh tomorrow.
- You did?

755
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:51,900
Nearby the larch tree, near Viet Hoa,
by the food and flower vendors where you
burn your mouth on the noodles.

756
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,670
- Where's that?
- The noodles, remember?

757
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,489
- When you burn your mouth.
- Oh, gosh, yeah.
- But I warn you: you not like it
when you get there.

758
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:02,780
- You say it ridiculous.
- Why? That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

759
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,320
- Hi.
- Hi!

760
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,690
Oh, God.
This could be very ugly. Hi.

761
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:12,909
Chaperons.

762
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,329
In Vietnam, family often come...

763
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,099
to meet someone--
to meet someone.

764
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,050
Hello. Hey.
Well, the gang's all here, huh?

765
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:25,559
Oh, God, help me.
This is wonderful.

766
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:28,599
Well, you know,
you're very beautiful.

767
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,000
You're also very quiet.

768
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:36,329
And I'm not used to girls being
that quiet unless they're medicated.

769
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,340
Normally I go out with girls
who talk so much you could
hook 'em up to a wind turbine...

770
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,260
and they could power
a small New Hampshire town.

771
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,550
You talk, I think, very much.

772
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:50,070
Well, you--you see, I'm not used to
going on a date with a grand jury,
and it makes me a little nervous.

773
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,230
Oh. I don't want makes
you nervous, "Cronow."

774
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,300
I knows you very nice.

775
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:01,159
And for trusting,
you is the best...

776
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:03,840
on the gently of what you say...

777
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,699
or never to be for both
the same and another.

778
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:13,039
Well, I had you there, babe,
but then you lost me at the end.

779
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,409
Hey, hey.
Hey, Uncle Phil.

780
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,039
Hey, there you go. Whoa!
Got one for you.

781
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:26,809
Hey, there we go. For you.
Here we go. For you.

782
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,650
Knock yourselves out.

783
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,500
What's 1/13th of a dollar
among friends? Come on.

784
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,380
No problem.
It's-- They're havin' a great--

785
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,639
Hey, listen,
I know there's no way.

786
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:50,730
But it doesn't mean
we can't have a few laughs.

787
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,599
Hey, I'll take
whatever you can give...

788
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,130
'cause I'm just happy
to be with you.

789
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,619
You want to see a movie
or somethin'?

790
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:03,230
- We must to ask the people.
- Hey, that's no problem.

791
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,920
Attention, shoppers.
People. People, settle.

792
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,210
"Under the Boardwalk"?
You know that one?

793
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:12,139
"Shout" by the Isley Brothers.
You know that?

794
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:16,079
- You know any American songs at all?
- "Puff the Magic Dragon."

795
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,969
You know "Puff the Magic Dragon"?
Can you sing it?

796
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,190
Puff the Magic Dragon

797
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:25,150
- Living by the tree
- That's wonderful.

798
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:28,250
Hey. Twelve, please. Um--

799
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,329
Take a blanket made for two now

800
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:36,000
Add a boy and a girl

801
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,019
That's a game for me and you now

802
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,969
Yeah, let's give it a whirl

803
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,710
Beach blanket bingo

804
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:47,730
Beach blanket bingo

805
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,469
Beach blanket bingo

806
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,599
That's the name of the game

807
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:11,739
My thoughts exactly.

808
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,440
Why can't I read this?
It's what's goin' on here now.

809
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,860
- They'd never approve
of that being released.
- That's censorship, Edward.

810
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:36,829
- That's not what America's all about.
- We're not in America, sir.

811
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:39,769
Can we please not get into this right
now? You're in the middle of a show.

812
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,210
Jesus, you could put amphetamine freaks
to sleep with this shit.

813
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,590
Got an "Agreement on Guam"?
Sounds like bird droppings.
Oh, here's somethin' exciting.

814
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:48,130
"Hubert Humphrey visits Capitol Hill."
Sounds like a children's story.

815
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,250
- That's it. I'm readin' this.
- No, I can't let you do that.

816
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:52,480
Oh, Edward, don't you ever do
anything that's not by the book?

817
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,530
Not when I get into trouble.
No, I don't.

818
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,030
You know, Eddie, sometimes
you got to specifically go out
of your way to get into trouble.

819
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:01,000
It's called fun.
What's that? Come on.

820
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:03,679
Take some chances once in a while,
Edward. That's what life's all about.

821
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,900
- Find anything?
- No, I'll have to make somethin' up.

822
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:13,309
Hey, we're back. That last two seconds
of silence was Marcel Marceau's newest
hit single, "Walkin In The Wind."

823
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:16,920
And now here are the headlines.

824
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,949
Ah! Here they come at you right now.
Pope actually found to be Jewish,
Liberace is Anastasia...

825
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:23,469
and Ethel Merman
jams Russian radar.

826
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:26,269
The East Germans today claimed that
the Berlin Wall was a fraternity prank.

827
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:29,849
Also, the Pope decided today to release
Vatican-related bath products,
an incredible thing.

828
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,650
Yes, it's the new Pope-on-a-Rope.
That's right. Pope-on-a-Rope.

829
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:35,750
Wash with it, go straight
to heaven. Thank you!

830
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,380
Ethel Merman today uses
a test to jam Russian radar.
Here's a briefest of that jamming.

831
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,840
Oh, I've got a feeling

832
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,780
That love is here to stay

833
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:49,110
When asked for a reply, the Russians
went, "What the hell was that?"

834
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,619
Here's a news flash.
Today President Lyndon Johnson
passed a highway beautification bill.

835
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,550
The bill basically said
that his daughters could not drive
in a convertible on public highways

836
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,260
Hey, we got a great show
comin' your way today.

837
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:04,929
Former Vice President Richard Nixon's
in town. That's right,
the big Dick is here. Get ready.

838
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,769
I think there's
an incredible coincidence here.
I think he sounds exactly like Mr Ed.

839
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:11,820
You be the judge.
"I tell you this."

840
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:15,170
Now listen: "Wilbur, come in the room."
An incredible coincidence.

841
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,869
Some more songs.
Movin' on, movin' on into the dawn
with the Dawnbusters. Yeah!

842
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,530
- Well, if you want me, it's all right
It's all right
- It's all right, it's all right

843
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:25,429
- It's all right
- It's all right

844
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:28,739
- Well, if you want me, it's all right
It's all right
- It's all right, it's all right

845
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,059
- It's all right
- It's all right

846
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,610
The requests will be taken
pretty soon. Requests--
Where am I gonna take requests?

847
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:37,760
Where do you call from? "Yeah, I'm in
a phone booth out in the DMZ.

848
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:42,570
- I'm trying to call you right now."
- And I think you're too fine

849
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,780
- You know, now, how I love ya
- Lock and loll, baby. Lock and loll.

850
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:49,389
Believe me
How I love ya, believe me

851
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:51,969
If you want me, it's all right

852
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,719
- If you want me, it's all right,
It's all right
- It's all right, it's all right

853
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,590
- It's all right
- It's all right

854
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:01,289
- Well, if you want me, it's all right
It's all right
- It's all right, it's all right
- Believe!

855
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:04,119
- It's all right
- It's all right

856
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,989
Once again we've got our friend
from military intelligence.

857
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,800
Can you tell us what you've found out
about the enemy since you've been here?

858
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,760
"We found out
that we can't find them.

859
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:17,199
They're out there, and we're having
a major difficulty...

860
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,880
in finding the enemy."

861
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,449
Well, what do you use
to look for them?

862
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:24,820
"Well, we ask people,
'Are you the enemy? '

863
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:27,659
And whoever says yes,
we shoot them."

864
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,570
- All right
- It's all right

865
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,949
- Well, if you want me, it's all right
It's all right
- It's all right

866
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,179
"It's very difficult to find
a Vietnamese man named Charlie.

867
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:39,719
They're all named Nyugen
or Doh or things like that.

868
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,250
- It's very difficult for me."
- Coming home, it feel nice

869
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:47,750
Thanks very much.
Is it true that you've actually, um--

870
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:50,650
You're actually too close to some
of the nerve agents they were testing?

871
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,090
"Nerve-- uh, gas?"

872
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,010
Yes, have you used any?

873
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,849
"Well, once, yes, on myself.

874
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:01,360
And it had no-- Whoa! Whoa!
No effect on me.

875
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:04,860
I've had no actual--
Whoa! She-hoo!

876
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,489
Whoa! Whoa! Big dogs!
Big dogs landing on my face!

877
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:10,849
I don't know what that means."

878
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:13,090
Hey, that's it for me.
I'm outta here.

879
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:16,329
That's the end of the Adrian Cron Hour,
but I'm gonna turn you over right now
to Mr Warmth.

880
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,969
Dan "The Tan" Levitan!

881
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,369
Thank you so much, Adrian.

882
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:25,590
Adrian Cronauer, GIs,
a wacky and welcome addition...

883
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:27,719
- to AFRS, Radio Saigon.
- Nixon's press conference.

884
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,489
Well, wait till you hear it.
He's this far from sincerity.

885
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,960
Uh, no, man, listen. Let me just feed
my face. Just a moment. Come on.

886
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:40,920
- Where do you imagine you're going?
- Just gonna get
a little somethin' to eat.

887
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,309
You don't have time. You'll stay here
and drink instant beverage or something.

888
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,460
We promised our listening audience
Nixon highlights by 4:OO p.m.

889
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,010
I've been on the air for four hours.
I'm a little hungry.

890
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:54,320
- That's a joke, right? I get it.
- No, I'm actually hungry.

891
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,849
Well, I'm actually
giving you an order.

892
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:04,889
Oh, it's an order.
In that case, gentlemen, let's edit.

893
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,829
Thank you.
Mm-mmm, Campbell's.

894
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:14,519
Aha! Ha! Earl!

895
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:17,099
Ha, you again.
No more fighting, okay?

896
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,110
Oh, you got it. James!
Nice, shiny green suit.

897
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,789
- You look like an Oriental leprechaun.
- You like it?

898
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,940
I got it in Hong Kong...

899
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:27,260
home of the shiny
green suit.

900
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,409
And therefore,
there is no place for neutrality...

901
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:33,400
or a neutralist sentiment
in South Vietnam.

902
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:37,329
As I leave Vietnam today, there
is no doubt, certainly, in my mind...

903
00:55:37,889 --> 00:55:40,980
- That's Nixon.
- but that the viet Cong
will be defeated...

904
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:43,940
and that this war
will be won.

905
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:47,539
Asia does involve, I think,
very appropriately as you have
suggested, give and take.

906
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,500
Well, I really didn't make that
suggestion, sir I'm sorry,

907
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:53,690
The United States
has no right to give.

908
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:57,260
- Why would Cronauer's voice
be on this tape?
- I don't know, Lieutenant.

909
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,659
...its territory
to the Communists,

910
00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:01,860
Mr Nixon, thank you for that
concise political commentary...

911
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:05,329
but I think I'd like to delve into
something slightly more personal
for the men in the field.

912
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:07,960
How would you describe
your testicles?

913
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:11,219
- That they're soft, that they're
shallow, that they have no purpose,
- Oh, my God.

914
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:15,199
- What are you saying, sir?
- Oh, my God.
- That they lack the physical strength.

915
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:19,539
- How would you describe
your sex life with your wife Pat?
- Uh, it is unexciting sometimes.

916
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,000
Well, have you considered possibly
a sex change? There is an operation
that can transform you...

917
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:26,420
- Please don't do this to me.
Please don't do this to me.
- into a female Great Dane
or possibly a very well-hung Chihuahua.

918
00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:31,019
Mr Nixon, while you've been in Vietnam,
it's rumoured that you smoked marijuana.

919
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,599
Are you planning, sir, to
take some of the mariruana home,
back to the United States?

920
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,619
- How would you do that?
- By plane...

921
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:39,909
by helicopter
and also by automobile.

922
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:42,780
I was wondering if you could do your
Mr Ed, because I know people love that.

923
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,980
Cut that thing off.
I said cut it off!

924
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:49,130
- Sir.
- Where is Cronauer?

925
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:52,639
- Still eating, sir.
- I want to see him ASAP.

926
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,340
- What, sir?
- As soon as possible.

927
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,050
- VG, sir.
- We interrupt this broadcast...

928
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:02,030
to bring you an emergency selection
of the Benny Goodman Orchestra.

929
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:05,099
We simply need to consider
taking him of off the air

930
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,250
Lieutenant, we get hundreds,
maybe thousands of calls
and letters each week, Fan mail

931
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:13,530
He's the first man in the history
of Armed Forces Radio to get fan mail.

932
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:17,150
Every GI in this country
is glued to his radio twice a day...

933
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,989
at O6:OO hours and 16:OO hours
to hear that lunatic.

934
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:24,309
Sir, the man has got
an irreverent tendency.

935
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:28,119
He did a very off-colour
parody of former VP Nixon.

936
00:57:28,289 --> 00:57:30,610
- I thought it was hilarious.
- Respectfully, sir...

937
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:34,150
the former V.P. is a good man
and a decent man.

938
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,159
Bullshit!
I know Nixon personally.

939
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:40,909
He lugs a trainload of shit behind him
that would fertilize the Sinai.

940
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,869
Why, I wouldn't buy an apple from
the son of a bitch, and I consider
him a good, close, personal friend.

941
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,849
Let's get down to business here,
General. What the hell's goin' on here?

942
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:51,269
We've got a mounting crisis
in this country. We've got
a deejay that the men dearly love.

943
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:54,829
If you two have personal problems,
solve them, will you?

944
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,510
Thank you, Lieutenant.

945
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:03,250
Thank you, Lieutenant!

946
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,320
Speak your piece, Dick.

947
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:15,050
Due respect, sir. I have over 15 years
command experience in this army.

948
00:58:15,809 --> 00:58:19,360
Do you really expect me to run
this radio station with nothin'
to say and no way to do it?

949
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,820
Right now, yes.

950
00:58:24,449 --> 00:58:26,659
Yes, sir.

951
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:31,340
This is not over yet.

952
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:35,500
If somebody wants you

953
00:58:35,969 --> 00:58:39,059
- Why are you still here?
- Sparky. Sittin' back, havin'
a cup of formaldehyde here.

954
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:41,860
You say after you go out with Trinh, you
meet me to talk and discuss about her.

955
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,650
- There's nothing to discuss.
She doesn't like me.
- Yes, she do.

956
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,929
- No, she don't.
- She do liking you.
She want to meet you today.

957
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:49,659
- She's not far from here.
- I can't. I gotta be back
on the air again at 4:OO.

958
00:58:49,889 --> 00:58:52,559
You have to meet her today.
Otherwise you miss your big chance.

959
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,639
- Don't want to miss my big chance.
- Yes. Come. We go.

960
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:58,269
- You sound like you learned English
from Tonto. "Come. We go."
- Come on.

961
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:00,179
Okay.

962
00:59:01,889 --> 00:59:04,630
- I still can't believe
she really wants to see me.
- Yeah.

963
00:59:04,769 --> 00:59:07,050
I guess that beach movie
really impressed her, huh?

964
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:10,909
I gotta get her something.
Uh, what about bananas?

965
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:13,519
- No.
- No, that doesn't say
the right thing. You're right.

966
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:15,500
How 'bout--

967
00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:29,980
Oh, my God!

968
01:00:11,969 --> 01:00:13,760
Oh, my God.

969
01:00:15,809 --> 01:00:18,440
Oh, my bar!
Why they do that?

970
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:28,880
Get back!

971
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:36,000
- You can't just leave 'em in
this shit here. Come on.
- This boy's gone.

972
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,159
Let's go. Come on.
Come on.

973
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:48,389
Get back.

974
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:57,619
...fire is worse, and the fire is
lapping the outside of the building.

975
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:11,179
Hey, where's he going?

976
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:18,480
What do you think you're doing?
You know you're forbidden to read
anything not checked by this office.

977
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:21,099
- What's there to check?
I was there. It happened.
- Airman, you know the rules.

978
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,340
If this is a legitimate news story,
it must go through proper channels.

979
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:26,429
Listen, Tweedle-dee,
it's an actual event. Where do you
think this came from, shaving?

980
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,920
It's the truth.
I just want to report the truth.
It'd be a nice change of pace.

981
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,920
- What's goin' on here?
- Sir, will you listen to me?

982
01:01:36,449 --> 01:01:38,380
This is not official news, Airman. As
far as I'm concerned, it didn't happen.

983
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:39,980
- It did happen and I was--
- You shut your mouth.

984
01:01:40,289 --> 01:01:42,079
What are you afraid of, Dickerson?
People might find out
there's a war goin' on?

985
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:44,340
This news
is not official, Airman.

986
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:47,210
You want everyone going under
the assumption it's perfectly
safe here, don't you? Well, it's not.

987
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:49,309
The fighting's not just in the hills.
It's downtown. It's a couple
of fuckin' blocks--

988
01:01:49,889 --> 01:01:52,519
I said it is none of
your goddam business!

989
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,719
I see your point.
I'm sorry.

990
01:01:59,489 --> 01:02:02,469
I guess I get inside, hit these
air conditioners, I get a little dizzy.

991
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:08,130
Thanks for settin' me straight.
I'll be okay.

992
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:13,610
That about wraps it up for me,
Marty Lee, filling in for my buddy...

993
01:02:14,369 --> 01:02:17,389
vacationing Eddie Kirk, who, despite all
your requests, will return tomorrow.

994
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,539
Right now, it's once again time
for the King Kong of Saigon...

995
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:22,699
Adrian Cronauer

996
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:34,440
Good morning, Vietnam!

997
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:36,900
Hey, I know it's not the morning,
but that's my trademark...

998
01:02:37,409 --> 01:02:39,199
and "good evening"
sounds too depressing,

999
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:41,360
Hey, we're goin'
right now to the news.

1000
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,940
From England, today,
Princess Margaret threw a shoe!

1001
01:02:48,449 --> 01:02:52,030
Easy, Madge. Also, uh, Elizab--
Queen Elizabeth, Liz-- Elizabeth Taylor!

1002
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,440
Elizabeth Taylor.
She's still married after six months.

1003
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:59,269
Way to go, Liz. Yea!

1004
01:02:59,969 --> 01:03:02,809
All right! In Saigon today,
according to official sources...

1005
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:04,940
nothing actually happened.

1006
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:08,409
One thing that didn't officially happen
was a bomb didn't officially explode
at 14:3O hours...

1007
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:10,500
unofficially destroying
Jimmy Wah's Cafe.

1008
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:14,170
- Get him out of there.
- Three men were unofficially
wounded, and two men...

1009
01:03:14,849 --> 01:03:17,690
- whose identities are still not known
at this time are unofficially dead
- It's locked!

1010
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:22,000
- Well, break the goddam door down!
-Although the police, ambulance
and fire department responded...

1011
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,809
what's believed to be unofficial
at this present moment.

1012
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:28,860
- Turn the power of in that studio.
- But his show is--
- Turn it off! Now!

1013
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:32,849
I just wanted
to think that you should--

1014
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,239
The man should be
court-martialed, sir.

1015
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:19,010
You think this is the most serious set
of affairs I have to address this week?

1016
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:21,130
- Well, it's not.
- I can't believe you're
gonna pass on this, General.

1017
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,559
- The man is a goddamned subversive.
- He made a mistake, Dick.

1018
01:04:23,929 --> 01:04:27,440
Mistake, sir? I don't want to be around
when he broadcasts US troop movements
to the other side.

1019
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,920
I run the station according to strict
guidelines set by military intelligence.

1020
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,519
Military intelligence?
There's a contradiction in terms.

1021
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,730
Sir, the man is
a walking keg of dynamite.

1022
01:04:35,929 --> 01:04:39,550
In the eight weeks he's been on
the air, General, he's disobeyed
orders as to style and content

1023
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:43,090
He's read unofficial news.
What's he gonna be like in six months?

1024
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,960
What's he gonna be like when
he's ten times as popular, General?

1025
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:50,809
- How easy is it gonna be
to get him off the air then?
- Who'll do the Cronauer show?

1026
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:54,309
Well, Hauk can do it, sir,
till I find a replacement.

1027
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:59,210
- Okay, for now, suspend him.
- Sir, you've made the correct choice.

1028
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:04,639
Right here, right here on our show,
Diana Ross and the "Suprawns."

1029
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:07,460
Set me free why don't you, babe

1030
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:10,159
Set me free
why don't you, babe

1031
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:14,210
You don't really need me
You just keep me steamin'on

1032
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:17,789
Thank you very much. Let me introduce
the members of the band. Larry, Pisces.

1033
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,340
Thank you very much.

1034
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,610
- What'd he say?
- He say you drink too much already.

1035
01:05:23,929 --> 01:05:26,280
Well, tell him I drink
so I can be this funny.

1036
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:32,300
It's not funny at all,
he said.

1037
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:34,739
Tell him thanks. It's nice
to bomb in another language.

1038
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:37,989
You will get sick
if you drink some more. Come on.

1039
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:43,570
My village not too far from here.
You could come there for resting.

1040
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,260
You could see
how we live.

1041
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:49,869
Listen, Sparky, I don't think
seeing your little production of
Our Town is gonna cheer me up

1042
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:53,139
- You see Trinh there.
- I'll drive.

1043
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,579
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red-- Led--

1044
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:58,519
- Red-- Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather--
- Sir, sir

1045
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:01,809
Reading the news is one thing,
but this stuff you wrote,
i'-it's not funny, sir It's sad

1046
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:05,630
Sir? I'm begging you, Don't try to
do comedy, It's not in your blood

1047
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,849
I'll do fine,
Comedy is what you make it,

1048
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,590
I've got pages and pages
of great material. Right, Abersold?

1049
01:06:11,929 --> 01:06:14,530
I'm afraid you're gonna
be hittin' bottom, sir.

1050
01:06:14,809 --> 01:06:17,369
If it isn't funny, then why did I
hear you laughing when you typed it?

1051
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:19,409
I was thinking
of something else,

1052
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:23,320
Thank you for your support.
Now I've got a show to do.

1053
01:06:23,929 --> 01:06:25,889
Sir, you're not funny,
Ask around

1054
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:28,059
Ask me. Sir,
with all due respect...

1055
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:30,659
uh, uh, I think you're gonna--
you might lay an egg-- I mean a big egg.

1056
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:33,800
I mean, I know funny, and I don't think
you're it, But hey, such is life.

1057
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:37,170
Me, I'm not much
with power tools.

1058
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:39,949
Hey, that was the great,
exciting sound of Petula Clark.

1059
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,949
- Beach Boys. Those were guys.
- Of the Beach Boys,

1060
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:45,059
Hey, that wraps it up for me,
Marty Lee Dreiwitz.

1061
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,210
Adrian Cronauer is on
temporary assignment...

1062
01:06:47,449 --> 01:06:49,619
but boy, do I have
a surprise for you.

1063
01:06:50,329 --> 01:06:53,000
- Don't build him up.
You'll only let 'em down.
- Please welcome to the microphone...

1064
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:57,320
the lieutenant of laughs, the officer
of oral, the Westmoreland of wit...

1065
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,260
swingin' Steven Hauh!

1066
01:07:02,329 --> 01:07:04,929
Hello, Vietnam,
And greetings,

1067
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:07,739
Soon, the news,
Then--

1068
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:10,760
"lieutenant Steve!
lieutenant Steve!"

1069
01:07:11,449 --> 01:07:14,150
Who's that?
"It's me,your old pal Frenchy, "

1070
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:17,210
Listen, Frenchy, let me ask you
something. Do you like good food?

1071
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:20,500
"Oh, but of course.
Uh, the French love good food."

1072
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:25,090
Well, then, I guess that would
make you an "Eatie Gourmet."

1073
01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:28,340
"Oh, ho, ho, ho, Lieutenant Steve."

1074
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:32,170
- Oh, Frenchy.
- "Oh, ho, ho, Lieutenant Steve."

1075
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,570
Frenchy. You know,
I really shouldn't kid Frenchy...

1076
01:07:37,369 --> 01:07:40,250
because sometimes he
"Stan Getz" mad at me...

1077
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,800
and he could "Al Hirt" me.

1078
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:45,519
"Uh, Lieutenant Steve,
Let's play some music."

1079
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,699
Okay, Frenchy.
What would you like to hear?

1080
01:07:48,409 --> 01:07:51,429
"Well, uh, I love a good polka
as much as the next man."

1081
01:07:51,769 --> 01:07:55,030
Well, a good polka it is
for my good friend Frenchy.

1082
01:08:03,769 --> 01:08:05,909
I think some apologies
are in order.

1083
01:08:15,769 --> 01:08:18,720
You're not gonna continue
this broadcast, are you, sir?

1084
01:08:58,489 --> 01:09:00,840
- What are they doing?
- Oh, they're Buddhists.

1085
01:09:01,369 --> 01:09:04,489
They're sitting
for peace, wisdom and knowledge.

1086
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:06,899
They're waiting
for enlightenment.

1087
01:09:23,449 --> 01:09:26,220
This man lose one son
from blasting American mine.

1088
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:31,130
His father and brother
was killed by French long ago.

1089
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:33,680
I think it's not fair to him.

1090
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:32,130
Look.

1091
01:10:32,569 --> 01:10:34,460
He's going,
"No big deal." Look.

1092
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:37,920
How lovin' can you feel
when you got that moment when

1093
01:10:38,329 --> 01:10:41,279
Don't you know that the time
can be that away, warka-wack
wacka-wack, wacka-wack

1094
01:10:41,689 --> 01:10:44,569
And don't you know that it ain't gonna
be and you feel that the time you see

1095
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:47,930
And it all wacka-wack
wacka-wacka, wacka-wacka
I know and I'm movin'

1096
01:10:48,409 --> 01:10:50,409
Look. Up there. Pull.

1097
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,840
Pull.

1098
01:11:11,449 --> 01:11:14,500
You not understand.
You not.

1099
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:17,579
We no future together, "Cronow."

1100
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:21,800
My country, maybe no future.

1101
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:27,300
Hey, I like you. I just want
to be your friend, okay?

1102
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:30,750
- I know it sounds dumb.
- I-- I not can do this, "Cronow."

1103
01:11:32,569 --> 01:11:34,890
No. No friend, "Cronow."

1104
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,710
Not good for, for me.

1105
01:11:39,289 --> 01:11:41,890
My brother,
okay, friends.

1106
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:45,329
But Vietnam ladies not friends.

1107
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,680
Please. Okay?

1108
01:11:51,289 --> 01:11:52,939
Not friends.

1109
01:12:03,289 --> 01:12:05,539
Great week.

1110
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:49,119
That's about as good a polka
as you'll ever hear.

1111
01:12:53,489 --> 01:12:55,630
You want Cronauer
back on the air.

1112
01:12:57,810 --> 01:13:01,109
We've gotten duffel bags
filled with information asking
for Cronauer's reinstatement.

1113
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:04,350
The men all hate Hauk.
They want Cronauer back.

1114
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:08,239
He's an exhilarating personality,
and polkas are just no substitute.

1115
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,869
- I think I see a pattern forming here.
- Sir, these letters are unequivocal.

1116
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:14,880
Uh, e.g. "Hey, Hauk, eat a bag
of shit. You suck."

1117
01:13:15,569 --> 01:13:18,060
That's pretty much to the point, sir.
Not much grey area in this one.

1118
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:22,170
We got one positive call from some guy
in Wichita who thought Hauk's comedy
was visionary and interesting.

1119
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:26,630
The other 1,1OO calls said that the man
can't do comedy to save his dick.

1120
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:30,779
- That's a direct quote, sir.
- I've taken 9O calls this morning.
They just don't like Hauk.

1121
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:35,939
From a marine in Da Nang: "Captain Hauk
sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls."

1122
01:13:36,689 --> 01:13:40,060
I have no idea what that means, sir,
but it seems very negative to me.

1123
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:42,600
I think the troops are tryin'
to tell us somethin', fellas.

1124
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:46,560
Sir, if it is my programming
choices, I can change.

1125
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:50,130
I've been broadcasting
the polkas because I thought
a certain segment of the men...

1126
01:13:50,609 --> 01:13:53,489
weren't represented by Cronauer's
broadcasts of rock and roll.

1127
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,430
But I can easily play
an occasional Gay Lewis record.

1128
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:00,569
It doesn't make a damn whether
you play polkas or don't play polkas.
Military politics.

1129
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,420
Nothing personal. The men just
like him better than they do you.

1130
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:06,939
He maliciously and with purposeful
intent read unofficial news.

1131
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:09,920
No, no, no, no.
He made a mistake.

1132
01:14:10,289 --> 01:14:14,569
We all make mistakes. Now this thing
is a delicate balance over here...

1133
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:17,229
and I don't want it
dependent on a disc jockey.

1134
01:14:17,489 --> 01:14:19,140
The men want him back,
I want him back.

1135
01:14:19,409 --> 01:14:24,189
Sir, you heard from the men
who don't like my humour, but what
about the silent masses who do?.

1136
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:28,649
And as far as polkas, they are
a much-maligned musical taste.

1137
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:33,260
Lieutenant, you don't know whether
you're shot, fucked, powder-burned or
snake-bit. I don't care about polkas.

1138
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:37,180
They're rioting in Hue. We're bringin'
in thousands of troops every month.

1139
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:40,060
Terrorism's on the uprise
in Saigon.

1140
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:42,609
The problems of this country have not
one goddamned thing to do with...

1141
01:14:43,409 --> 01:14:45,409
whether you play polkas
or don't play polkas.

1142
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:48,409
The men want him back.
I want him back.

1143
01:14:48,689 --> 01:14:50,439
Reinstate the man.

1144
01:14:51,569 --> 01:14:53,430
Sir, in my heart...

1145
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:55,720
I know I'm funny.

1146
01:14:56,850 --> 01:14:58,710
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1147
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:10,420
- There you are, sir.
- Please don't call me "sir."

1148
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:12,909
It just came down the pike.
You're back on the air, sir.

1149
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:16,329
- I'm not goin' on.
- What do you mean
you're not goin' on?

1150
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:20,770
If you don't understand what I said,
maybe you should take my English class.
I'm not goin' on.

1151
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:23,720
You're a very attractive man, Abersold.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1152
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:29,039
- You'll be bored, you know.
What are you gonna do with your time?
- I don't know.

1153
01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:32,789
I may go downtown, look
for a Vietnamese man named Phil.

1154
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:35,819
Or I may just stay here
and listen to old Pat Boone records.

1155
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:40,460
Try and find some hidden meaning
'cause basically I believe that
that man is a misunderstood genius.

1156
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,529
Genius. What are you
saying to me?

1157
01:15:45,329 --> 01:15:48,520
I'm sayin' I'm through, Ed. I'm tired
of people tellin' me what I can't say.

1158
01:15:48,689 --> 01:15:51,430
This news isn't official.
That comment is too sarcastic.

1159
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:55,560
I can't even make fun of
Richard Nixon, and there's a man
who's screaming out to be made fun of.

1160
01:15:56,369 --> 01:15:58,930
So fuck it. Sorry.

1161
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,720
- Is he all right?
- No, Phil, he's not all right.

1162
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:06,600
A man does not refer to Pat Boone
as a beautiful genius
if things are all right.

1163
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,920
- Sir.
- Garlick?

1164
01:16:14,609 --> 01:16:17,770
I'd like you to collate these
one-minute spots prior to broadcast.

1165
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:20,989
You have a problem
with that, young man?

1166
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:24,550
Absolutely not.
I live to collate, sir.

1167
01:16:24,689 --> 01:16:28,170
Good. So do I.

1168
01:16:31,409 --> 01:16:35,270
- "Get A Job."
- Get a job. Again.

1169
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:39,439
- Get a job. Right. You got it.
You're cookin' now.
- Sir?

1170
01:16:39,569 --> 01:16:42,479
- Edward.
- I'd like an explanation.

1171
01:16:43,409 --> 01:16:46,819
- On anything in particular?
- A lot of people
went to the mat for you.

1172
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:51,710
Thousands of guys wrote in, called in,
tryin' to get you reinstated.

1173
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:56,569
And I literally think
that you owe it to all of them
to get your ass back on the air.

1174
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:59,239
If you haven't noticed,
the army doesn't really want me, Ed.

1175
01:16:59,729 --> 01:17:01,659
They've been harassing me since
the day I got of the plane.

1176
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:06,869
So what? It's the guys
in the field that matter, remember?
Those are the guys that are dyin'.

1177
01:17:07,409 --> 01:17:10,359
Edward, I tried to tell the truth,
and they kicked me of the air.

1178
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:13,720
I screw up once more,
Dickerson sends me into the field
with a rifle. I come home in a box.

1179
01:17:14,609 --> 01:17:16,640
What you do is important
to a lot of people.

1180
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:19,569
Forget it, will ya?
Listen. I give up.

1181
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:23,079
I'm gonna phone 'em in, okay?
Enough bullshit.
I'm outta here. See you, fellas.

1182
01:17:23,729 --> 01:17:25,869
- Buy you some lunch.
- Can't let you do that.

1183
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:29,220
Listen, if I don't get to my class,
there's gonna be a bunch of Vietnamese
speaking in short choppy sentences.

1184
01:17:29,489 --> 01:17:32,329
- Look, we gotta talk.
We gotta talk now.
- Not now, man. Come on.

1185
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:36,149
I can't believe you!
What? That's it?

1186
01:17:36,689 --> 01:17:39,149
You're gonna leave the whole fuckin'
thing behind. You're gonna leave
everything fuckin' hanging.

1187
01:17:39,569 --> 01:17:43,079
- People are depending on you!
- Edward, please.

1188
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:45,890
That's two nasty words
in one year.

1189
01:17:46,289 --> 01:17:48,569
- Forgive me.
- Hey.

1190
01:17:48,689 --> 01:17:51,460
Hey, you wanna give me a ride to school
or am I gonna have to buy another bike?

1191
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,840
You're pissin' me off.

1192
01:18:04,529 --> 01:18:06,949
- What the hell's the hold-up?
- Check it out.

1193
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:15,970
Garlick, will you cut it out?
You're beginning to sound like
a priest in a '4Os movie.

1194
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:18,920
We are not firing you
when the boys are dependin' on you.

1195
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:29,689
- Gentlemen?
- What are you doing, Ed?

1196
01:18:30,449 --> 01:18:32,729
Hey, guys. Guess who the hell
I got in here.

1197
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:35,020
- Uh-oh. Don't do this shit.
- Groucho Marx!

1198
01:18:35,729 --> 01:18:37,380
- Senator Dirksen.
- Hey, Curly!

1199
01:18:37,649 --> 01:18:40,529
-Moe.
-Come on, come on, come on. Guess again.
-Oh, bag it. Bag it, Garlick.

1200
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:45,720
The fellow I got in here is
the gentleman, the one and the only...

1201
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:49,729
- You're a dead man.
- king of the airwaves, Adrian Cronauer.

1202
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:52,729
Hey, Peterson, get up here, man.
I think we got Cronauer here.

1203
01:18:53,489 --> 01:18:56,970
Hey, Cronauer, say
"Good morning, Vietnam."

1204
01:18:57,329 --> 01:18:59,609
Oh, give me a break, man.
It's too hot for radio shit, okay?

1205
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:01,960
- Come on.
- Come on!

1206
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,899
- How do we know it's Adrian Cronauer?
- Okay.

1207
01:19:05,489 --> 01:19:07,279
I'll give her the best shot.

1208
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:11,029
Good morning, Vietnam!

1209
01:19:14,609 --> 01:19:16,680
All right! All right!

1210
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:21,880
We love you, Cron!

1211
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:24,680
All right, this is Adrian Cronauer.
I'm on at 6:OO and again at 4:OO.

1212
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:27,449
Hey, we'd like to welcome you
to Vietnam, the country
that is more stimulating...

1213
01:19:27,569 --> 01:19:29,920
than a strong cup of cappuccino
or an espresso enema.

1214
01:19:30,449 --> 01:19:34,170
That one's comin' right at you
right now, but first,
our fashion report from Special Forces
Sergeant Ernest Lee Sincere.

1215
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:38,350
"Thank you. I think this fall,
the discerning GI is gonna
be wearing green in the jungle.

1216
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:41,090
Why? Because it matches
with the green. I don't know.

1217
01:19:41,489 --> 01:19:44,369
The leaves, they fall upon the helmets,
says yes to me." Thank you.

1218
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:47,409
Here's a little news flash
comin' yourway right now.

1219
01:19:47,729 --> 01:19:51,520
We can't afford the teletype.
Here it is, comin' for you
right now. Quick news flash.

1220
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:54,079
Former President Eisenhower,
actually cartoon character Elmer Fudd.

1221
01:19:54,449 --> 01:19:56,520
He was quoted as saying:
"Thank you, America.

1222
01:19:56,850 --> 01:19:58,739
It was fun being President."

1223
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,670
Also, Gina Lollobrigida has been
declared the Italian National
Mountain Range.

1224
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,590
Thank you, Gina. "Look out.
Look, I don't see the sun any more."

1225
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:08,840
Let's play a little game show while
we're waiting. And who can tell me
who sang the song "My Guy"?

1226
01:20:09,329 --> 01:20:11,010
- Hi. Where you from?
- Uh, Boston.

1227
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:14,130
- Boston, you know who
sang the song "My Guy"?
- Yeah, shit, I can't think of it.

1228
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:17,449
Thank you for playing! "Yeah, shit,
I can't think of it." That's right.

1229
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:21,449
You don't win the case of
fish balls and lizard testicles.
Thank you for playing anyway.

1230
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:24,720
- Here it is right now.
Hey, what's your name?
- Patrick O'Ma-- O'Malley.

1231
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:29,560
Patrick O-O-O-O'Malley. I don't know.
I'm just so happy. I'm O-O-O'Malley.

1232
01:20:30,449 --> 01:20:32,869
Oh, he's good.
I don't know. It's the Irish boy.

1233
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:36,000
I'm just so full of semen.
I haven't gotten laid yet.

1234
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:38,979
I'm sittin' out there,
and I'm the Catholic boy and I don't
know when I'll be gettin' laid.

1235
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:42,619
- I'm just goin' of to Vietnam.
Where you from?
- From the Village. New York.

1236
01:20:43,409 --> 01:20:46,289
From the Village? Well, nice to have you
here. Nice to have you here in Vietnam.

1237
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:49,720
Obviously, you just said,
"Well, fuck it. I'll join the army
and be with people in green."

1238
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:52,270
- It's a special thing to do.
Hey, what's your name?
- Jimmy Wilkes.

1239
01:20:52,529 --> 01:20:54,460
- Jimmy Wilkes. Where you from, Jimmy?
- I'm also New York.

1240
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,539
Ohh! Two boys
joined together.

1241
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:59,100
Hey, said, "Well, I got drunk, man.
All of a sudden, I went for a tattoo.

1242
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,279
Next thing you know, I'm on
a fuckin' truck. What happened?"

1243
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:04,039
It's wild, baby.
I don't know what's goin' down.
But you're both from New York.

1244
01:21:04,529 --> 01:21:06,279
Nice to have you here.
Like, you just, like hangin' out?

1245
01:21:06,449 --> 01:21:08,409
- You're headed north.
Where you goin' to?
- Nha Trengh.

1246
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,529
Well, you gotta be careful,Jack.
That's some heavy stuff up there.

1247
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:12,979
That's like Newark after dark.
You gotta watch out.

1248
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:15,539
There's some heavy shit
goin' down, baby.

1249
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:18,260
You'll feel like George Wallace
campaigning in Harlem.
"Hi, have you seen my face?"

1250
01:21:18,449 --> 01:21:21,189
"Get yo' ass outta here!"
You gotta watch it.
What type of music do you like?

1251
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,979
- You like, uh-- You like Little
Anthony? You like Little Anthony?
- Yeah! Stones.

1252
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:26,489
- I like James Brown better.
- You like James Brown better. Yes, sir.

1253
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:29,020
And the Stones. Oh, you like
Mick Jagger? Mick Jagger, right.

1254
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,850
Do you think he looks like
a photo negative of Little Richard
or am I crazy?

1255
01:21:32,369 --> 01:21:34,859
Really. And that hair. I think--
I don't know. All right!

1256
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,140
Gentlemen, I don't know--
Oh, my God, these lips!

1257
01:21:37,649 --> 01:21:39,970
My God, they're moving!
I'm gonna flap my eyebrows to death.

1258
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:43,550
Look out. I'm singing, everybody.
I'm singing. Oh, get outta here.

1259
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:47,119
- Watch out. All right.
Where are you from? Where you from?
- I'm from, uh, Cleveland, man.

1260
01:21:47,729 --> 01:21:49,979
- Cleveland.
- Yeah.
- Obviously, Vietnam's not that much
of a change for you, then.

1261
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:52,449
Aw, nah.

1262
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:57,399
You guys take care of yourself, 'cause
you all look like: I don't know what's
gonna happen, man. I don't know.

1263
01:21:58,289 --> 01:22:00,920
- What's this thing on the side of
Your helmet? What is that thing
You're wearing? What do you got there?
- Here. Why don't you try it out?

1264
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:04,189
Well, "Why don't you try it out?"
Look at this. Look at that. It says
here, it says what size you got.

1265
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:06,880
You got large, medium
and Caucasian.

1266
01:22:07,409 --> 01:22:11,340
Look at this thing. A little
Italian party favour there. Oh!
"Oh, no, Bozo, boys and girls."

1267
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:14,140
Look at this thing. Obviously, this
is goin' like, "Yeah, check it out."

1268
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:16,590
Hold on. Look. How big is this thing?
Hold on. How big is this?

1269
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:20,029
Black man's goin', "It's just for
the tip. That's all I need is the tip."

1270
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:23,270
It's a bathing cap.
I just like to put a bathing cap.

1271
01:22:23,729 --> 01:22:27,420
Remember, this is the Vietnamese word
"Con Dum." Look. Italian moon launch.

1272
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:30,550
There. Whoa, jeez.
It almost blew up in my face.

1273
01:22:31,409 --> 01:22:33,899
There's prophylactic everywhere, man.
It's not a pretty picture.

1274
01:22:34,289 --> 01:22:36,109
There's pieces of rubber
all over his face.

1275
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:38,699
I don't know what to say.
You guys, be careful. What's your name?

1276
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,760
- My name is Lewis Striker.
- Lewis Striker, Brother Striker.
Thank you, Brother Striker.

1277
01:22:42,449 --> 01:22:44,239
- Sean Donum.
- Sean Donum.
- Jay Snyder.

1278
01:22:44,369 --> 01:22:47,109
Feels like the Mouseketeers show.
Annette, Cubby, Roy!

1279
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:51,029
Well, you guys, you take care
of yourselves. I won't forget you.

1280
01:22:51,569 --> 01:22:55,359
All right, guys, let's say goodbye
to the radio star. We're outta here.

1281
01:22:59,729 --> 01:23:02,640
Bye-bye-bye-bye!

1282
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:21,989
All right!

1283
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:17,159
Good morning, Vietnam!

1284
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,880
Hey, it's another delightful day
here in Vacationland

1285
01:24:21,329 --> 01:24:22,979
Everybody, time to get up,

1286
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,140
Get up, wherever you are,

1287
01:24:25,649 --> 01:24:28,949
That's right, rise and shine,
rise and shine!

1288
01:24:29,409 --> 01:24:32,250
Got some songs goin' out
right now to a couple of guys
on the road to Nha Trengh.

1289
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:35,409
You know what I'm talkin' about.
Hey, Mr O'Malley, O'Malley.

1290
01:24:35,729 --> 01:24:37,550
You know.
The Irish Dolby twins.

1291
01:24:37,649 --> 01:24:40,699
They're out there. Special song
goin' out to you, right now.

1292
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:48,409
I see trees of green

1293
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:53,010
red roses too

1294
01:24:53,489 --> 01:24:56,260
I see them bloom

1295
01:24:56,369 --> 01:24:58,329
For me and you

1296
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:01,510
And I think to myself

1297
01:25:03,569 --> 01:25:06,310
what a wonderful world

1298
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:13,920
I see skies of blue

1299
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:18,100
and clouds of white

1300
01:25:18,449 --> 01:25:21,470
The bright blessed day

1301
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:24,270
the dark sacred night

1302
01:25:24,689 --> 01:25:27,220
And I think to myself

1303
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:31,710
what a wonderful world

1304
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:39,800
The colours of the rainbow

1305
01:25:40,529 --> 01:25:43,369
so pretty in the sky

1306
01:25:43,890 --> 01:25:46,939
Are also on the faces

1307
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:49,000
Of people going by

1308
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:52,539
I see friends shakin' hands

1309
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:56,380
sayin'
"How do you do?"

1310
01:25:57,329 --> 01:26:01,899
They're really saying
"I love you"

1311
01:26:02,609 --> 01:26:06,050
I hear babies cryin'

1312
01:26:06,449 --> 01:26:09,260
I watch them grow

1313
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:12,340
They'll learn much more

1314
01:26:12,689 --> 01:26:15,289
than I'll ever know

1315
01:26:15,569 --> 01:26:17,989
And I think to myself

1316
01:26:20,369 --> 01:26:22,399
what a wonderful world

1317
01:26:26,609 --> 01:26:30,680
Yes, I think to myself,

1318
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:36,789
what a wonderful world

1319
01:26:43,409 --> 01:26:46,250
- Oh,yeah
- Oh,yeah

1320
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:51,020
That was Louis B. Armstrong,
the great Satchmo.

1321
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:59,140
Want to interview some GIs
in the field, sir? And play
those tapes on the radio?

1322
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:01,819
God only knows
what they'd say, sir.

1323
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,930
It involves Cronauer, which
makes me suspicious immediately.

1324
01:27:05,489 --> 01:27:09,699
An Lac. And Cronauer would definitely
be going along? Hold on a minute, sir.

1325
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:17,090
G-2, Corporal Tiser, sir.

1326
01:27:18,449 --> 01:27:20,060
One moment.

1327
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:28,520
- Route One-A, sir,
is the only route to An Lac, sir.
- Does that road have a secure status?

1328
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:31,819
No, sir, it does not.
That road is Victor Charlie, sir.

1329
01:27:32,369 --> 01:27:35,529
- It is definitely not a friendly area.
- Negative, sir. It is not.

1330
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:39,229
It is hazardous and, uh,
has been for about 48 hours.

1331
01:27:39,569 --> 01:27:42,310
Heavily fortified and considered
very unsafe, sir.

1332
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,819
Thank you.

1333
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:51,310
Sir, I recommend we issue
a 24-hour pass.

1334
01:28:08,369 --> 01:28:11,210
So this is the country where
they grow rattan love seats.

1335
01:28:11,729 --> 01:28:14,359
God, is it hot.
What a country.

1336
01:28:14,609 --> 01:28:18,609
Heat, humidity, terrorism. Still,
it's better than New York in the summer.

1337
01:28:19,409 --> 01:28:21,899
Hey, fellas,
how's the cough drop business?

1338
01:28:30,449 --> 01:28:33,050
You know, we haven't passed
too many checkpoints since Chon Thanh.

1339
01:28:33,329 --> 01:28:36,350
Why do you make every Vietnamese town
sound like a Mexican restaurant?

1340
01:28:36,689 --> 01:28:38,760
Britain imposed an oil embargo
on Rhodesia today...

1341
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:41,579
after that country's unilateral
declaration of independence.

1342
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:45,939
Gambia, Singapore and the Maldive
Islands join the United Nations.

1343
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:49,090
Sertse Khama becomes
the first premier of Bechuanaland.

1344
01:28:49,649 --> 01:28:52,109
In sports, all-star rookie
Pete Rose's three hits--

1345
01:28:52,529 --> 01:28:54,989
What do you think
you'll do after all this, Ed?
When you get out of the army?

1346
01:28:55,409 --> 01:28:57,020
I think I learned enough
about radio stations--

1347
01:28:57,329 --> 01:28:59,649
I mean, maybe I can work
in a station back home or something.

1348
01:28:59,729 --> 01:29:01,619
Really? Give me your best shot.
Lay somethin' on me.

1349
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,880
Give it a go.
Give it a go.

1350
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:06,789
This is Eddie Garlick comin' to you live
from AFRS, Armed Forces Radio Saigon.

1351
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:11,409
Now funkify it. Give me some real funk.
Give it to me, Edward.

1352
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:14,100
This is Eddie Garlick, com--

1353
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:16,760
Good morning, Vietnam!

1354
01:29:27,569 --> 01:29:31,819
You're listening to Eddie Kirk
on AFRS. I have a big special--

1355
01:29:56,369 --> 01:29:58,229
...for, but we need
to hear your requests,

1356
01:29:58,289 --> 01:30:00,819
So send in your postcards
to Eddie Kirk, right here.

1357
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:04,699
Hey!

1358
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:12,710
You fine. How you are?
Take you home.

1359
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:17,409
You come out.
No problem.

1360
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:21,270
Take you home.
Safe now from VC.

1361
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:37,229
Hi. This is Marty Lee Dreiwitz
at Cronauer Control Centre.

1362
01:30:37,649 --> 01:30:39,720
Adrian Cronauer is on
temporary assignment...

1363
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:42,930
and I'll be filling in until he arrives,
hopefully sometime this morning.

1364
01:30:43,409 --> 01:30:46,600
Right now, let's play a song
from Adrian's own playlist,
one of AC's favourites.

1365
01:30:57,329 --> 01:31:01,649
It's going to be an exciting day
of listening and learning,
so please, tune in.

1366
01:31:03,569 --> 01:31:07,149
"Sukiyaki," "Volare,"
"The Portuguese Washerwoman"...

1367
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:12,739
- and "Third Man Theme"
on the Kirk International--
- Baby, please don't go

1368
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:15,630
Baby, please don't go

1369
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:17,939
Baby, please don't go
down to New Orleans

1370
01:31:18,449 --> 01:31:20,939
You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go

1371
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:26,960
- Baby, I'm done gone
Baby, I'm done gone
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1372
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:34,930
- What's up?
- I try to find "Cronow."
He don't show up in class.

1373
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:39,079
He didn't show up for work today
either. You know anything about this?

1374
01:31:39,569 --> 01:31:40,800
Listen, jerkoff!

1375
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:43,960
We're here fighting for your country!
Now where did Cronauer go?

1376
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:46,600
An Lac. His pass say "An Lac."

1377
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:49,399
An Lac? Shit!

1378
01:32:01,689 --> 01:32:04,880
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. You okay?

1379
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:06,739
No.

1380
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:10,859
Come on, pal.
We'll make it.

1381
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:12,359
- I have a hunch.
- Yeah.

1382
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:14,810
Baby, please don't go

1383
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:18,369
- VC. The fuckin' VC.
- Tell me somethin' I don't know, okay?

1384
01:32:21,449 --> 01:32:23,479
On that midnight train

1385
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:33,619
Baby, please don't go

1386
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:38,069
- How far you think we've gone?
- Ten, fifteen miles.

1387
01:32:38,729 --> 01:32:41,010
Think we've reached Cambodia yet?

1388
01:32:41,609 --> 01:32:44,350
How can you fight a war
in this shit?

1389
01:32:44,489 --> 01:32:46,489
I don't know where they are.
I don't even know where I am.

1390
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:50,149
Can't see dick.
Like hunting with Ray Charles.

1391
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:58,060
It okay! You can come out now.

1392
01:32:58,409 --> 01:33:01,640
If you here, I cannot find you
unless you talk to me.

1393
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:03,859
It's too dangerous
staying here.

1394
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:08,520
You don't believe it's me?
Okay. Flip them the bird!

1395
01:33:10,409 --> 01:33:13,390
- Tuan?
- Hey, there you are, "Cronow."

1396
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:15,560
How the hell'd you
find us, Sparky?

1397
01:33:16,170 --> 01:33:18,979
Your Jeep.

1398
01:33:19,529 --> 01:33:22,270
We're obviously not in Cambodia.

1399
01:33:25,289 --> 01:33:27,220
Try it again.

1400
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:31,520
One more time.

1401
01:33:34,409 --> 01:33:37,850
God damn it. Our Jeep gets blown off
the road, and his van won't start.

1402
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:41,800
- That's great. You know why
we ended up in the same place?
- Why is that?

1403
01:33:42,569 --> 01:33:44,640
Your limp pulled us to the right.
We were going around in circles.

1404
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:47,390
Stick with me. I don't want
to go around again.

1405
01:33:49,569 --> 01:33:51,500
We're not in Kansas
any more, Toto.

1406
01:33:57,930 --> 01:33:59,649
Listen.

1407
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:08,869
Somewhere over there.

1408
01:34:11,369 --> 01:34:13,439
There it is, man. Yo!

1409
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:18,420
Yo! Right there!

1410
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:21,130
Yo, GI!
Hello, sailor! Hello!

1411
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:24,890
Boogaloo, boogaloo! Hey!

1412
01:35:00,119 --> 01:35:04,539
To avoid razor burn problems,
always rinse your razor
with cold water instead of hot.

1413
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,670
Your skin will look and feel
a whole lot better.

1414
01:35:08,359 --> 01:35:10,569
That's it for "Hygiene in the Heat."
Tomorrow we'll--

1415
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:13,529
- Welcome back.
- Thank you, Sergeant. I've missed you.

1416
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,670
I'm informing you that you're
outta here. I want your bags packed
and ready to go tomorrow afternoon.

1417
01:35:22,279 --> 01:35:25,760
- You don't have the power.
I'll take this right to the authorities.
- I am the authorities, you moron!

1418
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:34,380
Oh, I got your pansy ass
in a sling now, Cronauer. Who's Tuan?

1419
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:38,609
The guys who flew you in from An Lac
radioed they'd picked up a young South
Vietnamese boy with you and Garlick.

1420
01:35:39,079 --> 01:35:42,800
- Who is this South Vietnamese boy?
- He's a friend from my class
who risked his ass to save my life.

1421
01:35:43,399 --> 01:35:46,770
A friend?
Your friend is a VC terrorist.

1422
01:35:47,239 --> 01:35:48,890
Yeah, and my mother's
a werewolf, right? Yeah.

1423
01:35:49,159 --> 01:35:51,159
Tuan is also known as
Phan Duc Tho.

1424
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,350
He's currently wanted by the
South Vietnamese police in connection
with several bombings in th area...

1425
01:35:56,359 --> 01:35:58,750
including the one
at Jimmy Wah's.

1426
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:01,529
Surely you're familiar
with that incident.

1427
01:36:02,119 --> 01:36:06,899
Did you ever wonder how
a young South Vietnamese boy gets
into and out of VC-held territory.

1428
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:11,069
It's dangerous out there.
Things just jump out at you.

1429
01:36:11,239 --> 01:36:13,979
And yet this boy can get in
and out without a scratch.

1430
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,229
And what about Jimmy Wah's? Didn't you
ever wonder why you were pulled out...

1431
01:36:17,479 --> 01:36:19,899
just moments before
the whole place blew up?

1432
01:36:20,359 --> 01:36:22,890
Or are you normally
not that inquisitive?

1433
01:36:26,119 --> 01:36:28,220
Friends of Phan Duc Tho.

1434
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:32,170
These three were executed shortly
after this photo was taken.

1435
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,329
Your friend is next.

1436
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,890
I don't recommend that you tangle
with me on this one, Airman.

1437
01:36:43,399 --> 01:36:47,680
There's not too many high-ranking
officers would be sympathetic to
a serviceman with links to terrorists.

1438
01:36:48,199 --> 01:36:50,689
The army is kind of
quirky that way.

1439
01:36:51,079 --> 01:36:53,989
A conviction on the charge of treason
against the United States carries
with it some penalties...

1440
01:36:54,439 --> 01:36:57,109
kind of on the stiff side,
if you know what I mean.

1441
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,800
I have arranged for
an honourable discharge, provided
you leave without incident.

1442
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:04,369
- Ten hut.
- At ease.

1443
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:11,859
Cronauer, I'm sorry as hell about
this thing. God damn it, I like you, son.

1444
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:16,369
I like what you do. Most of all,
I like what you've done for the men.

1445
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,630
But facts are facts.

1446
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:23,989
This could give the army
a black eye. I'm not gonna
cover for you this time, son.

1447
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:27,000
Sir? What about the show?

1448
01:37:29,479 --> 01:37:31,340
We'll handle it.

1449
01:37:31,399 --> 01:37:33,819
I'm sorry, son.

1450
01:37:38,119 --> 01:37:41,239
Why'd you do this?

1451
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:45,329
I don't like your style,
your politics or your sense of humour.

1452
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:48,050
I don't like what you say
or how you say it.

1453
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:51,729
From now on, the fighting men
of Vietnam will hear exactly
what they're supposed to hear.

1454
01:37:52,039 --> 01:37:55,520
You're on a DC-8 from Tan Son Nhut
airport tomorrow at 18i:3O hours.

1455
01:37:56,359 --> 01:37:58,710
I recommend
you pack quietly.

1456
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:01,109
That's all I have
for you, Airman.

1457
01:38:12,199 --> 01:38:13,710
You know...

1458
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:16,829
you're in more dire need of a blow job
than any white man in history.

1459
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:26,689
Whoa, there, Dick. Put the brakes on.
I wanted to wait till the airman
left to talk with you.

1460
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,260
Uh, Dick,
I'm transferring you.

1461
01:38:30,439 --> 01:38:32,399
- Transferring me, sir?
- Mm-hmm.

1462
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:35,609
- Where to, sir?
- You're going to Guam.

1463
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:38,829
Guam, sir! There's nothin' goin'
on in Guam! Why Guam?

1464
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:42,380
Dick, I've covered for you
a lot of times 'cause I thought
you was a little crazy.

1465
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:46,819
But you're not crazy. You're mean.
And this is just radio.

1466
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:01,260
"More dire need of a blow job than
any white man in history." That's funny.

1467
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:14,699
Hey, Teacher! When are you gonna
teach us the softball?

1468
01:39:15,079 --> 01:39:17,359
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Now! Come on.

1469
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,710
- Mr Cronauer, I must talk to you.
- Oh, Minh, not now.

1470
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,630
- Listen, you gotta tell me
where your brother is.
- Don't know.

1471
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:24,890
Listen, his life is in danger.
You gotta tell me where the hell he is.

1472
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:27,390
- No, I don't--
- Bullshit!

1473
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:31,489
Listen. No more games, okay?
The army knows about your brother.

1474
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:34,890
I have to leave the country
because of my association with him.

1475
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:38,399
They have pictures of him.
If they find him, they will shoot him.

1476
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:41,649
If you want to continue to have
a brother, you take me to him now!

1477
01:40:51,079 --> 01:40:53,010
Phan Duc Tho!

1478
01:40:57,319 --> 01:40:59,810
Get back here!

1479
01:41:57,319 --> 01:41:59,000
Know about
the bombings, Sparky.

1480
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:03,029
No wonder you hauled ass.

1481
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,449
You were my friend.

1482
01:42:14,119 --> 01:42:15,770
I trusted you.

1483
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:21,680
You hear me?

1484
01:42:22,279 --> 01:42:25,510
You naive man, "Cronow."
You take a stupid side.

1485
01:42:26,119 --> 01:42:28,609
Now you have to go.
It's better off.

1486
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,100
That's not the fucking point!

1487
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:34,800
Understand me?

1488
01:42:35,239 --> 01:42:39,420
I fought to get you into that bar,
and then you blow the fuckin' place up.

1489
01:42:41,479 --> 01:42:46,289
Listen. I gave you
my friendship and my trust...

1490
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,850
and now they tell me that
my best friend is the goddam enemy!

1491
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:52,699
Enemy? What is enemy?

1492
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,590
You killing my own people
so many miles from your home.

1493
01:42:57,319 --> 01:43:00,270
We not the enemy.
You the enemy!

1494
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:04,159
You used me to kill two people.
Two people died in that fuckin' bar.

1495
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,840
Big fucking deal!

1496
01:43:07,399 --> 01:43:09,539
My mother is dead.

1497
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:13,520
And my older brother,
who be 29 years old, he dead.

1498
01:43:14,119 --> 01:43:15,729
Shot by Americans.

1499
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,159
My neighbour, dead.
His wife, dead.

1500
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:22,770
Why?

1501
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:25,340
Because we're not
human to them.

1502
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:27,529
We're only little Vietnamese.

1503
01:43:31,399 --> 01:43:34,140
And I'm stupid enough to save
your bullshit life at An Lac.

1504
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,569
Wait.

1505
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:47,529
We're here to help this country.
Where the fuck you goin'?

1506
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,869
It's unbelievable.

1507
01:43:59,239 --> 01:44:01,409
Five months in Saigon...

1508
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:04,729
and my best friend
turns out to be a VC.

1509
01:44:05,479 --> 01:44:08,220
This will not look good
on a résumé!

1510
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,739
- You guys mind if I drive?
- Be my guest.

1511
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:43,520
It's a simple rule. If the engine's
humming, it's already started.

1512
01:44:44,119 --> 01:44:47,449
Never fails. You guys mind
if we make a little unscheduled stop?
I got something I gotta do.

1513
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:51,819
If you attempt to deviate
from the afore planned schedule,
you're under arrest, Cronauer.

1514
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,329
Okay, everybody, let's play ball!

1515
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:57,710
Go into conference.
That point. That fence.

1516
01:44:58,039 --> 01:45:00,250
- Okay, here we go.
- Go, batter. Go, batter.

1517
01:45:01,399 --> 01:45:03,289
Whoa! Headin' north!

1518
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,119
Let's go! Was it a double
or a daiquiri?

1519
01:45:06,199 --> 01:45:09,180
Wait a minute.
All right!

1520
01:45:10,039 --> 01:45:12,460
Thank you!

1521
01:45:12,439 --> 01:45:15,210
Whoa. A little conference here, Wilk.
A little conference. Time out, everyone.

1522
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:20,300
This not like a real baseball. It's much
smaller and harder than-- than this one.

1523
01:45:21,079 --> 01:45:23,609
You got me there, Wilk, because--
I'm sorry. We have no budget, you see.

1524
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:27,289
And I gotta get on a plane,
and we have to do with what we can.
Give me your hand.

1525
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,689
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you all the same.

1526
01:45:30,199 --> 01:45:33,640
- Thank you all the same, and--
You wanna take the ball?
- No.

1527
01:45:34,039 --> 01:45:36,000
Okay. We gotta play, Wilk.
You're pitchin'. There's only--

1528
01:45:36,439 --> 01:45:38,329
I want to turn in the ball to the--
see, the original place.

1529
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:41,510
- Okay. Let's take one more ball here.
This one's a better one.
- No, no.

1530
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,890
- Not that one?
- No need.
- We haven't got a real baseball, Wilk.

1531
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,770
- Bear with me, okay?
- Okay.
- We haven't got the money, pal.

1532
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,909
- Anyway--
- Okay? Is that one okay?
- I accept that this is
a very good substitute.

1533
01:45:50,359 --> 01:45:53,029
- Okay. Let's just play
with the substitute then, okay?
- Okay.

1534
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,859
- Okay.
- This is a deal.
- It's a deal?
- This is a deal.

1535
01:45:56,119 --> 01:45:58,510
Okay, take the ball with you,
then, Wilk. I'll give you money
if you take the ball.

1536
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,649
- No.
- No?
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

1537
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:04,180
- I'm-I'm-- I've no money. Sorry.
- Is there a psychiatrist here?

1538
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:09,890
Whoa! Whoa!

1539
01:46:10,039 --> 01:46:12,390
Whoa! Whoa!

1540
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:16,609
Yeah! Go!
Run, run, run! Okay.

1541
01:46:17,239 --> 01:46:19,659
He's not out till you have
both hands on the ball!

1542
01:46:20,119 --> 01:46:22,609
Keep your eye on the fruit.
That's it. Eye on the fruit.

1543
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,680
Okay, on the fruit,
on the fruit.

1544
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,239
- Go, go! Run, Minh! Run!
- Come on, Minh!
- Run, Minh!

1545
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:32,329
Keep go-- Keep going!

1546
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:36,949
- She's actually goin' home.
- Well, I'm goin'out West
where I belong

1547
01:46:37,399 --> 01:46:42,319
- That's it. We'll all change sides.
- Where the days are short
and the night are long

1548
01:46:43,159 --> 01:46:45,930
- Yes, Wilkie!
- Well, they walk and I walk

1549
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:49,260
- They twist and I'll twist
- Hey, Wilk. Wilk, you got a base hit.

1550
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:53,880
they shimmy and I'll shimmy
The fly and I'll fly

1551
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:56,729
Well, they're out there
a-havin'fun

1552
01:46:57,079 --> 01:46:59,430
In that warm California sun

1553
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:02,909
Well, I'm goin'out West
out on the roast

1554
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:07,250
Where the California girls
are really the most

1555
01:47:10,039 --> 01:47:11,930
Where they walk
and I'll walk

1556
01:47:12,439 --> 01:47:14,859
They twist
and I'll twist

1557
01:47:15,319 --> 01:47:18,340
They shimmy
and I'll shimmy

1558
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,890
They fly
and I'll fly

1559
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:23,810
Well, they're out there
havin'fun

1560
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:26,729
In that warm California sun

1561
01:47:32,119 --> 01:47:34,399
Yeah, me too.
Hey, hey. Oh, hey.

1562
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,140
When you look like Goliath,
so might you...

1563
01:47:37,399 --> 01:47:40,000
- You take care. Take care.
- beware of-of some-some David.

1564
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:42,439
We had a great day.

1565
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:45,250
Thank you.

1566
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,140
Well, Mr Cronauer,
we, we thank-thank you for your
fine teaching about softball...

1567
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:55,699
and we have learned a lot from you
and we wish you good luck and success.

1568
01:47:56,119 --> 01:47:57,729
- Thank you, Wilkie.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1569
01:47:58,039 --> 01:47:59,970
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1570
01:48:06,199 --> 01:48:09,079
- You guys ready to go?
- Can you give me a minute?

1571
01:48:12,439 --> 01:48:15,279
Man, he's gonna say goodbye to
the whole goddam country now.

1572
01:48:24,439 --> 01:48:27,390
I want to say goodbye
before you go.

1573
01:48:30,199 --> 01:48:32,020
To tell you...

1574
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:34,989
thank you for being so kind.

1575
01:48:36,439 --> 01:48:39,319
So many things not happen
the way you want it.

1576
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:45,239
You so good person...

1577
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:47,520
but I could not with you.

1578
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,949
We are so different.

1579
01:48:52,279 --> 01:48:54,529
I say "tomato."
You say "xioh phoung."

1580
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,409
See you.

1581
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:29,930
- Staggers the imagination.
- Makes me unique, doesn't it?

1582
01:49:30,199 --> 01:49:34,029
- What a plus.
- Flip them the bird!

1583
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,489
Left, right!

1584
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:19,329
Three, four!

1585
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,770
Left, left!
Left, right, left!

1586
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:29,529
Left, left!
Left, right, left!

1587
01:50:33,039 --> 01:50:36,479
Left, left!
Left, right, left!

1588
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:59,079
It was a pleasure making
your acquaintance, sir. Thanks.

1589
01:50:59,439 --> 01:51:03,229
- Cut that out, Garlick.
We're the same rank.
- What will I do without you, sir?

1590
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:07,170
- Well, you carry on, Montesque.
- Cary on, Montesque.

1591
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:11,939
Carry on. I like that. It makes me feel,
uh, British or something.

1592
01:51:12,399 --> 01:51:14,569
I've got something here
for you.

1593
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,710
I want you to play this. It says
goodbye to everybody stayin' behind.

1594
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:20,899
- I'll take care of it pronto, sir.
- You could get in trouble for that.

1595
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,680
I requisitioned for a name change.
Trouble is actually my new middle name.

1596
01:51:28,239 --> 01:51:30,939
Well, I'll give you the old chuck
on the shoulder now.

1597
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:34,409
It's a stupid thing to do,
isn't it?

1598
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,960
You take care.

1599
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:39,890
Ed, your fly's open.

1600
01:51:40,239 --> 01:51:42,800
Made you look.

1601
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:07,399
Good morning, Vietnam!

1602
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:10,680
This is Eddie Garlick
coming to you live from AFRS...

1603
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,890
Armed Forces Radio Saigon.

1604
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:17,220
It's 1629 hours here in Saigon,
and Airman Adrian Cronauer
is going home today.

1605
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:21,229
But he left a farewell message
for all you guys out there
still sweating it out in the fields.

1606
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,300
So without further ado,
here's a farewell extravaganza.

1607
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:29,350
Goodbye, Vietnam!

1608
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:32,869
That's right, I'm history, I'm out of
here, I got the luck ticket home, baby,

1609
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:36,500
Rollin; rollin; rollin'
Keep them wagons rollin'. Rawhide

1610
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:39,130
Yeah, that's right,
The final Adrian Cronauer broadcast.

1611
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:42,039
And this one is brought to you
b your friends at the Pentagon.

1612
01:52:42,159 --> 01:52:45,180
Remember the people who brought you
Korea? That's right, the US Army.

1613
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:49,170
If it's being done correctly,
here or abroad, it's probably
not being done by the Army.

1614
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,930
"I heard that, "Oh, ho,
you're here!Good to see you,

1615
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:57,819
"I'm here to make sure
you don't say anything controversial."

1616
01:52:58,479 --> 01:53:02,380
Speaking of things controversial,
is it true that there is
a mariruana problem here in Vietnam?

1617
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:06,060
"No, it's not a problem,
Everybody has it."

1618
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,890
"I don't know, Adrian, "
Leo! Leo.

1619
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:13,279
'Adrian, take care of yourself
I just want you to know one thing,

1620
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:16,930
If you're going to be dressing in
civilian clothes, don't forget pumps."

1621
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:19,619
Thanh you, Leo. Thanks for these,
Oh, these are special.

1622
01:53:20,079 --> 01:53:23,659
"They're ruby slippers, Adrian.
Put these on and say,
'There's no place like home...

1623
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:26,890
there's no place like home,'
and you can be there."

1624
01:53:27,279 --> 01:53:29,770
I hope.
I hope we all could.
