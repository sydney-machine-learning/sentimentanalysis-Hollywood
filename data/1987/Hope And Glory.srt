1
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:25,737
In the dim light of early morning...

2
00:01:25,907 --> 00:01:28,694
...perhaps also in the dim light
between peace and war...

3
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:30,742
...the king returns to London.

4
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:33,450
A few hours later, His Majesty
holds a Privy Council.

5
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:36,742
<i>While hour by hour, the tension grows
all over the world.</i>

6
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,375
Before lunch, Mr. Chamberlain returns
from an audience with the king.

7
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:44,758
In the afternoon, Parliament assembles
to write a new page in its long history.

8
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:48,336
There has been no doubt that every
British citizen would play his part.

9
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:51,881
London prepares its defences
against attack from the air.

10
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,935
It's every citizen's duty to know
what to do should an air raid come.

11
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:02,725
Do you know the warning signal? To
remind you, we repeat them, softly...

12
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:06,602
...to avoid alarming anyone who
might hear them outside this theatre.

13
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:09,405
All clear.

14
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:13,949
Have you brought your gas masks
for your family?

15
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:18,071
It was all they talk ed about,
getting ready for war...

16
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,161
...but nothing ever happened.

17
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:23,711
It was all words and no action.

18
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:31,336
Hop along Cassidy, on the other hand...

19
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:33,839
...now that was the real thing.

20
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,118
Sunday, the 3rd of September, 1939.

21
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,329
Everyone who is old enough and was there...

22
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:05,286
...remembers exactly what they
were doing at that moment.

23
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:08,500
I had just gunned down
a couple of rustlers.

24
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:11,884
And then I slipped back a few centuries...

25
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:15,802
...and I was riding
through an enchanted forest.

26
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:19,516
The magician Merlin
suddenly appeared before me...

27
00:03:19,686 --> 00:03:22,177
...and my horse reared up in terror.

28
00:03:22,397 --> 00:03:26,727
Then something even more
extraordinary happened.

29
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:31,315
All the Sunday-morning lawnmowers
suddenly stopped.

30
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:41,365
This is London. You will now hear
a statement by the prime minister.

31
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:47,123
I am speaking to you from
the Cabinet room in 10 Downing Street.

32
00:03:47,297 --> 00:03:51,509
This morning,
the British ambassador in Berlin...

33
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:55,170
...handed the German government
a final note...

34
00:03:55,347 --> 00:04:00,341
...stating that unless we heard
from them by 11:00...

35
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,097
...that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland...

36
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:08,725
...a state of war would exist between us.

37
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:10,812
I have to tell you now...

38
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:13,739
...that no such undertaking
has been received...

39
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:16,742
...and that consequently, this country...

40
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,409
...is at war with Germany.

41
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,115
His actions show convincingly...

42
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,951
Stop that, Sue!

43
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:28,335
She just sings it,
she doesn't even know what it means.

44
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,458
Where are my stockings?
I can't find my stockings.

45
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:35,924
Dawn, pet, they've started war.

46
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:38,800
Have they? That's not my fault.

47
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:41,050
I still need my stockings, don't I?

48
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:43,799
I don't want to hear about your stockings!

49
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:48,773
It's an air raid!

50
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:51,859
Good God. They've started already.

51
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,395
Air raid!

52
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:57,657
Get down! Stay down!

53
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:10,710
It's the all clear.

54
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:12,999
Testing.

55
00:05:13,174 --> 00:05:14,965
They were just testing.

56
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:19,215
We all expected to be bombed right
away, but nothing happened for ages.

57
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,547
It was a perfect summer's morning...

58
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:25,176
...and everyone said, "Fancy starting
a war on such a beautiful day."

59
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:28,270
Such a beautiful day to...

60
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,484
A few lawnmowers started up again,
but they didn't ring true somehow.

61
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:35,944
Nothing would ever be the same again.

62
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:40,780
Are you gonna give me a hand, Mac, or not?

63
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:43,822
Dad, it's full of water again.

64
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:46,487
Oh, blast!

65
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,376
Comes up through the clay.

66
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:53,209
You should've sealed it with hot pitch.
Caulked it, like the hull of a ship.

67
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:58,959
It's not fair on them.
It's selfish to keep them with you.

68
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:02,470
You remember that aunt
I told you about in Australia?

69
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,266
- Well, she has offered to have them.
- Snap it up.

70
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:10,599
Great chance for them.
I mean, a lot more future out there.

71
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:13,940
It's so far away.

72
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:17,404
I couldn't bear it.

73
00:06:18,572 --> 00:06:21,242
Building an air-raid shelter
is hungry work, Grace.

74
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,445
Well, a few bombs
might wake up this country.

75
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:32,121
Take more than a few bombs
to wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.

76
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:35,794
- This phoney war gets on my nerves.
- Morning.

77
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:38,456
If we're going to have a war,
I wish they'd start.

78
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:41,635
- Now, now, Dawn.
- Just ignore her, Mac.

79
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:45,007
Well, this waiting about's
getting us all down.

80
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:47,507
We'll have to wait
about 10 minutes for lunch.

81
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:50,176
- Still remember your drill, Mac?
- There you are.

82
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:51,848
Hup, two, three, dash.

83
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:55,391
You see that?
The moths haven't got this, then.

84
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:57,809
You kept the old Sam Browne
all these years?

85
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:00,275
- Certainly.
- And kept it polished.

86
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:03,152
Might come in useful.

87
00:07:05,703 --> 00:07:07,327
Oh, steady. Steady.

88
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:10,165
Having received His Majesty's permission...

89
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:13,997
...I have formed an administration
of men and women of every party...

90
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,376
...and of almost every point of view.

91
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:19,832
- Now one bond unites us all: - Dad.

92
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,262
To wage war until victory is won...

93
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:28,967
...and never to surrender ourselves
to servitude and shame...

94
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:31,093
...whatever the cost...
- Come on.

95
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,595
...and the agony may be.

96
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:36,807
Bloody gin.

97
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:40,686
Always makes me cry.

98
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:44,113
Couple of crossed wires.
She only weeps when she's happy.

99
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:47,076
Oh, stop it, Molly.
You'll start me off now.

100
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:49,201
Now, Grace, Grace...

101
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:52,288
It's duty, Mac. It's our duty.

102
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:54,783
For a mug, Clive.
We did our bit in the last lot.

103
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:58,918
King and country call, Mac.
You'll go as soon as I will.

104
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,090
What did we know? Couple of kids, 17.

105
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:06,126
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac...

106
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:08,511
...marching past.

107
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:11,258
Made my hair stand on end.

108
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:13,643
There we go.

109
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:15,555
There we go, Mol.

110
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:20,104
- We've been asleep for 20 years.
- Go to hell!

111
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:22,234
Come on.

112
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:25,781
- Good night, Molly.
- Good night.

113
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:31,990
Do you know what time it is?
Go to bed this minute.

114
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:39,119
Don't worry, Sue. We're not gonna be
like them when we grow up.

115
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:42,083
We're not even like them now.

116
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:53,928
<i>We're standing in the pouring rain
off the side of...</i>

117
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:57,180
- a road squelching with mud
and lined right away...

118
00:08:57,355 --> 00:09:02,147
...over the plain to the far skyline with
the inevitable double row of poplars.

119
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:06,233
A few lorries only are splashing by
to and from the forward areas.

120
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:08,197
Coming down the road towards us...

121
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:11,402
<i>...is a battalion that I know
to be the famous Irish Regiment.</i>

122
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,953
They're marching in threes.
And in their full battle dress and kit...

123
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:18,077
...they blend with the dripping
green grass of the roadside...

124
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:20,244
...and the brown haystacks.

125
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,167
Forward!

126
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,290
I rode into battle with a drawn sword
against the Turks.

127
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:31,221
<i>Don't be a mug.
We did our bit in the last lot.</i>

128
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:34,010
- Don't be a mug.
- I heard the drum and fife yesterday.

129
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:36,093
- This country...
- Marching past.

130
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:39,104
- Made my hair stand on end.
... is at war with Germany.

131
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:41,893
<i>- A couple of kids, 17.
- I fought against the Turks.</i>

132
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:46,479
- Your place is with Grace and the kids!
... wage war until victory is won.

133
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:48,362
Dad!

134
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:50,779
Dad!

135
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:03,619
Uncle Mac.

136
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:13,847
Dad.

137
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,721
- Dad.
- Get up, boys.

138
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:22,519
- Well, it's lovely to see you.
- Absolutely smashing to see you.

139
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,232
- Take care of yourself.
- And you.

140
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,024
- See you in uniform, eh?
- Yeah.

141
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,437
- Take care.
- Take care.

142
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:32,773
Hello, kids.

143
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,234
Oh, sorry, kids.

144
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:40,747
I joined up.

145
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:46,587
I needed some Dutch courage
to tell your mother.

146
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:50,502
- Never say "die."
- Steady the Buffs.

147
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,378
Up the arsenal!

148
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:09,314
He's one of the best.

149
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:18,860
Get away.

150
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:30,416
Daddy, you shut his hand in the door.

151
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:32,916
Silly beggar.

152
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:38,471
We're trying to win a war...

153
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:41,968
...and you start off by shutting
your fingers in a car door.

154
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,011
My hand. Sorry.

155
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,020
That's it for the duration.

156
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:59,446
Pop in and give her a polish, Billy boy...

157
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,659
...just now and then.

158
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:04,956
A car needs to be cherished.

159
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,908
Has Sue got it right?

160
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,043
What's that?

161
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:14,748
- You joined up.
- Oh, that.

162
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:17,628
I wish you could have told me yourself.

163
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,880
Oh, Grace, it's not for long.

164
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,548
They say it'll be over by Christmas.

165
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:24,847
Hey.

166
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,348
No, leave me...

167
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:28,805
I don't want...

168
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,227
Stop it.

169
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:36,395
Don't be daft. Act your age.

170
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:47,660
I can't cope on my own.

171
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:52,464
I better let the children go.

172
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:58,627
Nice catch, Billy.

173
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:13,811
Billy...

174
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,897
...before I go, there's something
I want to tell you.

175
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:20,192
You're not quite old enough, but...

176
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:22,366
Well...

177
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,698
It's the googly.

178
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,366
Your hand is too small to master it.

179
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:32,494
But you can make a start.

180
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:38,460
Anyway, I'm gonna pass on the secret
now, father to son, in case...

181
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,836
In case anything happens to me.

182
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,056
All right.

183
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:47,559
Now...

184
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,265
You know the leg break, right?

185
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:55,562
And the off break.

186
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:59,361
Now, the googly looks like a leg break...

187
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,697
...but it's really an off break. Got it?

188
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,492
Like this.

189
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,780
- That's like telling fibs.
- That's it.

190
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:10,453
When you tell a lie,
you want to get away with it.

191
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,294
But when someone else does,
you want to find them out.

192
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:19,131
A good batsman will spot a googly.
A good bowler will hide it.

193
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,334
Always remember that, son.

194
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:26,046
Bye, Grace.

195
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:27,766
Oh, Grace.

196
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:30,306
Tap's running.

197
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,475
Must go.

198
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,782
Be good.

199
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:49,027
- Bye-bye, Daddy.
- Bye, Dawn. Take care of Susie.

200
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,031
Bye, Billy.

201
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:57,662
Billy.

202
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,502
- Goodbye, Billy.
- Billy.

203
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,050
Don't forget what I told you.

204
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:09,468
Dad!

205
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:21,604
Dad!

206
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:24,187
Dad!

207
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:39,372
Bye-bye, darling. There you are.

208
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:43,420
- I wish I could pack you up.
- Bye-bye. You take care, won't you?

209
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,003
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

210
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:49,263
We used to go away on our own
all the time, didn't we, Grace?

211
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:51,340
Ever so young.

212
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,471
You survive that lot,
the war should be no problem, son.

213
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:58,227
- Time to go.
- Oh, let's see them off.

214
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:06,069
Here is a special announcement.

215
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,985
Parents bringing children to the 4 p. m.
Special freight train to Southampton...

216
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:16,156
...are ask ed to leave their children
at the barrier to platform nine.

217
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,993
<i>We regret that no parents can be
allowed onto the platform.</i>

218
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,917
Please leave your children
at the barrier...

219
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:28,173
...and ensure that they carry the
correct labels for their destinations.

220
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:30,136
- Thank you.
- Bye.

221
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:31,965
Bye.

222
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,634
Australia?

223
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:36,560
Say goodbye and pass them through.

224
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:38,603
All right, Bill.

225
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,896
It won't be long, darling.
It won't be long, Susie.

226
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:48,194
Here, take the case, Bill.

227
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:49,645
Thank you.

228
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:52,362
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye, Susie.

229
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:55,993
I'll see you soon. Promise.

230
00:16:56,873 --> 00:17:00,918
I'm gonna miss the war.
And it's all your fault.

231
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:04,461
Parents may not go beyond the barriers.

232
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:08,088
Come on through.
Let's have a look at your label.

233
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:12,543
- I can't do it. What's the point?
- Grace, Grace.

234
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:16,923
Let me through. I want my family!

235
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:20,138
No one goes in there.
You signed the forms, didn't you?

236
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:23,931
Yes, I did. And now I want them back!

237
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,852
- Come on.
- It's too late.

238
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:28,601
They're very lucky
to have got a place at all.

239
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:33,241
- Mac!
- Wait there.

240
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:36,824
Susie. Susie!

241
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,614
Come on, Susie, we're going home.

242
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:49,165
Susie.

243
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:51,002
Here, take...

244
00:17:51,177 --> 00:17:54,095
Leave me alone. I want to go. I want to go.

245
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:57,348
In front of everybody!
They were all looking at us.

246
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:00,008
Why did you have to do it?

247
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:02,600
Please yourself.

248
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:07,936
- Come on!
- Grace.

249
00:18:09,737 --> 00:18:12,691
- Changed your mind again?
- Yes, I have.

250
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,570
- Come on, let's go.
- Well, you're too late. Apply again.

251
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:18,234
On your head, be it.

252
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,574
Come on, kids.

253
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:23,073
Come on. It's all right.

254
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:28,998
Billy.

255
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:35,463
Billy, come on, now. I'm sorry.

256
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,052
Wake up. Out of bed.

257
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:41,095
Susie, come on, darling.

258
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,718
Come on, up you get.

259
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:51,396
We better go down to the shelter.

260
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:54,859
- There we go.
- There we go.

261
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,074
Come on, Dawn, get your things.

262
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:16,719
It's freezing out.

263
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:23,013
All right, under the stairs.

264
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:32,147
In you get, Susie.

265
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:35,815
All right, Billy, light the candle.

266
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:46,370
There we go.

267
00:19:48,502 --> 00:19:51,836
What would we do if a German
came into the house?

268
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:54,294
- Oh, Dawn, don't be silly.
- Well...

269
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,004
...why do you always bring
the carving knife in here?

270
00:19:57,177 --> 00:19:58,885
Well, you never know.

271
00:19:59,054 --> 00:20:00,596
Listen.

272
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:02,721
Footsteps.

273
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:05,263
It's getting closer.

274
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:11,224
Got him.

275
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,069
It's all right. She's only teasing, pet.

276
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:18,774
Flak!

277
00:20:23,203 --> 00:20:24,911
Carpet bombing.

278
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:27,791
Two and three...

279
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,081
...four and five...

280
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:32,209
...and six and...

281
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:35,042
I should have taken you
down to the shelter.

282
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:38,880
And four and five and six...

283
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:41,377
Why didn't I let you go to Australia?

284
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:46,300
- And three and four and five
and six and...

285
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,060
The next one's ours.
Either it hits us or it goes past.

286
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:55,188
Oh, please, God, not on us.
Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.

287
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,733
Well, I'm not going to die in here
like a rat in a trap.

288
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:04,323
- Let me out. I'm going outside.
- No. Dawn. Dawn.

289
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:08,569
- I'm going. I'm going out.
- Dawn.

290
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:19,338
It's lovely. Lovely. Come and see
the fireworks, Billy.

291
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:21,715
Cor, look at that.

292
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:25,469
Get out of there!

293
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,800
Shrapnel.

294
00:21:28,518 --> 00:21:30,676
It's still hot.

295
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:38,648
Get back!

296
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:43,233
Stay right where you are.
Susie, don't you move.

297
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:46,823
Come in at once.

298
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:49,826
I wash my hands of you if you don't go in.

299
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:51,706
Come on!

300
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,197
Come on!

301
00:21:57,297 --> 00:21:59,752
Get that water pressure up!

302
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:12,306
- Stand back.
- Get inside.

303
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:14,471
Get inside.

304
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:22,195
That poor woman.

305
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:26,232
Poor old London.

306
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:42,712
I think it's safe. Have you
got your sandwiches, Susie?

307
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:44,752
Now, Billy...

308
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:49,555
...keep to the pavement
and don't dawdle. Off you go.

309
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:55,020
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye-bye, Dawn.

310
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:58,810
- Could have been us, Evelyn.
- That's right.

311
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:06,234
There's so much shrapnel.

312
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,407
I'm so sorry, Peggy.

313
00:23:09,577 --> 00:23:12,150
Come with us and have some breakfast.

314
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:26,498
That's from a land-mine.

315
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:38,730
Fuck.

316
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:40,856
God.

317
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:43,603
But...

318
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:48,240
- Fuck.
- But...

319
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:50,277
Oh, God.

320
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,747
Line up. Line up. Get in line.
Come on, now.

321
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:04,251
Dressing from the right.

322
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:12,879
Late. My study before prayers.

323
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:14,640
Eyes front.

324
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:17,346
Keep still down there, you little ones.

325
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,473
It's discipline that wins wars.

326
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:24,020
Right turn.

327
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:26,351
Quick march. Left, right.

328
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:29,944
Left, right. Left, right. Swing those arms.

329
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,492
O God, bring destruction to our enemies.

330
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:39,162
Make these young ones
true soldiers of the Lord.

331
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:43,330
Guide Mr. Churchill's hand
in the cunning of war.

332
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:48,919
Let our righteous shells smite down
the Messerschmitts and the Fokkers.

333
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:54,762
Lord, send troublesome dreams
to Herr Hitler.

334
00:24:55,098 --> 00:24:58,301
Let him not sleep
the sleep of the innocent.

335
00:24:58,477 --> 00:25:01,264
And comfort our warriors at the fronts.

336
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:05,436
Brighten their swords and burnish
their bullets with your fire.

337
00:25:06,735 --> 00:25:11,195
We beseech thee, O Lord,
to have mercy on these, thy children.

338
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:16,193
We dedicate our studies this day
to the war effort.

339
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:17,449
Amen.

340
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:21,162
Hymn number 540.

341
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:25,282
"Fight the Good Fight With All Thy Might."

342
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:27,911
Pink. Pink.

343
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:29,715
Pink.

344
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:36,089
What are all the pink bits? Rohan?

345
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:39,553
- They're ours, miss.
- Yes.

346
00:25:39,768 --> 00:25:42,259
They're British Empire.

347
00:25:42,437 --> 00:25:44,180
Harper.

348
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:48,307
What fraction of the Earth's surface
is British?

349
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:50,109
Don't know, miss.

350
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,645
Anyone?

351
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:56,905
Jennifer Baker.

352
00:25:57,076 --> 00:26:00,659
- Two-fifths, miss.
- Yes. Two-fifths.

353
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,289
Ours.

354
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:05,742
That's what this war is all about.

355
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,794
Men are fighting and dying
to save all the pink bits...

356
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:14,417
...for you ungrateful little twerps.

357
00:26:14,802 --> 00:26:19,180
Page 17. "The British Empire."

358
00:26:20,516 --> 00:26:23,636
Books away. Scramble.

359
00:26:25,104 --> 00:26:26,267
Come on, quickly.

360
00:26:28,024 --> 00:26:30,100
Now, come along. You all know the drill.

361
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:32,316
Don't push me!

362
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:34,313
Stop it!

363
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:43,365
Come on.

364
00:26:59,931 --> 00:27:03,097
Settle down. Settle down. Be quiet.

365
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:05,592
Gas masks on.

366
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,977
These masks are given us...

367
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:11,765
...to filter away
the abominations of the enemy.

368
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:16,112
When you breathe,
you breathe slowly. In. Out.

369
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,609
Don't panic.

370
00:27:17,782 --> 00:27:19,905
In. Out.

371
00:27:20,284 --> 00:27:23,320
Now, we'll do our nine times table.

372
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,488
One nine is nine.

373
00:27:25,664 --> 00:27:27,574
Two nines are 18.

374
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,157
Three nines are 27.

375
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:32,958
Four nines are 36.

376
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:36,042
Five nines are 45.

377
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:38,375
Six nines are 54.

378
00:27:39,178 --> 00:27:41,799
Seven nines are 63.

379
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:44,511
Eight nines are 72.

380
00:27:44,725 --> 00:27:47,430
Nine nines are 81.

381
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:53,435
Look, Sue!

382
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,405
Stand by.

383
00:28:04,578 --> 00:28:07,247
Stand by. Move away.

384
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:13,833
- Starboard crew ready.
- Take up the slack.

385
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:16,080
Undo these binds.

386
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:18,871
- What's it for?
- When the German planes...

387
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:21,968
...fly in at night,
they can't see the cables.

388
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:27,307
Look out. I can't hold it.

389
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,633
I hope it stays through
the whole of the war.

390
00:28:33,982 --> 00:28:37,102
- Get these children out of here, please.
- Get back! Back!

391
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:48,235
I have to let it go.

392
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:28,193
Rohan, what are you doing here?
This is our territory.

393
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,742
- Looking for shrapnel.
- Get him!

394
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,910
Take him to HQ, but blindfold him first.

395
00:29:36,878 --> 00:29:38,835
What have you got?

396
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:41,172
Look. It's a detonator.

397
00:29:41,341 --> 00:29:44,010
You won't see through this.

398
00:29:57,982 --> 00:30:00,687
Unexploded.

399
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:05,478
- You were spying.
- I never was.

400
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:07,614
Yes, you were.

401
00:30:07,826 --> 00:30:10,317
We'll make him talk.

402
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:14,407
Live ammunition, .303.

403
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:16,575
Bring him here.

404
00:30:25,718 --> 00:30:28,256
- Talk or else.
- Talk.

405
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,210
Talk.

406
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:34,430
- Yeah, talk.
- I know a secret.

407
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:36,511
I'll tell you a secret.

408
00:30:36,688 --> 00:30:38,230
What's that?

409
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,897
The Germans are dropping men
on the bomb sites.

410
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:45,187
Who told you that?

411
00:30:45,363 --> 00:30:49,313
My uncle's in the War Office. He said,
"Don't go on the bomb sites.

412
00:30:49,492 --> 00:30:52,030
Boys are going missing all the time."

413
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:54,901
- They're not.
- Are they?

414
00:30:55,081 --> 00:30:57,916
If you find them hiding,
they'll cut your throat.

415
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:00,041
- Would they?
- No, they don't.

416
00:31:00,211 --> 00:31:03,911
They have to, or they get found out.

417
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:08,468
I wish one would come
through the door right now.

418
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:22,730
- Do you wanna join our gang?
- Don't mind.

419
00:31:23,276 --> 00:31:26,229
- Do you know any swear words?
- Yes.

420
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:28,278
Say them.

421
00:31:28,864 --> 00:31:30,608
Go on.

422
00:31:31,117 --> 00:31:32,860
Say them.

423
00:31:33,244 --> 00:31:35,995
You can't join if you can't swear.

424
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,864
I only know one.

425
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:41,825
Well, say that one, then.

426
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:45,831
Go on.

427
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:48,416
Fuck.

428
00:31:52,096 --> 00:31:54,053
That word is special.

429
00:31:54,306 --> 00:31:57,971
That word is only used
for something really important.

430
00:31:58,143 --> 00:32:00,385
Now, repeat after me:

431
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:02,348
Bugger off.

432
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:05,019
Bugger off.

433
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:06,770
Sod.

434
00:32:06,986 --> 00:32:08,812
Sod.

435
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,115
- Bloody.
- Bloody.

436
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:13,860
Now put them all together:

437
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:16,157
Bugger off, you bloody sod.

438
00:32:16,328 --> 00:32:18,404
Bugger off, you bloody sod.

439
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:20,330
- Okay, you're in.
- Yeah.

440
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:22,575
Let's smash things up.

441
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:19,967
Get your things.

442
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:22,639
Balaclava.

443
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,849
Easy, easy.

444
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:33,562
- Can't we just see the end?
- They've got the real thing outside.

445
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,524
It's not the same.

446
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:42,818
A dogfight. You can't see what's happening.

447
00:33:52,215 --> 00:33:55,549
German plane. It's been hit.

448
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:06,553
Look, look.

449
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:09,013
- He's bailed out. Look.
- What's all the noise?

450
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,147
There are people trying to sleep up here.

451
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:16,026
- We got one! An Me-109.
- A parachute.

452
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,981
- Hey.
- Hey. Watch it, now.

453
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:08,324
- What's all this, then?
- It's a German pilot.

454
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:13,836
Go and get him.

455
00:35:14,714 --> 00:35:16,790
- Look out.
- Here, watch it.

456
00:35:19,802 --> 00:35:22,008
- That's it, yeah.
- That's it, you get onto him.

457
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:23,342
Go on.

458
00:35:23,514 --> 00:35:25,590
Behind you, boy.

459
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,188
All right.

460
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:45,359
You prisoner of war.

461
00:35:45,786 --> 00:35:47,909
This way.

462
00:35:49,749 --> 00:35:53,034
Mind Brussels sprouts.

463
00:35:56,964 --> 00:35:58,755
This way.

464
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:10,884
- Parachute silk.
- Parachute silk.

465
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:13,809
Parachute silk!

466
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:29,738
It's all crooked, Billy.

467
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:35,910
There. Now, do it again.

468
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:46,384
- Well, don't stop. Keep going.
- Nobody's gonna see that far up.

469
00:36:46,597 --> 00:36:51,223
Don't be so sure. When I jitterbug...

470
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:30,134
That was great for me. How was it for you?

471
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,053
Bit too quick.

472
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:37,395
Well, now we can do it slow.

473
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:44,357
Those some kind of new stockings
you're wearing?

474
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:47,614
- They might be.
- I mean, no garters.

475
00:37:47,782 --> 00:37:51,234
They just kind of disappear up your ass.

476
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,324
Hey, stop it! Help me, guys.

477
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:57,831
- This girl is beating on me.
- Get her. Get her.

478
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:10,253
- Enemy on your tail, Billy.
- Where? Where?

479
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:14,431
- Take avoiding action.
- I don't know how.

480
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:15,929
I can't.

481
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:17,681
I can't do it.

482
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:25,310
Use the googly, like I showed you.

483
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:53,841
Mind my shrapnel.

484
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:58,093
I'm starting my own collection.

485
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,428
That's Canadian. Where did you get it?

486
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:02,597
None of your business.

487
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:39,135
Susie, wakey-wakey.
Quick. Quick as lightning, now.

488
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:42,145
There we go. Billy.

489
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,855
Billy.

490
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:48,015
Come on, Billy. Wakey-wakey.
Quick, quick. Quick, march.

491
00:39:48,527 --> 00:39:50,070
Dawn.

492
00:39:50,237 --> 00:39:53,653
Dawn. Air raid.

493
00:39:56,118 --> 00:39:59,452
Dawn, what have you been up to? Come on.

494
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:04,699
I'm not going to that shelter.
I'd sooner die.

495
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:12,375
Dawn, come down here at once.

496
00:40:12,635 --> 00:40:15,801
Quick. Quick! Come on.

497
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,654
Oh, please, God. Please, God,
take me, but spare them.

498
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:46,408
Wait. Wait, Billy. Wait.

499
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,540
Run. Run.

500
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,679
- Get up, Billy.
- Mama!

501
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:16,194
Billy, are you all right?

502
00:41:16,365 --> 00:41:19,282
You don't care if I die.

503
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:22,535
- Susie.
- How could you leave me there...

504
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,663
...even if you don't love me?

505
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:31,168
Tell me the truth.
You had to get married, didn't you?

506
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:32,915
Because of me.

507
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:36,376
The ideas you get into your head.

508
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:40,881
That's why you never liked me.
I'm different from you.

509
00:41:41,056 --> 00:41:46,477
Well, everything's different now,
so it doesn't matter. So there.

510
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:03,283
Rohan!

511
00:42:03,453 --> 00:42:05,659
- Rohan!
- Oh, dear, have a cup of tea.

512
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,740
Pauline's mum got killed last night.

513
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:10,703
- She didn't.
- She did.

514
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:15,213
- Didn't she, Jennifer?
- Yes, she did. Killed stone-dead.

515
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,508
You can ask her. Ask Pauline.

516
00:42:18,718 --> 00:42:20,378
Isn't that right?

517
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:23,466
Your mum got killed last night.

518
00:42:24,182 --> 00:42:27,681
There you are. Told you.

519
00:42:28,895 --> 00:42:30,804
Do you feel rotten, Pauline?

520
00:42:39,697 --> 00:42:41,108
She does feel rotten.

521
00:42:41,574 --> 00:42:44,908
- Go and ask her if she wants to play.
- Ask her yourself.

522
00:42:45,078 --> 00:42:47,865
No, you ask her. You're a girl.

523
00:42:55,672 --> 00:42:57,415
Pauline.

524
00:42:57,715 --> 00:42:59,174
Pauline.

525
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:03,381
- Do you want some shrapnel?
- No.

526
00:43:05,515 --> 00:43:08,184
- Do you want to play?
- Go away.

527
00:43:08,393 --> 00:43:10,136
Terry.

528
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:12,470
Pauline's mum got killed last night.

529
00:43:12,647 --> 00:43:14,853
- She never.
- She did too.

530
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:17,017
You can ask her.

531
00:43:21,447 --> 00:43:23,903
Come on, luvvy,
you can't stay here all day.

532
00:43:24,075 --> 00:43:27,859
- I live here. I live here.
- Of course you do.

533
00:43:28,162 --> 00:43:30,949
Come on, now. Come on.

534
00:43:33,918 --> 00:43:37,750
- ...booze, football and the other thing.
- Mum. Mum.

535
00:43:37,922 --> 00:43:40,839
- Oh, Molly.
- Mummy, Mummy.

536
00:43:41,008 --> 00:43:44,757
- Soon have this lot sorted out for you.
- Look at this mess.

537
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:47,171
Mummy, Mummy, Pauline's mummy got killed.

538
00:43:47,348 --> 00:43:49,756
The East End's been burning
for three nights.

539
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:51,511
And Sendry's down there.

540
00:43:51,686 --> 00:43:56,976
- Count your blessings, Grace.
- I do, Molly, I do.

541
00:43:58,192 --> 00:43:59,520
Know what they're doing now?

542
00:43:59,694 --> 00:44:02,267
- Still not been hit, Mrs. Evans?
- Touch wood.

543
00:44:02,488 --> 00:44:04,196
We had a near miss the other night.

544
00:44:04,365 --> 00:44:07,781
Dropping diseased rats on the bomb sites.

545
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,245
Billy found this tiny little parachute.

546
00:44:11,414 --> 00:44:13,869
So that's what it was for.

547
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:18,503
Is the piano all right, Grace?
It's covered in dust.

548
00:44:18,796 --> 00:44:22,379
- Let's have a listen.
- Play something, Grace.

549
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:28,468
Recognize that, Dawn?

550
00:44:34,562 --> 00:44:37,562
Never used to sing so much
before the war, did we?

551
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:40,566
Not in the daytime, anyway.

552
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:51,906
- Dawn's come on fast.
- That's the war for you.

553
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,080
Quick, quick, quick.

554
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:02,332
Didn't I see you with a soldier, Dawn?

555
00:45:02,506 --> 00:45:04,629
Just doing my bit for the war effort.

556
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:08,469
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.

557
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:12,629
It's only a joke, Mummy.
I'm 15, I'm still at school.

558
00:45:12,808 --> 00:45:15,299
I want to be a nun when I grow up.

559
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:17,346
You.

560
00:45:18,564 --> 00:45:20,473
Come on, Grace.

561
00:45:20,649 --> 00:45:23,401
Give us a few bars of old Fred.

562
00:45:23,652 --> 00:45:27,602
- But my hand, Mac.
- Come on, Mummy.

563
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,149
Oh, all right.

564
00:46:02,482 --> 00:46:06,432
- Tell them about Pauline's mum.
- No.

565
00:46:06,903 --> 00:46:09,774
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.

566
00:47:01,124 --> 00:47:03,282
Look, I found the photograph of George.

567
00:47:03,459 --> 00:47:08,121
Beau, come on! Look what I've got!

568
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:32,024
Intruder. And it's a girl.

569
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:48,002
Take her to our den.

570
00:47:48,171 --> 00:47:50,626
I thought we said no girls allowed.

571
00:47:50,798 --> 00:47:53,467
We got a bed.

572
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:57,046
Roger.

573
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,008
Roger!

574
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:02,133
Oh, leave me alone.

575
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:04,893
Pauline.

576
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,944
No. I won't.

577
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:23,867
- Come on, Pauline, be a sport.
- No. I won't.

578
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,783
There's too many of you.

579
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,372
- One at a time, then.
- No.

580
00:48:28,544 --> 00:48:31,415
- I'll give you something.
- What?

581
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,919
Let go of me.

582
00:48:45,227 --> 00:48:47,267
All right, then. Line up.

583
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,305
On the board.

584
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:02,491
I've seen better than that.

585
00:49:12,629 --> 00:49:15,749
Ants in your pants.

586
00:49:20,345 --> 00:49:23,797
Well, come on, then. It won't bite.

587
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:29,765
Pack it in. It's time to smash things up.

588
00:49:34,568 --> 00:49:37,984
Total destruction, men!

589
00:49:51,418 --> 00:49:53,078
Go away.

590
00:50:01,219 --> 00:50:02,382
Hey.

591
00:50:03,055 --> 00:50:04,134
Hey!

592
00:50:05,474 --> 00:50:08,391
- Hey! What is this?
- Fuck!

593
00:50:09,561 --> 00:50:11,269
Come on.

594
00:50:12,105 --> 00:50:15,973
You stupid little critters! Stop it.
Come on. Come on.

595
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,938
To the rescue.

596
00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:22,108
He got me.

597
00:50:24,618 --> 00:50:26,575
You'll swallow this, stupid little kids.

598
00:50:26,745 --> 00:50:28,702
- Good shot.
- Stop it.

599
00:50:29,623 --> 00:50:31,615
You hear me, you knuckleheads? Stop it.

600
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:34,369
What a strike.

601
00:50:39,132 --> 00:50:43,759
Teach him a lesson. Think they can
come over here and take our women.

602
00:50:43,928 --> 00:50:47,048
Wasn't that your sister, Rohan?

603
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:10,580
And where do you think you're going?

604
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:12,616
Out.

605
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:15,281
Go upstairs this minute
and take off that lipstick.

606
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,618
No. I won't.

607
00:51:17,795 --> 00:51:20,880
You wouldn't dare defy me
if your father was here.

608
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,581
Get up the stairs. Get up those stairs.

609
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,167
If you've finished, I'm going.

610
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,803
You bitch.

611
00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:33,429
You.

612
00:51:33,603 --> 00:51:38,514
Why is it I can never ever get hold of you?

613
00:51:38,691 --> 00:51:41,811
Why is it that I cannot get
a hold on you anywhere?

614
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,747
I want him! I want him so much!

615
00:52:04,008 --> 00:52:07,591
I'll kill myself if I don't have him.

616
00:52:08,054 --> 00:52:09,678
There, there.

617
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:12,803
Oh, my baby.

618
00:52:17,229 --> 00:52:19,602
Go, if you want.

619
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:25,650
What does it matter?
We may all be dead tomorrow.

620
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,238
I can't go like this.

621
00:52:35,915 --> 00:52:39,497
You'd better bring him home
if you really do love him.

622
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:44,418
Don't kill love.

623
00:52:44,757 --> 00:52:48,208
You'll regret it for the rest of your life.

624
00:52:51,514 --> 00:52:53,921
Who said anything about love?

625
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,901
God, what a mess our street's in.

626
00:53:51,323 --> 00:53:53,031
Bill.

627
00:53:53,575 --> 00:53:55,153
Sue.

628
00:54:00,123 --> 00:54:03,077
I've been on a bike...

629
00:54:03,251 --> 00:54:05,624
- ...for five hours.
- Mum! Mum!

630
00:54:05,963 --> 00:54:10,671
I've only got a 36-hour pass.

631
00:54:17,474 --> 00:54:19,763
Hand me my backpack, Bill.

632
00:54:24,606 --> 00:54:26,017
Thanks.

633
00:54:30,779 --> 00:54:32,570
- What's that?
- Jam.

634
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:36,190
- Jam! Jam! Jam!
- Jam? What kind of jam?

635
00:54:36,368 --> 00:54:39,072
- It's not like any jam I know.
- German jam.

636
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:41,573
It's German jam.

637
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,450
Well, it's all right.

638
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:47,118
Came from a German ship.
Got sunk, this stuff washed ashore.

639
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,584
Crates of it. Jam.

640
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,710
Our boys found it on the beach
by the rifle range.

641
00:54:53,385 --> 00:54:57,513
- We don't know anything about it.
- Well, it's off ration. We know that.

642
00:54:57,681 --> 00:55:01,678
How do we know they didn't plant it
there? They know we are mad on jam.

643
00:55:01,851 --> 00:55:03,511
They could poison half the country.

644
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:13,067
Come away, kids. I don't want you
standing too close while he opens it.

645
00:55:13,238 --> 00:55:14,815
Come here, Susie.

646
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:27,457
Well?

647
00:55:32,882 --> 00:55:34,756
It looks foreign.

648
00:55:34,926 --> 00:55:37,678
Jam is jam! It's just...

649
00:55:37,845 --> 00:55:40,253
- ...jam.
- Well, I'm not having any.

650
00:55:40,431 --> 00:55:44,844
Even if it's not poisoned,
I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.

651
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:47,475
You don't like jam. You never eat jam.

652
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:50,316
- You hate jam.
- That's not the point.

653
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,985
Taste it. Why don't you taste it.

654
00:55:54,153 --> 00:55:56,312
You taste it.

655
00:56:25,643 --> 00:56:28,216
Give us some, Dad.

656
00:56:30,022 --> 00:56:32,644
That's it. Come on.

657
00:56:34,026 --> 00:56:37,276
You mean they let you go through
the officers' training course...

658
00:56:37,446 --> 00:56:40,116
...and then said you were too old
for a commission?

659
00:56:40,282 --> 00:56:41,314
That's it.

660
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:43,942
Why didn't they say that
before you started?

661
00:56:44,161 --> 00:56:46,487
I wasn't too old
when I started the course...

662
00:56:46,706 --> 00:56:48,532
...I was too old when I finished it.

663
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:52,576
- What are you going to be, then?
- A clerk.

664
00:56:53,087 --> 00:56:55,126
I'm doing a typing course.

665
00:56:55,548 --> 00:56:57,920
I shall be typing for England.

666
00:56:59,969 --> 00:57:01,842
Poor Clive.

667
00:57:02,429 --> 00:57:06,427
And you wanted it so much.

668
00:57:08,936 --> 00:57:11,225
You're such a baby.

669
00:57:11,897 --> 00:57:14,934
It's nice jam. It's nearly as nice
as English jam.

670
00:57:16,235 --> 00:57:17,895
You know what I always say:

671
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,691
Jam is jam the world over.

672
00:57:22,074 --> 00:57:23,533
- Hello, Bruce.
- Hi.

673
00:57:23,742 --> 00:57:28,488
Bruce, this is my father.
Dad, this is Corporal Bruce Carey.

674
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:33,825
Private Rohan.

675
00:57:35,337 --> 00:57:38,872
Bruce, look, Dad got some German jam.

676
00:57:39,299 --> 00:57:42,135
We thought it was poisoned.

677
00:57:52,396 --> 00:57:55,183
All the poison was at the bottom.

678
00:57:56,984 --> 00:58:00,851
- Here's a peg, Mummy.
- Thank you, Susie.

679
00:58:01,363 --> 00:58:03,356
When do you think you'll get leave again?

680
00:58:03,532 --> 00:58:06,070
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.

681
00:58:08,954 --> 00:58:10,946
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.

682
00:58:11,123 --> 00:58:14,289
- Hello.
- Welcome home, pet.

683
00:58:14,459 --> 00:58:16,950
Hello, darling. You look marvellous.

684
00:58:17,129 --> 00:58:18,837
- Hello, Clive.
- Hello, Mac, old boy.

685
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:21,710
- Good to see you.
- Look what Moll's got.

686
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,379
Tears before bedtime.

687
00:58:23,552 --> 00:58:27,336
Dad, come to the bomb site now.
You promised.

688
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:32,967
Careful, Billy.

689
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:39,139
What kind of war is it, Mac?

690
00:58:46,825 --> 00:58:49,446
Dad, up here.

691
00:58:51,204 --> 00:58:54,371
Up there in Cumberland,
we never see an air raid.

692
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:58,159
The worst problem I have
is getting a new typewriter ribbon.

693
00:58:58,336 --> 00:59:01,456
When I rode in against the Turks,
I knew what it was about.

694
00:59:01,673 --> 00:59:05,753
Did you? You thought you did.

695
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,471
We've been gypped all our lives, Smiler.

696
00:59:10,307 --> 00:59:13,307
- Take your street.
- What about it?

697
00:59:13,476 --> 00:59:15,220
Rosehill Avenue:

698
00:59:15,395 --> 00:59:18,515
No roses, no bloody hill,
and it's certainly not an avenue.

699
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:21,525
- Why not?
- Well, you need trees for an avenue.

700
00:59:21,693 --> 00:59:24,266
There was talk of planting some
when we first came.

701
00:59:24,446 --> 00:59:28,064
Propaganda. We've been had.

702
00:59:28,825 --> 00:59:30,782
How's your war, Mac?

703
00:59:31,202 --> 00:59:32,827
Never done better.

704
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:34,988
On the fiddle, same as everyone else.

705
00:59:35,165 --> 00:59:38,699
- Except for servicemen.
- Naturally.

706
00:59:39,377 --> 00:59:40,955
Don't understand.

707
00:59:41,129 --> 00:59:44,961
- Is there no point to any of it?
- There is, all right. This Hitler fellow.

708
00:59:45,174 --> 00:59:47,132
We've gotta winkle him out...

709
00:59:47,343 --> 00:59:50,463
...get shucked of some of our lot
at the same time.

710
00:59:53,308 --> 00:59:55,633
Look how wild that boy's got.

711
00:59:56,185 --> 01:00:01,143
As for Dawn, 16, going around
with a soldier.

712
01:00:02,942 --> 01:00:06,358
Keep an eye on them for me,
Mac, will you? There's a pal.

713
01:00:06,529 --> 01:00:08,687
I made a mess of it all.

714
01:00:09,741 --> 01:00:12,492
I'm such a bloody fool.

715
01:00:12,952 --> 01:00:14,861
You always were, Smiler.

716
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,619
Steady the Buffs.

717
01:00:17,999 --> 01:00:20,205
Bugger the Buffs.

718
01:00:20,585 --> 01:00:23,751
Dad, look. The barrage balloon.

719
01:00:31,888 --> 01:00:33,382
A rogue balloon.

720
01:00:33,556 --> 01:00:36,557
- The fins are punctured.
- Yeah, it's lost stability.

721
01:00:40,187 --> 01:00:43,687
- What is it?
- It's a rogue balloon.

722
01:00:43,858 --> 01:00:45,850
A rogue balloon?

723
01:01:06,547 --> 01:01:10,497
- Oh, no!
- It's coming this way.

724
01:01:12,261 --> 01:01:16,722
- Don't panic. Keep your heads.
- I will if you will.

725
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:26,891
Bloody hell.

726
01:01:28,068 --> 01:01:29,812
Get back. Come on. Get back.

727
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:33,687
Come on, get back a ways.

728
01:01:35,826 --> 01:01:38,115
It's wonderful.

729
01:01:38,287 --> 01:01:43,245
Aren't they lovely when they're full,
and isn't it sad when they sag?

730
01:01:43,959 --> 01:01:48,787
He just got fed up and decided
it was time to have some fun.

731
01:01:49,548 --> 01:01:51,706
There we go.

732
01:01:52,259 --> 01:01:53,919
Look at its bonny...

733
01:01:54,428 --> 01:01:58,508
Get back. Get back.
Home Guard coming through.

734
01:02:00,476 --> 01:02:03,430
- Get back.
- Get inside.

735
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:12,855
Oh, leave it alone.

736
01:02:20,454 --> 01:02:24,072
Why did they have to go and do that?

737
01:02:37,012 --> 01:02:39,717
Not Dawn again.

738
01:02:50,192 --> 01:02:52,433
It's Bruce.

739
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,643
What's he doing here?

740
01:03:12,172 --> 01:03:16,039
I suppose they're still learning.
That's why they keep moving about.

741
01:03:16,217 --> 01:03:18,969
- It's easy. I've done it.
- Who with?

742
01:03:19,137 --> 01:03:21,628
- Pauline.
- Liar.

743
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:24,673
Mummy keeps still
and Daddy moves on top of her.

744
01:03:24,851 --> 01:03:28,018
That's what they do when they know how.

745
01:03:32,525 --> 01:03:35,277
- That was some air raid.
- Air raid?

746
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:37,437
You didn't feel the house rock?

747
01:03:37,906 --> 01:03:40,776
You must have seen all those shell bursts.

748
01:03:44,913 --> 01:03:46,905
Let's get married.

749
01:03:47,248 --> 01:03:49,241
We can live in Montreal.

750
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:51,577
I could teach you French.

751
01:03:53,671 --> 01:03:57,669
Don't get smoochy. You'll spoil it.

752
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:03,257
We had a week, a whole wonderful week.

753
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:07,387
The most wonderful honeymoon
any couple ever had.

754
01:04:07,852 --> 01:04:11,186
- I love you so much.
- Goodbye, my darling.

755
01:04:11,356 --> 01:04:13,644
Promise you will be careful.

756
01:04:13,941 --> 01:04:18,687
- Chin up. There's a brave girl.
- If anything should happen to you...

757
01:04:31,793 --> 01:04:33,666
Andrew!

758
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,131
Andrew!

759
01:04:44,138 --> 01:04:46,712
She's outgrown this.
Can I change it for a bigger one?

760
01:04:46,891 --> 01:04:48,634
- Yes. Leave that one.
- Hello, Evelyn.

761
01:04:48,809 --> 01:04:51,016
- Oh, hello, Grace.
- All right.

762
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:56,146
God, how I hate all this
scrimping and squalor.

763
01:04:56,317 --> 01:04:59,816
I don't mind it.
It was harder before the war...

764
01:04:59,987 --> 01:05:01,944
...trying to keep up appearances.

765
01:05:02,114 --> 01:05:05,649
Now, well, it's patriotic to be poor.

766
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:09,735
Well, I'm looking for something
with a little oomph.

767
01:05:11,457 --> 01:05:15,870
- Don't you like it? What's wrong?
- I don't know how you cope.

768
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:20,754
Three kids, army pay, on your own...

769
01:05:21,592 --> 01:05:23,798
You know something, Molly?

770
01:05:23,969 --> 01:05:25,927
I like it on my own.

771
01:05:26,138 --> 01:05:27,763
It's true.

772
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:32,091
I never got used to sharing my bed.

773
01:05:32,603 --> 01:05:34,014
Not really.

774
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,887
I love a man in bed.

775
01:05:37,191 --> 01:05:38,899
The smell of him.

776
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:41,559
The hairiness rubbing against you.

777
01:05:42,154 --> 01:05:44,028
The weight of him.

778
01:05:44,323 --> 01:05:46,362
Then when they do it to you in the night...

779
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:50,827
...and you're not sure if you're
dreaming or if it's really happening.

780
01:05:50,996 --> 01:05:55,076
That's the best. No guilty feelings.

781
01:05:56,126 --> 01:05:59,329
Not that I should have any wide awake.

782
01:05:59,671 --> 01:06:01,581
Molly.

783
01:06:01,965 --> 01:06:03,508
Well...

784
01:06:03,675 --> 01:06:07,175
...I'm not talking about Mac.

785
01:06:07,805 --> 01:06:12,217
He hadn't touched me for ages,
and not often ever.

786
01:06:14,394 --> 01:06:17,810
My life started when he went on night work.

787
01:06:19,191 --> 01:06:21,397
You're having me on, Molly.

788
01:06:21,568 --> 01:06:23,442
Am I?

789
01:06:24,279 --> 01:06:27,529
- Look at this one. This is nice.
- Isn't that nice, yes.

790
01:06:29,701 --> 01:06:31,409
Sorry.

791
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:36,077
- That's nice.
- I saw it first.

792
01:06:36,249 --> 01:06:37,412
Give it to me.

793
01:06:37,584 --> 01:06:40,075
It's not fair. It's not fair.

794
01:06:40,754 --> 01:06:44,289
- I love pink.
- You're not developed enough for this.

795
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:46,838
Well, I am.

796
01:06:47,969 --> 01:06:50,342
Oh, look!

797
01:06:54,142 --> 01:06:56,680
How dare you do that?

798
01:07:22,712 --> 01:07:25,666
Oh, Mac, that was wonderful.

799
01:07:26,633 --> 01:07:30,713
- I haven't been to a concert since...
- Since I took you to the proms.

800
01:07:30,887 --> 01:07:32,927
That's right.

801
01:07:33,348 --> 01:07:35,387
Not since then.

802
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,174
Not since I got married.

803
01:07:45,693 --> 01:07:48,363
Shine more brightly...

804
01:07:48,571 --> 01:07:51,857
...than it does now.
- Her eyes don't close.

805
01:07:52,033 --> 01:07:54,239
Nor fortitude...

806
01:07:54,452 --> 01:07:56,694
...nor sacrifice...

807
01:07:56,996 --> 01:07:59,238
...nor sympathy...

808
01:07:59,874 --> 01:08:02,579
...nor neighbourly kindness.

809
01:08:03,002 --> 01:08:04,461
May God...

810
01:08:05,421 --> 01:08:07,248
...bless you...

811
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,798
...every...

812
01:08:10,718 --> 01:08:12,296
...one.

813
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:19,718
- He was a lot better this year.
- You say that every year, Dad.

814
01:08:19,936 --> 01:08:24,977
The land and the king are one, my son.
If he stutters, we falter.

815
01:08:25,441 --> 01:08:28,691
He's getting better. So are we.

816
01:09:22,456 --> 01:09:25,161
Dad's furious. It was "God Save the King."

817
01:09:32,633 --> 01:09:34,293
Come on, Billy.

818
01:09:34,468 --> 01:09:36,959
- Think.
- Come on. First word.

819
01:09:40,015 --> 01:09:41,807
- Choices.
- Second word.

820
01:09:41,976 --> 01:09:43,636
Second word.

821
01:09:43,811 --> 01:09:47,476
- What a lovely couple of tarts.
- Jam tart.

822
01:09:47,648 --> 01:09:49,641
Yeah!

823
01:09:50,276 --> 01:09:53,894
Time. Time for my annual toast.

824
01:09:54,071 --> 01:09:55,898
Charge your glasses.

825
01:09:56,115 --> 01:09:58,653
- Dadda, please. Come on, now.
- Oh, no. Don't, Dadda.

826
01:09:58,867 --> 01:10:01,904
To Mary MacDonald.

827
01:10:02,621 --> 01:10:05,741
- Thelma Richardson.
- Mama, please stay.

828
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:08,206
Bobo Hinds.

829
01:10:09,712 --> 01:10:12,463
- Lily Sanders.
- George, stop it now.

830
01:10:12,631 --> 01:10:15,087
This is my house.
I will not permit such behaviour.

831
01:10:15,426 --> 01:10:17,714
Little Sarah what's...?

832
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:20,011
There was spirit.

833
01:10:20,389 --> 01:10:24,173
- And Marjorie Anderson.
- That's enough, now. Sit down.

834
01:10:24,351 --> 01:10:26,640
And Henry Chapman's girl.

835
01:10:26,854 --> 01:10:28,431
Was it Thelma?

836
01:10:28,605 --> 01:10:29,934
No.

837
01:10:30,482 --> 01:10:33,317
I can see those cornflower eyes.

838
01:10:34,278 --> 01:10:36,354
I've lost your name, my sweetness.

839
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,902
Do we have to listen
to this nonsense every year?

840
01:10:39,074 --> 01:10:40,901
You're drunk, Dadda. Sit down.

841
01:10:41,785 --> 01:10:43,659
Betty Browning.

842
01:10:43,954 --> 01:10:46,824
Betty. Let me tell you something.

843
01:10:47,249 --> 01:10:49,740
I'm 73 years old.

844
01:10:49,918 --> 01:10:53,168
I've seen half the wonders of the world.

845
01:10:53,338 --> 01:10:56,672
And I've never laid eyes
on a finer sight...

846
01:10:56,842 --> 01:11:00,258
...than the curve
of Betty Browning's breasts.

847
01:11:02,723 --> 01:11:04,762
My girls...

848
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:08,302
...dead you may be, or old and withered...

849
01:11:08,478 --> 01:11:10,387
...but while I live...

850
01:11:10,564 --> 01:11:13,434
...I will do you honour to the last.

851
01:11:15,068 --> 01:11:16,562
Bless all of you.

852
01:11:18,613 --> 01:11:20,440
Bless all of you.

853
01:11:23,743 --> 01:11:25,617
It was Sheila, Grandpa.

854
01:11:26,997 --> 01:11:30,163
- What's that? What's that?
- Henry Chapman's daughter.

855
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:33,168
It was Sheila, I remember from last year.

856
01:11:33,336 --> 01:11:34,581
So it was.

857
01:11:34,879 --> 01:11:36,374
Sheila.

858
01:11:36,548 --> 01:11:39,632
Yeah, this boy will go far.

859
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:41,795
Yeah, Sheila.

860
01:11:44,389 --> 01:11:47,840
Something's wrong. What is it?

861
01:11:50,228 --> 01:11:52,137
We're not supposed to say.

862
01:11:52,313 --> 01:11:54,520
But we're being shipped out tomorrow.

863
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:56,019
- Where?
- I don't know.

864
01:11:56,192 --> 01:12:00,404
- You do. You're just not saying.
- I swear I don't know.

865
01:12:00,572 --> 01:12:02,897
Here's your Christmas present.

866
01:12:08,288 --> 01:12:10,743
You expect me to spend
the rest of the war...

867
01:12:10,915 --> 01:12:13,038
...sitting at home, staring at a ring.

868
01:12:13,209 --> 01:12:16,625
And you'll meet some French girl
who speaks your own language.

869
01:12:16,796 --> 01:12:19,252
Well, no, thank you.

870
01:12:29,892 --> 01:12:31,684
Please yourself.

871
01:12:41,487 --> 01:12:43,397
Mum!

872
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,732
- Prepare to lose.
- You got it.

873
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:50,860
- What is it, pet?
- For God's sake.

874
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:56,199
He's been posted.
And I was horrible to him.

875
01:12:58,254 --> 01:13:02,086
Don't leave it like that.
Go after him, Dawn.

876
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,707
Come on, now. Swallow your pride.

877
01:13:04,886 --> 01:13:06,629
What is it now?

878
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:30,618
We've missed them. They've gone.

879
01:13:32,038 --> 01:13:35,822
Can't you tell me where?
You can see I'm not a spy.

880
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:39,206
I would if I could, eh?

881
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:41,669
But I can't.

882
01:13:42,882 --> 01:13:45,799
- He'll write as soon as he can.
- Yeah, sure, he will.

883
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:47,504
You'll meet again.

884
01:13:47,678 --> 01:13:50,845
Don't know where Don't know when

885
01:13:51,015 --> 01:13:55,309
In the meantime, I'll be free tomorrow night

886
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:57,974
Come on.

887
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:00,641
Hey.

888
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,073
Bye, Dad.

889
01:14:12,286 --> 01:14:16,070
That letter this morning,
was it from Bruce?

890
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,700
What did he say?

891
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:22,537
He said I was right.
I shouldn't wait for him.

892
01:14:22,755 --> 01:14:25,672
It was better to make a clean break.

893
01:14:26,717 --> 01:14:30,168
Well, probably very sensible
under the circumstances.

894
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:33,097
Well, now he's gone and made me
fall in love with him.

895
01:14:33,265 --> 01:14:36,349
Which I never wanted to do.
I told him that.

896
01:14:41,482 --> 01:14:43,189
The ring!

897
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:47,359
I found the ring.

898
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:51,861
You needn't have bothered, Bill.

899
01:14:56,204 --> 01:14:57,782
Gotcha!

900
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:07,587
- You can run quite fast, Mum.
- When I first met your mother...

901
01:15:07,758 --> 01:15:10,794
- ...she could stand on her hands.
- Really?

902
01:15:11,762 --> 01:15:13,671
Perhaps I still can.

903
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:18,308
- Oh, stitch! It's ages since I have.
- You'll never know until you try.

904
01:15:18,477 --> 01:15:19,675
Yes.

905
01:15:19,853 --> 01:15:21,762
No, no, no.

906
01:15:24,065 --> 01:15:25,725
Good.

907
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:29,396
What's that?

908
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:31,860
Big Berthas shelling France.

909
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:34,867
Twenty-five-mile range they've got.

910
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:38,700
Send a few over every day
just to remind them we're still here.

911
01:15:39,247 --> 01:15:41,952
Each shell costs the price of a Ford Eight.

912
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:45,245
- Who pays for them?
- We will...

913
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,958
...you will, the rest of our lives.

914
01:15:49,507 --> 01:15:52,129
Remember this beach, Mac?

915
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:54,965
All those summers.

916
01:15:57,974 --> 01:16:01,224
Just the two families together.

917
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:05,514
Happy days, Grace.

918
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:09,104
Now there's just the two of us.

919
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:14,522
Thanks for today, Mac.

920
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:20,413
When you get bigger, Billy,
I'll teach you the googly.

921
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,825
Thanks.

922
01:16:38,306 --> 01:16:41,093
There goes another Ford Eight, Uncle Mac.

923
01:16:59,243 --> 01:17:02,197
Mac, did you ever find out
who Molly went off with?

924
01:17:02,371 --> 01:17:04,364
Ran off with a Polish pilot.

925
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:07,245
Sounds like one of those bad jokes
on the wireless.

926
01:17:09,253 --> 01:17:11,210
You miss her.

927
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:13,503
Well, I know I do.

928
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:17,753
She said, " I know you love me, Mac.

929
01:17:18,638 --> 01:17:20,796
But you never loved me enough."

930
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:25,507
Not loving enough.

931
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:28,724
It's a terrible thing to do to someone.

932
01:17:29,523 --> 01:17:32,524
I suppose I did it to Clive.

933
01:17:33,277 --> 01:17:36,611
I always held something back.

934
01:17:46,457 --> 01:17:48,663
All better left unsaid, Grace.

935
01:17:49,418 --> 01:17:52,419
You were never apart, you and Clive.

936
01:17:52,588 --> 01:17:55,506
He kept asking and asking.

937
01:17:56,092 --> 01:18:00,006
I kept waiting and waiting
for you to say something.

938
01:18:00,471 --> 01:18:02,547
But you never did.

939
01:18:02,807 --> 01:18:06,057
Clive had a job. I didn't.

940
01:18:06,227 --> 01:18:08,018
I couldn't.

941
01:18:12,816 --> 01:18:15,390
We did the decent thing, Grace.

942
01:18:16,153 --> 01:18:20,317
This war has put an end to decent things.

943
01:18:20,532 --> 01:18:22,821
We can't change what's past.

944
01:18:22,993 --> 01:18:25,152
Not even the war can do that.

945
01:18:25,329 --> 01:18:27,571
Oh, we did the proper thing.

946
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:29,948
But we lost love.

947
01:18:30,668 --> 01:18:32,744
And that's sad, Mac.

948
01:18:57,569 --> 01:19:00,060
Dawn! Dawn!

949
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,484
Dawn!

950
01:19:01,657 --> 01:19:03,317
- Mum?
- Grace.

951
01:19:03,534 --> 01:19:05,443
Oh, Mum!

952
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:09,157
Oh, thank God you're safe.

953
01:19:09,915 --> 01:19:11,706
Was that your house, madam?

954
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:16,789
- I didn't know there was an air raid.
- Oh, it wasn't a bomb. Just a fire.

955
01:19:16,964 --> 01:19:18,790
What? What do you mean, a fire?

956
01:19:18,966 --> 01:19:22,251
It happens in wartime as well, you know?

957
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:44,399
- Will my shrapnel melt?
- I shouldn't think so.

958
01:19:47,077 --> 01:19:49,864
I just wish I'd worn my nylons.

959
01:19:51,998 --> 01:19:55,414
- My ration books are in there.
- Grace! No, Grace!

960
01:19:55,585 --> 01:19:57,293
- Just a minute.
- Get out of my way.

961
01:19:57,462 --> 01:20:00,961
- I want my ration books.
- I don't want to lose you as well.

962
01:20:01,341 --> 01:20:03,464
Here, Grace. Take Sue.

963
01:20:03,635 --> 01:20:05,592
- Come on.
- Oh, so sad.

964
01:20:05,762 --> 01:20:07,221
Have you got somewhere to go?

965
01:20:07,389 --> 01:20:10,058
- It's all right. She's with me.
- Good.

966
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:20,318
- Hey, Roger, look.
- Good.

967
01:20:25,782 --> 01:20:26,980
Rubbish.

968
01:20:32,497 --> 01:20:35,581
Oh, look. A melted wireless.

969
01:20:42,549 --> 01:20:45,218
This is my house. What are you doing here?

970
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:52,219
Rohan...

971
01:20:52,642 --> 01:20:56,971
- Billy. Billy, stop that.
- You lot, out of there now.

972
01:20:59,524 --> 01:21:02,893
- Run.
- Billy. Billy, that's enough. Come on.

973
01:21:03,069 --> 01:21:05,062
That's enough, Bill.

974
01:21:07,865 --> 01:21:09,525
Run for it.

975
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:26,545
The sewing machine doesn't look too bad.

976
01:21:31,389 --> 01:21:34,176
All my lead soldiers have melted.

977
01:21:40,856 --> 01:21:43,941
Mac. Mac, well...

978
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:46,731
...some of the snaps are saved.

979
01:21:47,196 --> 01:21:49,070
Poor things.

980
01:21:54,537 --> 01:21:56,364
Grace.

981
01:21:56,539 --> 01:21:59,030
This coat should fit you.

982
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:02,043
And here's a few bits for the kitchen.

983
01:22:02,211 --> 01:22:05,627
- Thanks ever so much, Evelyn.
- Look, Mum.

984
01:22:05,798 --> 01:22:08,170
Here, Dawn. Try this.

985
01:22:09,093 --> 01:22:11,335
What's this, then?

986
01:22:11,804 --> 01:22:14,129
My lead soldiers.

987
01:22:23,816 --> 01:22:26,485
They're only things.

988
01:22:27,403 --> 01:22:30,154
We still have each other.

989
01:22:30,322 --> 01:22:33,109
I don't care about the house.

990
01:22:33,284 --> 01:22:36,238
I just hate all these people watching us.

991
01:22:36,412 --> 01:22:38,618
And being nice.

992
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,530
Coming!

993
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:46,458
Deliverance is at hand! All will be well!

994
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:14,404
Different world, eh, Billy?

995
01:23:14,575 --> 01:23:16,781
Not 20 miles from Piccadilly.

996
01:23:26,837 --> 01:23:30,253
Catch the line. Pull it in. Tie it up now.

997
01:23:30,799 --> 01:23:32,875
Are you strong enough for another shock?

998
01:23:33,051 --> 01:23:35,721
You're going to be a grandma.

999
01:23:35,887 --> 01:23:38,213
Hello, Grandma.

1000
01:23:38,515 --> 01:23:42,098
I don't believe this is happening to me.

1001
01:23:42,269 --> 01:23:45,887
It's only a house.
And a ghastly one at that.

1002
01:23:46,148 --> 01:23:49,018
They should all be burned and bombed
and the builder hanged.

1003
01:23:49,234 --> 01:23:53,148
What did I do to deserve this?

1004
01:23:53,363 --> 01:23:55,901
You married that fool, Clive. That's what.

1005
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:00,451
Never mind. Never mind.
You can stay with us.

1006
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:03,455
- How long?
- Three and a half months.

1007
01:24:03,623 --> 01:24:05,283
As long as that?

1008
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:07,166
Well, all right. Why not?

1009
01:24:07,335 --> 01:24:10,455
It's nearly summer.
Let the nippers run wild.

1010
01:24:16,928 --> 01:24:18,257
Bless you, Mac.

1011
01:24:21,224 --> 01:24:24,889
- What would I have done without you?
- You might still have a house.

1012
01:24:26,646 --> 01:24:29,220
I wish it all could have been different.

1013
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:35,402
Take care, Grace.

1014
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:50,870
Push off.

1015
01:24:51,588 --> 01:24:53,545
Jump in.

1016
01:24:53,715 --> 01:24:55,209
Well done, Billy.

1017
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:06,303
All I have left in the world
is in this little boat.

1018
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:08,517
Can I have a try?

1019
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:11,013
Put your hand on mine.

1020
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:13,148
Get the knack of it.

1021
01:25:18,865 --> 01:25:22,649
I shall teach you the ways of the river.

1022
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:28,203
Another year in that awful suburb
and you'd have been past saving.

1023
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:31,876
Look. They're coming this way.

1024
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:34,286
The future on the march.

1025
01:25:34,464 --> 01:25:38,757
I curse you, volt, watt and amp.

1026
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:19,756
Billy. Come here. Have a listen.

1027
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:22,381
See if you can hear anything.

1028
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,969
You're freezing cold.

1029
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:29,639
A shock like that
could give me a miscarriage.

1030
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,847
That's an idea. Do it again.

1031
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:34,849
Breakfast, all.

1032
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,569
- Morning, Grandma.
- Sleep well, darling?

1033
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:45,484
Yeah. Morning, Grandpa.

1034
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:51,953
Did they say how long it would take
to get the new ration books, Grace?

1035
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:53,867
About six weeks, I think.

1036
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:57,412
- How are we going to cope?
- Nettle soup.

1037
01:26:57,588 --> 01:27:01,004
Like we did in the Great War.
Very nourishing.

1038
01:27:01,175 --> 01:27:05,124
Bill and I will catch fish. The river fowl
will be laying eggs soon.

1039
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:07,759
We'll hunt, we'll forage, we'll overcome.

1040
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:10,304
And what about tea and sugar, clever Dick?

1041
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:13,430
Keep still. Nobody move.

1042
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:15,810
Mother, fetch my gun.

1043
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:53,883
- Blast the wily devil!
- Dadda, really.

1044
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,570
Never let a rat creep up on you, Bill.

1045
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:11,572
I think you hit him, Grandpa.

1046
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:16,824
He was limping when he ran off.

1047
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:31,132
I'm so sorry.

1048
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:52,486
Up, two, three. Throw the pole forward.

1049
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:57,406
Let it slide through your fingers.
Don't push until it hits the bottom.

1050
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:01,286
Such nice boys...

1051
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:04,296
...with straw boaters and blazers.

1052
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:08,877
And all the punts on the river lit up
with Chinese lanterns, like fireflies.

1053
01:29:09,093 --> 01:29:12,628
Up, two, three. Throw the pole forward.

1054
01:29:12,805 --> 01:29:17,763
Let it slide through your fingers.
Don't push until it hits the bottom.

1055
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:23,186
And the gramophone
going on one of the boats.

1056
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:25,059
Always the Charleston.

1057
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:27,904
- Charleston, Charleston - Charleston

1058
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:33,321
Oh, you girls.

1059
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:36,699
Wasn't it lovely?

1060
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:40,578
Now check that spinner.

1061
01:29:44,837 --> 01:29:46,296
No luck, Grandpa.

1062
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:49,415
Up, two, three.

1063
01:29:53,095 --> 01:29:57,556
Now you have a go, lad.
Put your might and main behind it.

1064
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:02,929
Hold it steady.

1065
01:30:03,856 --> 01:30:07,059
Now down with it. That's it.

1066
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:09,311
Now push.

1067
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:11,106
Sit up.

1068
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,400
Two, three, four.

1069
01:30:15,034 --> 01:30:16,943
He's getting better, isn't he?

1070
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:20,453
Let it slide through your fingers, lad.
Let it slide.

1071
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:27,332
Up, two, three. Come on, now.

1072
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:32,422
Let it slide through your fingers.
That's it. Now push, push.

1073
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:36,721
- It's stuck, Grandpa.
- Well, pull it out, lad. Pull it out.

1074
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:41,639
Pull it out, lad. Let it go.
Let it go. Stay put. Hang on.

1075
01:30:54,073 --> 01:30:55,816
Pull.

1076
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,366
Now, there's a lesson for life:

1077
01:31:00,537 --> 01:31:04,618
- Never give up the punt for the pole.
- Oh, Billy.

1078
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:17,672
Hello, my darlings.

1079
01:31:17,846 --> 01:31:18,925
Hello!

1080
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:24,057
- How are you?
- It's so lovely to see you.

1081
01:31:24,311 --> 01:31:26,304
I'm so excited.

1082
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:29,934
Wonderful things.

1083
01:31:32,361 --> 01:31:34,899
I was so worried.

1084
01:31:37,783 --> 01:31:40,784
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1085
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:48,998
She gets bigger and bigger.
What about Dawn?

1086
01:31:49,169 --> 01:31:52,953
No word from Bruce, my pet?
All men are beasts, darling.

1087
01:31:53,131 --> 01:31:56,547
- That's what I like about them.
- Say hello to your Dadda.

1088
01:31:56,718 --> 01:31:58,877
- Hello, Dadda.
- Charity.

1089
01:31:59,054 --> 01:32:01,806
- Hello, Dadda.
- Hope.

1090
01:32:01,973 --> 01:32:04,013
Afternoon, Faith.

1091
01:32:06,937 --> 01:32:09,309
All hens and no cocks.

1092
01:32:09,481 --> 01:32:12,398
Too many women in our family.

1093
01:32:12,567 --> 01:32:15,402
They're a different species from us, Bill.

1094
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:16,946
Don't you love them?

1095
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:19,901
Oh, yes, love them.
But don't try to understand them.

1096
01:32:20,075 --> 01:32:22,566
That road leads to ruin.

1097
01:32:23,328 --> 01:32:25,237
You said we could have a game of cricket.

1098
01:32:25,413 --> 01:32:26,991
So I did. Come on.

1099
01:32:27,165 --> 01:32:28,957
I bought this one.

1100
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:32,329
This one? But you look
so good in it yourself.

1101
01:32:32,504 --> 01:32:34,627
Look at the colour.

1102
01:32:34,923 --> 01:32:37,165
Do I want it?

1103
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:40,419
You look frustrated, Faithy.

1104
01:32:40,595 --> 01:32:43,513
That husband of yours
still can't rise to the occasion?

1105
01:32:43,723 --> 01:32:45,763
He's a menace. He ought to be locked up.

1106
01:32:45,934 --> 01:32:48,341
Don't let him get his claws
into Billy, Grace.

1107
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:50,644
I won't have their husbands here.

1108
01:32:50,814 --> 01:32:53,768
All four girls married duds,
including your mother.

1109
01:32:56,027 --> 01:32:59,728
They'll tame you if they can,
cage you and feed you titbits.

1110
01:33:00,949 --> 01:33:02,858
I bat first.

1111
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:08,154
- Come along, my dears. Tea's ready.
- Come on.

1112
01:33:08,998 --> 01:33:10,742
Middle and leg.

1113
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:44,366
- Six and out in the river, Grandpa.
- Certainly not.

1114
01:33:56,587 --> 01:33:58,379
Yes.

1115
01:33:58,548 --> 01:34:00,836
- That was a googly.
- I know.

1116
01:34:01,008 --> 01:34:04,543
You're a dark horse,
bowling googlies at your age.

1117
01:34:06,514 --> 01:34:08,423
Toss me up another.

1118
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,886
No, Grandpa. You're out. It's my turn.

1119
01:34:15,648 --> 01:34:18,020
A thousand curses.

1120
01:34:33,541 --> 01:34:35,201
Ready?

1121
01:34:49,849 --> 01:34:51,509
Two.

1122
01:34:56,438 --> 01:34:58,478
Four.

1123
01:34:59,233 --> 01:35:02,981
You want to know why they're called
Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?

1124
01:35:03,153 --> 01:35:04,945
Six. Why?

1125
01:35:05,406 --> 01:35:09,949
Your grandmother. She named them
after the virtues I lack. That's marriage.

1126
01:35:10,119 --> 01:35:11,317
Eight.

1127
01:35:11,787 --> 01:35:14,741
Eight? You're damned impossible, lad.

1128
01:35:15,082 --> 01:35:17,573
- Mummy, can I have the yellow cake?
- Yes, darling.

1129
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:20,918
Whatever you like, my darling.
It's so wonderful...

1130
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:23,840
...to have you all here.

1131
01:35:35,185 --> 01:35:37,427
Blast you. Damnation.

1132
01:35:39,481 --> 01:35:41,141
Two.

1133
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:43,477
Damn child.

1134
01:35:44,945 --> 01:35:46,439
Four.

1135
01:36:00,127 --> 01:36:02,796
Lost ball. Stop running.

1136
01:36:03,422 --> 01:36:05,580
It's only a game, Grandpa.

1137
01:36:06,675 --> 01:36:09,795
Six and out. Six and out.

1138
01:36:11,179 --> 01:36:13,468
Those clothes are really, really good.

1139
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:17,389
This is just like old times.

1140
01:36:47,966 --> 01:36:51,216
- Where's the fish?
- We got some eggs, Grandpa.

1141
01:36:51,386 --> 01:36:54,921
Never mind the eggs. Catch some fish.

1142
01:36:55,098 --> 01:36:58,265
Be off with you.
And don't come back empty-handed...

1143
01:36:58,435 --> 01:37:00,392
...or there's no supper.

1144
01:37:21,749 --> 01:37:23,292
Did you get a bite, Bill?

1145
01:37:23,459 --> 01:37:26,295
- No. Did you?
- No.

1146
01:37:58,578 --> 01:38:01,532
I'm scared to go back without any fish.

1147
01:38:01,706 --> 01:38:03,698
I hate Grandpa.

1148
01:38:16,512 --> 01:38:18,920
A stray bomber.

1149
01:38:19,098 --> 01:38:22,134
German. Must've lost his squadron.

1150
01:38:33,863 --> 01:38:36,947
Fish! Millions of them!

1151
01:38:50,755 --> 01:38:55,666
- This is going too far, young man.
- But you said, Grandpa.

1152
01:38:55,843 --> 01:39:01,679
Well, I... I'll concede I was insistent.
But how the devil...?

1153
01:39:01,849 --> 01:39:05,681
- Dadda, it's wonderful.
- It looks a bit fishy to me.

1154
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,391
Could we salt them or smoke them,
do you think?

1155
01:39:09,565 --> 01:39:12,519
It's like the feeding of the 5000.
It's a miracle.

1156
01:39:12,693 --> 01:39:15,480
Well, so it's miracles now, is it?

1157
01:39:15,654 --> 01:39:17,777
They'll stink the place up by morning.

1158
01:39:17,948 --> 01:39:21,400
Why don't you invite all your friends
round for supper, Grandpa?

1159
01:39:21,577 --> 01:39:24,578
I have no friends. Only relations.

1160
01:39:24,747 --> 01:39:26,205
Oh, Dadda.

1161
01:39:33,547 --> 01:39:35,006
Dawn!

1162
01:39:36,675 --> 01:39:39,000
Dawn! It's me.

1163
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:43,219
Just ignore him.

1164
01:39:44,099 --> 01:39:45,807
Bill!

1165
01:39:47,978 --> 01:39:49,686
Bill.

1166
01:39:49,897 --> 01:39:53,348
Bill, will you bring that canoe over here?

1167
01:39:53,525 --> 01:39:57,060
Keep going, Billy. Stick to this bank.

1168
01:40:00,449 --> 01:40:02,323
Come on!

1169
01:40:04,202 --> 01:40:06,694
Will you give me a chance to explain?

1170
01:40:09,374 --> 01:40:11,996
Faster, Billy. Faster.

1171
01:40:18,216 --> 01:40:20,043
Dawn.

1172
01:40:20,218 --> 01:40:21,761
Susie.

1173
01:40:23,930 --> 01:40:25,970
I'm going to kill you, Sue Rohan.

1174
01:40:36,067 --> 01:40:37,645
Dawn.

1175
01:40:39,946 --> 01:40:43,113
I couldn't write. It was secret posting.

1176
01:40:43,283 --> 01:40:45,192
I came as soon as I heard about the baby.

1177
01:40:45,368 --> 01:40:47,242
Go away!

1178
01:40:48,163 --> 01:40:51,662
I've deserted. I went AWOL to be with you.

1179
01:40:51,833 --> 01:40:53,956
I hate you!

1180
01:40:55,921 --> 01:40:57,415
Bruce! Bruce!

1181
01:40:58,089 --> 01:40:59,500
Bruce!

1182
01:40:59,674 --> 01:41:02,165
Bruce, Bruce. What have I done?

1183
01:41:03,637 --> 01:41:06,128
Nobody can hold their breath that long.

1184
01:41:06,681 --> 01:41:08,259
No.

1185
01:41:08,433 --> 01:41:09,975
Bruce!

1186
01:41:16,191 --> 01:41:19,026
Oh, I missed you. I missed you so much.

1187
01:41:19,402 --> 01:41:21,311
I missed you, baby.

1188
01:41:28,119 --> 01:41:29,578
Be careful.

1189
01:41:29,746 --> 01:41:31,822
So glad you could come.

1190
01:41:31,998 --> 01:41:34,571
Here we are. All together again.

1191
01:41:34,751 --> 01:41:38,879
- Happy as can be in the old groove.
- You're gonna be a grandfather, eh?

1192
01:41:39,047 --> 01:41:40,920
And I'm still just a lad myself.

1193
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:43,249
Don't bother to grow up.
It's no fun at all.

1194
01:41:43,426 --> 01:41:47,293
You know, I believe
Elsie Drinkwater's buried here.

1195
01:41:47,472 --> 01:41:49,049
That trollop.

1196
01:41:49,349 --> 01:41:51,555
- Here, Billy.
- Take a snap now. Quick, quick.

1197
01:41:51,726 --> 01:41:54,134
All right, line up for
a photograph, everybody.

1198
01:41:54,312 --> 01:41:57,597
Smallest in the front.
Come on. Quick, quick.

1199
01:41:57,774 --> 01:42:00,395
- All right.
- Just a couple snaps.

1200
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:02,603
Smile.

1201
01:42:04,364 --> 01:42:07,068
- Crank it forward, crank it forward.
- Quickly.

1202
01:42:12,246 --> 01:42:15,200
- Break it up.
- Bruce.

1203
01:42:15,374 --> 01:42:17,166
- Bye-bye, Bruce.
- Be brave.

1204
01:42:17,335 --> 01:42:19,956
- Bye.
- Don't worry, now.

1205
01:42:20,421 --> 01:42:22,295
Keep smiling.

1206
01:42:34,769 --> 01:42:36,678
Left. Left.

1207
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:39,438
- Bye.
- Bye.

1208
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:44,400
Come on, boys. Left, left.

1209
01:43:06,509 --> 01:43:09,712
"What can you do with
four daughters," I asked myself.

1210
01:43:09,887 --> 01:43:11,547
Four daughters.

1211
01:43:11,722 --> 01:43:15,221
A string quartet was all
I could come up with.

1212
01:43:15,392 --> 01:43:19,058
And they hated me for making them learn.

1213
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:22,599
And now we're glad you did.

1214
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:25,102
Here's to music.

1215
01:43:25,277 --> 01:43:26,855
And absent friends.

1216
01:43:27,029 --> 01:43:30,279
- And absent bridegrooms.
- And...

1217
01:43:30,783 --> 01:43:31,945
...the bride.

1218
01:43:32,117 --> 01:43:34,525
- The bride.
- The bride.

1219
01:43:35,788 --> 01:43:37,531
And... Wait for it.

1220
01:43:37,706 --> 01:43:39,913
Here's to my CO.

1221
01:43:40,084 --> 01:43:42,871
He's wangled me a posting close to home.

1222
01:43:43,045 --> 01:43:47,292
He said, "Your house burns down,
your daughter gets married...

1223
01:43:47,466 --> 01:43:49,957
...you're always away
on compassionate leave.

1224
01:43:50,135 --> 01:43:52,044
Pack up your typewriter...

1225
01:43:52,221 --> 01:43:55,720
...fight the bloody war down there."

1226
01:43:56,266 --> 01:43:58,176
Clive.

1227
01:43:58,352 --> 01:44:01,851
I found this little bungalow
to rent down the towpath.

1228
01:44:02,022 --> 01:44:04,145
I never want to leave the river again.

1229
01:44:04,316 --> 01:44:08,100
The children had such a wonderful summer.

1230
01:44:08,278 --> 01:44:09,856
Fair enough.

1231
01:44:10,030 --> 01:44:11,061
The river.

1232
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:13,731
- The river.
- The river.

1233
01:44:14,326 --> 01:44:16,532
And loyal friends.

1234
01:44:17,788 --> 01:44:21,655
And good and faithful wives.

1235
01:44:21,833 --> 01:44:24,834
We hope and trust.

1236
01:44:25,128 --> 01:44:27,584
And grumpy grandfathers.

1237
01:44:27,756 --> 01:44:32,133
Since you're shortly to join our ranks,
I throw down the gauntlet.

1238
01:44:32,302 --> 01:44:35,636
A cricket match.
You and Mac against Bill and me.

1239
01:44:35,847 --> 01:44:37,390
On?

1240
01:44:42,979 --> 01:44:45,435
You know, Mac played for Surrey seconds.

1241
01:44:45,607 --> 01:44:47,600
And I opened for the Indian Army.

1242
01:44:47,776 --> 01:44:52,023
- We've heard that a thousand times.
- Class will tell.

1243
01:44:52,197 --> 01:44:56,859
It's an olive branch. Take it.
It's the best he can do. Come on.

1244
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:02,454
- We're putting you in to bat first.
- I always get the staccato wrong.

1245
01:45:02,624 --> 01:45:04,202
- No, it was me.
- No, it was me.

1246
01:45:04,376 --> 01:45:07,045
- All right, it was you.
- She's not feeling too good.

1247
01:45:07,212 --> 01:45:09,370
- Darling. Come and lie down.
- Poor thing.

1248
01:45:17,013 --> 01:45:18,757
Fine delivery, Billy.

1249
01:45:18,932 --> 01:45:22,597
It was a good length. Turned a bit too.

1250
01:45:23,895 --> 01:45:26,766
- He'll make a good player.
- Give him the you-know-what.

1251
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:28,849
All right, Grandpa.

1252
01:45:38,535 --> 01:45:40,942
- That was a googly!
- A googly?

1253
01:45:41,121 --> 01:45:43,790
You didn't spot it, Clive.

1254
01:45:44,165 --> 01:45:47,617
I taught him how.
And now he turns it against me.

1255
01:45:47,836 --> 01:45:51,169
The law of life. Cruel, isn't it?

1256
01:45:51,381 --> 01:45:54,500
- You wicked old devil.
- Well done, lad.

1257
01:45:55,885 --> 01:45:58,886
- I'm proud of you.
- Clive.

1258
01:45:59,681 --> 01:46:02,350
- Quickly, Clive!
- What's up?

1259
01:46:03,184 --> 01:46:04,844
- Hurry up!
- All right. We're coming.

1260
01:46:05,019 --> 01:46:07,724
Don't panic. Clive!

1261
01:46:09,357 --> 01:46:12,109
- What is it?
- Clive, fetch the doctor.

1262
01:46:12,276 --> 01:46:14,518
- Are you ill?
- Not me. Dawn.

1263
01:46:14,696 --> 01:46:17,151
She's in labour.

1264
01:46:17,323 --> 01:46:20,324
- Hot water. Lots of hot water.
- What for?

1265
01:46:20,493 --> 01:46:22,984
I don't know. They always say that
in the pictures.

1266
01:46:23,162 --> 01:46:24,787
Hurry.

1267
01:46:33,756 --> 01:46:35,085
- Breathe deeply.
- Yes, push.

1268
01:46:35,258 --> 01:46:37,962
Why? It's coming on its own.

1269
01:46:44,892 --> 01:46:46,968
It doesn't hurt.

1270
01:46:47,228 --> 01:46:51,178
- Home Doctor. It's all here. Childbirth...
- Oh, go away, Dadda.

1271
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:54,228
There it is.

1272
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:58,146
It's all sticky.

1273
01:46:58,322 --> 01:47:00,231
There it is.

1274
01:47:00,491 --> 01:47:02,614
It's a little boy.

1275
01:47:03,869 --> 01:47:05,779
It's a little boy.

1276
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:17,203
Get out of it!

1277
01:47:18,592 --> 01:47:20,502
Go around the other way!

1278
01:47:25,224 --> 01:47:28,640
Go on, get him! Go on, get him!

1279
01:47:42,575 --> 01:47:45,244
Now, this is not the end.

1280
01:47:45,411 --> 01:47:47,949
It is not even the beginning...

1281
01:47:48,122 --> 01:47:49,746
...of the end.

1282
01:47:49,915 --> 01:47:53,035
But it is perhaps the end of the beginning.

1283
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:55,748
I scrumped it. I nearly got caught.

1284
01:47:55,921 --> 01:47:58,044
They chased me for ages.

1285
01:47:58,215 --> 01:48:00,208
Oh, you did that for me?

1286
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:03,171
And on the last day of your holidays.

1287
01:48:03,345 --> 01:48:06,548
Well, for the baby, really.

1288
01:48:06,723 --> 01:48:09,641
Well, thank you, Billy.
From the baby and me.

1289
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:12,930
You're not that bad really, are you, Billy?

1290
01:48:22,906 --> 01:48:26,406
Oh, you miserable little tripehound.

1291
01:48:26,577 --> 01:48:28,237
I'm the one who should be fed up...

1292
01:48:28,412 --> 01:48:31,448
...sacrificing my last sup
of black-market petrol...

1293
01:48:31,623 --> 01:48:32,999
...to take you to school.

1294
01:48:33,166 --> 01:48:35,455
I've gotta live in Rosehill Avenue as well.

1295
01:48:35,627 --> 01:48:38,462
Only till they get you
into the local school.

1296
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:40,587
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.

1297
01:48:40,757 --> 01:48:43,544
You'll be home for the weekends.
Now shut up...

1298
01:48:43,719 --> 01:48:45,510
...or walk.

1299
01:48:49,016 --> 01:48:53,345
Great, strapping fellows playing
silly buggers with a war on.

1300
01:48:53,770 --> 01:48:55,644
Outrageous.

1301
01:49:19,921 --> 01:49:23,504
All you do is knock the sense
out of them and...

1302
01:49:23,675 --> 01:49:27,507
And... And fill them up with muck!

1303
01:49:42,318 --> 01:49:44,311
Where are you going?

1304
01:49:44,654 --> 01:49:46,314
Oh, my God.

1305
01:49:46,489 --> 01:49:48,565
Not my school!

1306
01:49:51,786 --> 01:49:54,823
- Rohan! Rohan, hey!
- This is anarchy!

1307
01:49:55,832 --> 01:49:57,824
It was a stray bomb.

1308
01:49:58,001 --> 01:50:02,710
- Thank you, Adolf.
- The school has been destroyed!

1309
01:50:03,173 --> 01:50:07,502
Teachers, keep them away
from that fire. Teachers, fall in!

1310
01:50:08,052 --> 01:50:10,590
Get them into their lines!

1311
01:50:11,014 --> 01:50:14,513
Where's your discipline?
You'll all be punished!

1312
01:50:17,604 --> 01:50:21,186
This is war!
And it's not a laughing matter!

1313
01:50:21,357 --> 01:50:23,231
Get them into their lines!

1314
01:50:25,737 --> 01:50:28,987
Will you get into your lines!
Who threw that at that teacher?

1315
01:50:29,157 --> 01:50:31,730
Who threw that box? You, stop it!

1316
01:50:31,909 --> 01:50:34,317
You'll regret this.

1317
01:50:35,163 --> 01:50:37,369
Grandpa!

1318
01:50:40,835 --> 01:50:43,587
Get out. Stop that!

1319
01:50:58,561 --> 01:51:00,850
In all my life, nothing
ever quite matched...

1320
01:51:01,022 --> 01:51:03,228
...the perfect joy of that moment.

1321
01:51:03,399 --> 01:51:05,226
My school lay in ruins...

1322
01:51:05,401 --> 01:51:09,233
...and the river beckoned
with the promise of stolen days.
