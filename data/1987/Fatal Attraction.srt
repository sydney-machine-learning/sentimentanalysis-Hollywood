1
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,800
<i>Mom, there is one thing
I'd like to ask you.</i>

2
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,542
<i>- Sure.
- How do they make that slime</i>

3
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,836
<i>- they're always dumping on you?
- Oh, well.</i>

4
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,713
<i>First they take some water.
Some liquid.</i>

5
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,633
<i>And then they add some
JELL-O powder and some flour.</i>

6
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,759
<i>Sometimes some soap.</i>

7
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,511
<i>Then they dump it all over me.</i>

8
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,971
You gotta get going, kiddo.
We're going to be late.

9
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,514
<i>Where do they dump it from?</i>

10
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:22,017
<i>Actually, Vanessa, I've always
wondered that, too. I just don't know.</i>

11
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,108
<i>Very interesting. Is it always green?</i>

12
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,444
<i>Well, yeah, it usually is,
but I guess it could be red.</i>

13
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,451
<i>Or it could be blue.</i>

14
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,422
<i>Or yellow.</i>

15
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,343
- Daddy, telephone.
- Thanks, darling.

16
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,690
Hello?

17
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,194
Hi. No, I'm fine. I just stubbed my toe.

18
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,114
Hang on one second, will you?
Honey, it's Hildy.

19
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,033
I'll call her back.

20
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,202
She's in the bathroom.

21
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,038
She wants to know what you're wearing.

22
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,706
My black suit.

23
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,626
She's gonna wear her black dress.

24
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,671
Well, it's gonna be business.
You know how those things are.

25
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,717
Ellen, I don't want you messing with
my make-up now, honey, okay? I'm late.

26
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,803
- Is her red dress okay?
- It's perfect.

27
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:44,058
Did you hear that? You got it.
Okay, darling, see you later. Bye.

28
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,726
Oh, man.

29
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,481
I told you a million times
not to play with my lipstick, right?

30
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,735
So when are you gonna
listen to me, huh? Silly girl.

31
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,407
Honey, where's my blue suit?

32
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,243
It's on the back of the door.

33
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,915
Oh, shit!

34
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,210
Shit, shit, shit!

35
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,587
Shit, shit, shit.

36
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,257
Shit, shit, shit.

37
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,431
- Hi, Ellen.
- Hi, Christine.

38
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,933
- How are you doing?
- Good.

39
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,520
- Where's Mommy?
- Mom? She's in the bathroom.

40
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,272
Ellen, I got you a present.

41
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:34,275
- You want to see what it is?
- Yeah, yeah.

42
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,527
Do you like it?

43
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,238
Okay. Come on, let's go find Mommy.

44
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,950
So then she's taking me to have...

45
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,286
She's pregnant,
she's going to give birth.

46
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,173
Hiya, Chuck. How are you? Good to
see you. You gonna make it Friday?

47
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,259
- Friday, I'm there.
- We need you, pal. We're in the cellar.

48
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,677
- You know that. Okay.
- Okay.

49
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,970
Dan, is my hair okay?

50
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,180
- You look great.
- I'm serious.

51
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,516
You're the prettiest woman
in the room, sweetheart.

52
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,726
You liar.

53
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,853
Dan! Danny!

54
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,484
- Hiya, Bob. How are you?
- Glad you could make it, Dan.

55
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,986
Listen, I'm sorry
about the meeting tomorrow.

56
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,488
I know it's a Saturday,
but we've got a real crisis here.

57
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,449
Oh, no, I understand.
You know my wife Beth? Bob Drimmer.

58
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,326
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

59
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:28,078
- I hope you like sushi.
- Thank you. I love it, Bob. Love it.

60
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,873
- What did he do to his neck?
- He was screwing his wife.

61
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,374
- Are you serious?
- Am I serious?

62
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,419
Absolutely, you should see his wife.
They had to take her out on a stretcher.

63
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,963
- Hi, darling.
- You guys are bad.

64
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,299
Who wants champagne? Champagne?
Let's go.

65
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,343
- Champagne for everyone.
- Hemlock! With a twist.

66
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,429
Four champagnes over here.
Excuse me. Hi.

67
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,267
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

68
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,811
- Thank you very much.
- Excuse me.

69
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,857
Jesus! Thank you. Fuck.

70
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,152
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

71
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,738
So, what great cultural event
are we here to celebrate tonight?

72
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,824
- Some exercise manual.
- Not another one?

73
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,868
This one's different.

74
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,579
Based on ancient samurai discipline.

75
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:17,336
Danny, look at this guy nod.
What is that, part of the ritual?

76
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,587
Hey...

77
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,049
Hi, there.

78
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,598
- Jesus, if looks could kill...
- Glad to see you haven't lost your touch.

79
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,164
- I think she likes me.
- You do, huh?

80
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,102
- I think she wants me.
- I think you're batting zero for two,

81
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,269
and I don't want to know you.

82
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,772
- She was undressing me with her eyes.
- You think so? Good luck, pal.

83
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,941
She had trouble with the buttons.

84
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,611
A signed COPY-

85
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,749
- Here you are, ma'am.
- Oh, thank you, dear.

86
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,422
- Can I get a champagne, please?
- You got it.

87
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,389
I'm not saying anything.
I'm not even gonna look.

88
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,890
Was it that bad?

89
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,560
Let's just say I was glad I wasn't
on the receiving end of that one.

90
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:15,936
Cheers.

91
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,814
Just gotta hate it when guys think
they can come on like that.

92
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,026
Jimmy's okay. He's just a little
insecure, like the rest of us.

93
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,324
- My name is Dan Gallagher.
- Alex Forrest.

94
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,743
Nice to meet you.
What is your connection here?

95
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,621
I'm an editor at Robbins & Hart.
And you?

96
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:38,167
I'm with Miller, Goodman and Hurst.
I do all your legal work.

97
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,377
I haven't seen you
around their office, though.

98
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,464
I've just been with them
a couple of weeks.

99
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,806
I have to go.

100
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,017
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah.

101
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,269
Better run along.

102
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,646
It was very nice to meet you.

103
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,112
"Make concessions with your body."

104
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,281
What does this mean,
"make concessions"?

105
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,005
- Oh, give me a break.
- Give you a break?

106
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,910
What does this mean?

107
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,412
How many did you buy?

108
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,007
- Well, thanks again, Christine.
- Any time, Mrs. Gallagher.

109
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,509
Good night.

110
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,770
Aren't you forgetting something?

111
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,033
Quincy, let's hit it, pal.

112
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,377
You're such a good boy, yes.

113
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,841
You did such good business.
You did good business.

114
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,802
You're the best boy.

115
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,345
Good night.

116
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,897
It's just for tonight, honey.

117
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,361
When you first see the house,
don't show any interest at all,

118
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,614
- otherwise we can't negotiate.
- Will you stop worrying about it?

119
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,575
- Ellen, are you chewing gum again?
- What's to worry, though?

120
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,995
- We can't afford it anymore.
- Daddy, is Granny going to be there?

121
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,621
- Just up the road from Mom and Dad.
- Yes.

122
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,791
- Which is another reason not to buy it.
- I didn't hear that.

123
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,960
What's to worry about?
Can't afford the goddamn thing, anyway.

124
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,796
Oh, come on. Hold on to him, honey.

125
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,802
Let's just not worry about it, okay?
I haven't even seen the damn place yet.

126
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,887
I may not even like it.

127
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,433
Ellen? The gum? Thank you.

128
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,021
Come on, Quincy. Come on, boy.

129
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,858
No, honey. Quincy's got to stay here
with Daddy. Daddy's gonna be all alone.

130
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,502
Sorry, Quincy. Now, you're not gonna
forget to walk him, are you?

131
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,987
- I promise.
- You promise.

132
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,281
Okay. You have a good meeting.

133
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,075
- Okay. See you tomorrow night.
- Love you.

134
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:42,601
Two times down, third time up,
he looked like a jellyfish.

135
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,314
- Hi, Bob.
- Hi, Dan. Sorry to ruin your weekend.

136
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,107
Please, give my apologies
to your lovely wife.

137
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,360
- David, hi.
- Help yourself.

138
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,821
- So, how are you feeling?
- Don't ask.

139
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:58,325
Henry's out of town, so I asked
Alex Forrest to stand in for him.

140
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,536
- Anybody know where she is?
- She's on her way.

141
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,372
Well, since we've got a little time,

142
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,501
maybe you can tell us exactly
what happened to your neck, Bob.

143
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,962
That's cute. Very cute.

144
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,173
Sorry I'm late. I was getting the file.

145
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,509
Dan, this is Alex Forrest,
our new associate editor.

146
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,427
- We've met before. Hi.
- Yeah, hello.

147
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:21,348
- Okay. Can we get started, Dan?
- Okay, here's the story.

148
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,976
You want to publish a novel
in which one of the characters

149
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,313
is a senator from New Jersey
who's fooling around.

150
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,190
Now, there's a certain congressman
from Ohio

151
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,942
who claims
the character's based upon him,

152
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,403
and he's filed an injunction
against the publication.

153
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,197
Look, the congressman's bald.
This guy has hair.

154
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,074
They're from different states,
for Christ's sake.

155
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,701
Look, if we don't sell those books,
we're screwed.

156
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,994
Well, that's all fine, but if I'm
gonna go to court to prove

157
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,788
the senator's not based upon
this congressman,

158
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,332
then I have to know the truth.

159
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:52,045
Now... Well, strictly between
these walls, all right?

160
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,049
Did the author have an affair
with Mr. Ohio or not?

161
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,014
Yeah, she did.

162
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,977
But she also had a lot of affairs
with other politicians.

163
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,479
Any one of them could
make the same claim.

164
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,567
She swears this character's fictitious.
I just got off the phone with her.

165
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,152
And you believe her?

166
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,405
Yeah, I believe her.

167
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,324
Okay, now that we've got that
on the table,

168
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,160
what can we do to lift that injunction?

169
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,413
If we believe the girl, is there some way
we can get to the congressman?

170
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,248
They take campaign contributions.

171
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,500
Can we buy him off?
Can we frighten him off?

172
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,253
Is there something in his past
that we can find out about?

173
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,756
I mean, we need to use some leverage.
I got 25...

174
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,272
Give me a break, will you?

175
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,735
Come on.

176
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,531
Come on!

177
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,617
Come on.

178
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,379
- Was it made in Taiwan?
- Yeah. These are tough to find.

179
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,799
Wait, wait. Here. We got one.

180
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,427
Come on!

181
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,224
What do you say, you want to
go get a drink till it stops?

182
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,476
- Yeah, I'd love it.
- Okay.

183
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,061
Come on.

184
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,485
The strangest case I ever handled?

185
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,405
Well, the truth was,
I never actually handled a case.

186
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,908
The strangest case I ever came near to

187
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,327
was when my parents got divorced.

188
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,080
And my mother asked me
to represent her.

189
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,749
- You're kidding?
- That's what I said.

190
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,633
"What do you mean?" she told me.
"You know what an asshole the guy is."

191
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,421
"You've been a witness to this marriage
for the past 29 years."

192
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,006
Can you believe this?
This is coming from my mother.

193
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,467
No. How did you get out of it?

194
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,345
Well, you can't exactly
turn your mother down.

195
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,682
So, I escaped on a technicality.

196
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,977
- Which was what?
- I didn't practice family law.

197
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,189
And it was true, you know.
And she bought it.

198
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,110
- You're making this up.
- Could I make something up like that?

199
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,113
Waiter?

200
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,451
I've got a lot of pull here, you know.
My favorite restaurant.

201
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:32,038
- Yeah, I noticed.
- They know me well. Miss?

202
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,986
- You want coffee?
- I'd love one.

203
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,459
Can we have two coffees, please?

204
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,463
Well, I tell you, it's a...

205
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,008
- Do you want one?
- No, thank you.

206
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,304
It's funny being a lawyer, you know.
It's like being a doctor.

207
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,472
Everybody's telling you
their innermost secrets.

208
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,891
Oh, God.

209
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,728
- You must have to be discreet.
- Oh, God, yeah.

210
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,855
Are you?

211
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,484
Am I what?

212
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,070
Discreet.

213
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,330
Yes, I'm discreet.

214
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,166
Me, too.

215
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,425
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

216
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,511
Why don't you have a date tonight?
It's Saturday night.

217
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,180
I did have a date.

218
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,433
I stood him up.
That was the phone call I made.

219
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,563
Does that make you feel good?

220
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,942
It doesn't make me feel bad.

221
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,904
So, where's your wife?

222
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,448
Where's my wife?

223
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:55,455
My wife is in the country with her
parents, visiting them for the weekend.

224
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,709
And you're here with a strange girl,
being a naughty boy.

225
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,254
I don't think having dinner
with anybody is a crime.

226
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,756
Not yet.

227
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,971
- Will it be?
- I don't know. What do you think?

228
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,265
I definitely think
it's going to be up to you.

229
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,106
I can't say yet.
I haven't made up my mind.

230
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,988
At least you're very honest.

231
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:34,494
We were attracted to each other
at the party. That was obvious.

232
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:39,582
You're on your own for the night.
That's also obvious.

233
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,922
We're two adults.

234
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,056
Let's get the check.

235
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:44,999
- Oh, that was great.
- Oh, thank God. Thank God.

236
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,299
Are you feeling energetic?

237
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,679
What do you have in mind?

238
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,815
- How you getting home?
- I don't know, I live upstairs.

239
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,693
- This is the building?
- Yeah.

240
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,493
Well, where do I get a cab, you know?

241
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,173
Have you ever done it in an elevator?

242
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,009
- Not recently, no.
- I bet you haven't.

243
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,167
Oh, I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

244
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,878
How are you?

245
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,222
<i>Hi. What happened to you?</i>

246
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:31,351
<i>I tried you earlier. I'm gonna go...
I guess you're not back yet.</i>

247
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:35,688
<i>Well, I'm gonna go to bed now,
so call me in the morning. Bye-bye.</i>

248
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,919
Hello? Oh, Dan, darling,
we were expecting you.

249
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,463
<i>- I'm sorry. I had work to do.</i>
- That's a pity.

250
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,590
We really wanted you to see that house.

251
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,467
<i>- Well, I'll see it next time.</i>
- Yes, of course.

252
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,635
You want to speak to Beth?

253
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,304
- Yes, please.
<i>- Yes, all right.</i>

254
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:14,310
The phone, it's Dan. Here you are.

255
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,148
Well, hello. What happened to you?

256
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,692
Hi...

257
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,779
Nothing. I just went out
and had dinner with Bill last night.

258
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,239
How is he?

259
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:32,078
He's... Bill's, you know...
Bill's Bill, the same as usual.

260
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,663
<i>Is he still with that girl?</i>

261
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,958
Well, he wasn't last night.
I think it's over.

262
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,919
He really didn't seem like
he wanted to talk about it.

263
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,548
- So, are you getting any work done?
<i>- Yeah, I'm working.</i>

264
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,092
Oh, listen, there's some of the spaghetti
sauce in the refrigerator,

265
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,593
if you get hungry.

266
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,096
Great. Okay. How's Ellen doing?

267
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:54,350
She is having the best time.
I just hope that Dad survives it.

268
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,061
Honey, I don't know how to tell you this.

269
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:00,940
But... She wants a rabbit.

270
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,984
<i>Beth, no rabbits.</i>

271
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,237
Jesus Christ! This goddamn family's
turning into Noah's Ark.

272
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,991
I mean, please! Give her a kiss,
all right? But no promises.

273
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,368
- All right.
<i>- When are you coming home?</i>

274
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,328
- Well, it's getting complicated.
<i>- Why's that?</i>

275
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,497
There's a problem with the house.

276
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,124
They sold it.

277
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:23,087
Very funny. No. We can't get in to see it
until late this afternoon.

278
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:26,757
I'm not up to fighting the traffic.
I thought I would come in tomorrow.

279
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,217
What about school?

280
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:31,971
She's only 5 years old.
What's she gonna miss? Trigonometry?

281
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,389
Yeah, okay. All right.

282
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,641
Well, then I'll see you
when I get home from work.

283
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,935
Okay. See you tomorrow.

284
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,563
Okay, thanks. Have a good time.

285
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,697
Yeah?

286
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:53,493
What happened? I woke up.
You weren't here. I hate that.

287
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,002
- You didn't get my note?
<i>- What note?</i>

288
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,672
I left you a note right by your bed.

289
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,427
Oh.

290
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:21,229
That's nice. I thought we were going
to spend the day together.

291
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,941
Alex, look, I've got so much work
to do today. I can't.

292
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,985
<i>Why don't you just come over?
I'll cook us lunch.</i>

293
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,195
I got to take the dog for a walk.

294
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,113
The poor dog has not
been out of this house all day.

295
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,406
<i>I got to take him out.</i>

296
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:36,577
Well, bring the dog. I love animals.
I'm a great cook. Come on.

297
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,581
Listen, I'd love to, but I can't.
All right? I really can't.

298
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,251
<i>Do what you have to do,
then come over afterwards.</i>

299
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,378
<i>We can always eat late.</i>

300
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:52,426
Or you can work here.
I won't disturb you, I promise.

301
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,887
I'll be a good girl.

302
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,269
Yeah, you don't give up, do you?
You just don't give up.

303
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,443
Come on!

304
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,077
Come on!

305
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,999
Quincy, no! Quincy!

306
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,919
I got it! I got it! He's free!

307
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:31,757
Quincy, cover me. I'm on it.
Go deep. He fires. Throws...

308
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:35,177
- Okay.
- She's got it. Yes. It's back.

309
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,847
Over the head. He's got it.

310
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,857
Dan? Dan!

311
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,779
Dan? Dan, can you hear me?

312
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,115
Oh, my God!

313
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,875
- You bastard.
- Your face!

314
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,460
Your face!

315
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:11,339
- That was a shitty thing to do.
- I'm sorry. I was just fooling around.

316
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,966
My father died of a heart attack.

317
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:19,472
I was 7 years old.
It happened right in front of me.

318
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,643
Honey, I'm sorry.

319
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:28,564
Really, I had no idea. If I did, I never
would have done anything like that.

320
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,237
Wait, he didn't die? He's alive?

321
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,241
Yeah, he's alive and well
and living in Phoenix.

322
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:45,498
I guess you certainly got me, didn't you?

323
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,227
Let's hear it.

324
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,400
I hope you like spaghetti.
Specialty of the house.

325
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,860
It goes with the opera.

326
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,953
It smells so good.

327
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,545
- Anything else for me to do?
- No, nothing.

328
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,796
Just make yourself at home.

329
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,716
- You can change the tape if you want to.
- No, this is great.

330
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,135
I love <i>Madame Butterfly.</i>

331
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,888
- Really? It's my favorite opera.
- Mine, too.

332
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,808
It's the first opera I ever saw.

333
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:50,604
My father, he took me to the old Met.
I was 5 years old.

334
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,232
- Did it make any sense?
- I got most of it.

335
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:58,320
There was this US sailor setting up
house with this Japanese lady.

336
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,616
That was all fine.

337
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:06,078
But in the final act, after he left her,

338
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:12,168
my father told me,
"She's gonna kill herself."

339
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,045
And I was terrified.

340
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:18,299
I was...
I climbed right underneath the chair.

341
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,428
It's right here.

342
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,765
This is it. It's right...

343
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,985
It's funny.

344
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,989
- What?
- It's one of the only times...

345
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,785
...I remember my father being nice
to me when I was a kid.

346
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,121
Comforting me at <i>Madame Butterfly.</i>

347
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:25,991
What?

348
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,329
What are you thinking?

349
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:37,086
I was wondering why is it that all
the interesting guys are always married.

350
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,088
Well, maybe that's why
you find them interesting,

351
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,507
the fact you can't have them.

352
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,052
How long have you been married?

353
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,430
Nine years.

354
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:53,018
- Do you have any kids?
- I got a 6-year-old girl.

355
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,356
Sounds good.

356
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,903
Yeah, I'm lucky.

357
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,283
So what are you doing here?

358
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,961
Boy, you know how to
ask the wrong thing.

359
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,047
No, I really want to know.

360
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:25,885
I had a wonderful time last night.
I'd like to see you again.

361
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,803
Is that so terrible?

362
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:29,722
No.

363
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,767
I just don't think it's possible, now.

364
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,983
It's really strange.
I feel like I know you already.

365
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,904
I just want to know where I stand.

366
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,784
I think you're terrific.

367
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,165
But I'm married.

368
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,753
What can I say? I...

369
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,092
Just my luck.

370
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,621
Shit!

371
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,501
- What are you doing?
- I gotta go.

372
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,420
I thought you said she wasn't
coming back till tomorrow.

373
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:47,591
She's not, but I got things to do, honey.
I got to go home.

374
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,973
- You know, I don't think I like this.
- Like what?

375
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:58,310
The way you run away
after every time we make love.

376
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,855
Well, Alex, what difference does it make
whether I leave now or in the morning?

377
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,023
The fact is, I gotta go.

378
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:06,360
- Well, you're not gonna leave now.
- Oh, come on. Will you stop it?

379
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,321
- I mean it.
- Come on! Hey, Alex! Come on!

380
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,119
What's the problem?

381
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,163
I'm sorry.

382
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,711
Jesus Christ, I mean,
let's be reasonable.

383
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,463
Be reasonable? What?

384
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,883
"Thank you, goodbye.
Don't call me, I'll call you."

385
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:33,804
Look, you knew about me, all right?
I didn't hide anything.

386
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,390
- I thought it was understood.
- What was understood?

387
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:39,393
The opportunity was there,
and we took it.

388
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:43,272
- Come on now, we're adults, aren't we?
- What's that supposed to mean?

389
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,275
- I thought we could have a good time.
- No, you didn't.

390
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,568
You thought you'd have a good time.

391
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,491
You didn't stop for a second
to think about me.

392
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,114
That's crazy. You knew the rules, Alex.

393
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,615
What rules?

394
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,786
Look, Alex. I like you.

395
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:01,540
And if I wasn't with somebody else,
maybe I'd be with you. But I am.

396
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,793
Please, don't justify yourself.
It's pathetic.

397
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:09,590
If you'd tell me to fuck off,
I'd have more respect for you.

398
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,136
All right then, fuck off.

399
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,765
And you get out!

400
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:38,952
I'm going.

401
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:42,539
Why don't you come over here
and say goodbye nicely?

402
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,334
Let's be friends.

403
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,389
Baby, no.

404
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,850
It's okay.

405
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,186
It's okay.

406
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:08,065
- Sorry if I upset you.
- It's okay, it's okay, really.

407
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,119
It's okay. All right. That's okay.

408
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,039
Your hands are all wet.

409
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:26,875
Jesus!

410
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:30,420
Jesus Christ!
Come here, come here, come here.

411
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,342
Hold on. Hold on.

412
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,228
Nice and tight.

413
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,219
Hi. Did you just call me?

414
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,972
I was in the shower. I heard the phone.

415
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,933
I thought it was you.

416
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:10,229
So, how are you?
Did you have a good day?

417
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,190
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:20,239
Really? That's terrific.
That's really terrific.

419
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,115
You sound excited.

420
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,245
Yeah.

421
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,290
No, I'm not against the idea, I mean...

422
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:33,752
Don't get me wrong. It's just the money.

423
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,131
Yeah.

424
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,513
Yeah.

425
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:48,308
Okay, darling. I love you.

426
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,561
Bye.

427
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,791
Alex?

428
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,718
How are you feeling?

429
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:26,805
Okay.

430
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,727
I gotta go.

431
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,522
Will you call me sometime?

432
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,942
You don't have to, if you don't want to.

433
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,610
No, I want to.

434
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,239
You promise me you're gonna go
see the doctor?

435
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,699
Okay.

436
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,460
Good bye.

437
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,462
Good bye.

438
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,717
- You take care.
- You, too.

439
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:34,748
Shit.

440
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:38,251
Look what I got.
Look what I got for you here.

441
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,088
A little spaghetti and meat sauce.
That's it, buddy.

442
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:44,758
We'll make an Italian out of you yet.
That's a good boy. Good dog.

443
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,802
Have a good one, yeah.

444
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:08,490
What are you doing here? It's 8:00 a.m.

445
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,952
I'm in the shitter, Martha. Got to be
in court by 2:00 and I'm really behind.

446
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,954
Will you do me a favor?
Cancel everything.

447
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,540
Then call Drimmer, tell him we're fine.

448
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,376
- I'll be there by 2:00.
- At 2:00? Okay.

449
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,504
Good morning, Martha.

450
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,638
- Daddy!
- Hey! Honey! Oh, God, I missed you.

451
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:32,889
- We had a great time!
- Yeah?

452
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:34,558
- I went for a walk with Grandpa...
- You did?

453
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,017
...and we saw rabbits
and chased them...

454
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,227
Well, good. Why don't you slow down?

455
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,645
I can't understand
one word you're saying.

456
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,939
- Daddy, I want a rabbit.
- I know you do, honey.

457
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,442
- Hi, darling. How are you?
- Good.

458
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,444
Good.

459
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,660
God, I missed you.

460
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,580
- Liar.
- I did.

461
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,585
Well, I should go away more often.

462
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:14,306
- I did this one.
- You did?

463
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,684
- Yes. Pick another one.
- I thought it was this row you picked.

464
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:21,563
- No. It was this one.
- I think you're in a lot of trouble.

465
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,001
- Okay.
- Now, pick a card, Dad.

466
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,170
Any card at all?

467
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,672
- Yeah? Where'd you learn this?
- Of course.

468
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,758
- Grandpa showed me.
- Oh.

469
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,595
Surprise.

470
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:00,352
So how was it?

471
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:05,023
Oh, come on, I'm a big boy. I can take it.

472
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:08,693
It had a place for rabbits.

473
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:12,989
Oh, no! She said it.
She said the R-word. Oh, no!

474
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,327
Not rabbits? Rabbits?

475
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,745
Rabbits!

476
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,248
- Rabbits!
- Not rabbits?

477
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,666
Rabbits!

478
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,252
Well, what can I tell you?
It's absolutely perfect.

479
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:28,463
- In this row?
- No.

480
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,592
So, when are you gonna come up
and take a look at it?

481
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,971
- Just for the hell of it?
- In this row?

482
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,848
How about tomorrow morning?

483
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:42,143
- Daddy, which row?
- You mean it?

484
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:45,313
If you get me back to the office
by 1:00, yeah.

485
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,148
Which row, Dad?

486
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:50,277
It's in this row, sweetheart.

487
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,258
Oh, I love this.

488
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:15,635
Dan?

489
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:20,223
Honey? Honey, come here.
I want you to see this.

490
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,439
Well?

491
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,692
It's... It's okay. It's okay.

492
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,655
- Come on, it's fantastic!
- It's great. It's great.

493
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:39,367
Just think of all the money we're gonna
save, not living in New York.

494
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:42,495
The local high school is excellent.
My own children went there.

495
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,624
- You see?
- This is a terrific area for kids.

496
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:48,001
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.
Is it okay if I go upstairs?

497
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,836
Please, go right ahead.
I'll wait for you down here.

498
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,296
Thank you.

499
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,967
You know, we still got to decorate.

500
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:58,762
We can fix up anything.
We can have painting parties.

501
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,723
Painting parties?
Beth, you're making me very nervous.

502
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:11,399
Well, now, look at this. This is fantastic.

503
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,528
This would make a terrific playroom.

504
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:17,530
What are you talking about, playroom?
This is my den!

505
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:19,074
It's a den!

506
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:21,868
I knew you were going to like it.

507
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,497
I like it.

508
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,804
I'll be in court. How you doing, Dan?

509
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,181
- Hi, Eunice. Martha back from lunch?
- Good afternoon, Mr. Gallagher.

510
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,642
- She just returned.
- Thank you.

511
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,110
Hi.

512
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:56,820
Hello.

513
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,532
This isn't a bad time, is it?
I was in the area. I figured that...

514
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,952
No, no.
You want to come into my office?

515
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,589
This is his account?

516
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:21,177
Hey, Danny. Danny, you gonna be
in your office a little later this...

517
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:24,431
- Excuse me? Have we met somewhere?
- I don't think so.

518
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,600
She looked at me first.

519
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,564
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

520
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,788
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

521
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:51,916
I was going to call you today.

522
00:45:56,546 --> 00:46:01,092
I... This is terribly embarrassing.

523
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,805
I just wanted to say sorry
for what happened.

524
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,058
I had no right to put you through all that.

525
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,980
Nothing happened, okay?

526
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,149
I was going through a bad time.

527
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:19,027
And everything was coming
to a crisis, and...

528
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,572
But I'm fine. I'm really all right.
And thank you.

529
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,576
- You don't have to thank me.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

530
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:29,621
A lot of guys would have just run away.

531
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:33,958
I don't know what I would have done
if you hadn't been there.

532
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:39,422
Well, you look good.
As a matter of fact, you look great.

533
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:42,091
Thanks.

534
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:46,554
So that's past?

535
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:48,431
Yeah.

536
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:54,229
- May I ask you one more favor?
- What's that?

537
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,860
I've got two tickets to Madame Butterfly,
two weeks from Thursday.

538
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:06,950
I'd really love it if you'd come with me,
kind of as a peace offering.

539
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:10,328
Well, that's very nice of you.

540
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,624
But I don't think it's a good idea.

541
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,210
- No strings attached.
- Alex.

542
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:21,256
I know, you don't have to explain.
I just thought I'd ask.

543
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,093
So...

544
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:31,724
I'll see you around sometime.

545
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,519
Okay.

546
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:49,909
Come here.

547
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,750
- Take care.
- Yeah. Good bye.

548
00:47:58,668 --> 00:47:59,961
Good bye.

549
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,575
All right. Come on, let's go, pal.

550
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:33,661
We're on a roll. We're on a roll.

551
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,292
- Let's see that action.
- Down the middle.

552
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,963
I like it. Very nice.

553
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:04,943
That is no good. I'm depressed.

554
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,806
What about
<i>Rodgers v.</i> whatchamacallit?

555
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,266
- Winitsky.
- Right.

556
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,395
I got your memo. You're going to
go for summary judgment?

557
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,772
Why not, Arthur?
I mean, the facts are not in dispute.

558
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,941
Rodgers admits
reading Winitsky's article.

559
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,652
The question is whether
he plagiarized it in his book.

560
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,445
As you know,
you can't copyright an idea,

561
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:51,155
only the expression of the idea,

562
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,826
and Rodgers sure as hell didn't use
any of the words in the book.

563
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,911
- Let me think about it.
- Okay.

564
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:59,038
So I hear you're about to
become a suburbanite.

565
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:01,207
Yeah, we're gonna take the big plunge.

566
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,918
- Got a buyer for the apartment?
- No.

567
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,921
- Got cold sweats about your escrow?
- Yeah.

568
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,716
But not about <i>Rodgers vs. Winitsky?</i>

569
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,467
- No, sir.
- Good.

570
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,303
He's still in a meeting.

571
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:18,850
Yes, I know.
I did expect him to be through by now.

572
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:25,023
I'd like you to have lunch with me
on Tuesday, if you're around.

573
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,650
Well, thank you, Arthur, that'd be great.
Let me just check my diary.

574
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:30,987
You are on his list of calls.
It's Alex Forrest.

575
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,449
Again? I thought you told her
I'd call her back.

576
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,743
- I did.
- All right. Put her on hold.

577
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:38,578
Would you mind holding?
He'll be free in a moment.

578
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,371
Tuesday would be great, Arthur.

579
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:43,624
- I look forward to it.
- Thank you. I will, too.

580
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,628
Put her through.

581
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:55,511
Hello?

582
00:50:56,471 --> 00:51:00,141
Look, Alex, I thought we agreed
this was not a good idea.

583
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,395
Why?

584
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,485
Look, I'm sorry.
I thought you understood.

585
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:13,696
If I've misled you in some way,
I apologize.

586
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,033
But I don't think it's a good idea
if we talk to each other anymore.

587
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,367
Okay?

588
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:21,412
Good bye.

589
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:31,756
Yeah, if she calls again,
tell her I'm not here. Thank you.

590
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,387
Wait, let me just...

591
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,514
Let me just look at you.

592
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:25,560
You're so beautiful.

593
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,271
Just so beautiful.

594
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,953
- Wouldn't you know?
- I know.

595
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:52,545
Open it, will you? That's my wife!

596
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:55,089
I wouldn't do it to my wife.

597
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:56,632
You know what? It's okay.

598
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:59,010
You don't know how many
injuries can happen?

599
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,179
- It's my wife he's doing it...
- Jimmy, don't terrorize them!

600
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:04,891
I'm a lawyer, I'm insured.
Oh, it's excited.

601
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,310
Now, don't forget who gave you this,
all right?

602
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:10,146
My cold sores are almost gone.
This is for you.

603
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,191
Ladies first. I use that term advisedly.

604
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,110
You're the best.

605
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,823
That's my wife! All right, ladies...
A little attention, please, ladies.

606
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:25,203
Gentlemen, my wife, ball and chain.

607
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,705
Mother of some of my children.

608
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,332
- I wouldn't be that confident about it.
- Absolutely.

609
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:35,004
Here is to Miller, Goodman,
Hurst and Gallagher!

610
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,965
- And to Mrs. Gallagher.
- Give me a break, will you, guys?

611
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:39,467
All he did is ask me to lunch, you know?

612
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,427
Yeah, and you're moving
to your country estate.

613
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,762
You'll forget you never knew us plebs.

614
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:45,681
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I read one of those self-help books.

615
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:47,433
Published by Robbins & Hart, of course.

616
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:50,353
Of course. <i>Samurai Self-Help.</i>

617
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:59,487
In it, it tells you how to deal
with the anxieties of your friends

618
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,906
as you move up the corporate ladder

619
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,991
and they stay put,
or God forbid, go down.

620
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:08,412
And in this book, it tells you not to
coddle your friends' anxieties.

621
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:11,707
So, I'm not gonna make
any false reassurances, guys.

622
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:14,001
I'm not gonna tell you you're gonna
be at the house every weekend.

623
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:15,836
I mean, let's face it.
Things have changed.

624
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,339
This is not a classless society.

625
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,093
As a matter of fact, this is it, guys.
Goodbye. Goodbye.

626
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,220
I knew he was gonna say that!

627
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,638
At least the man is running true to form.

628
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,515
Honey, I think we got to
make a clean break.

629
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,393
I mean, we're on a roll. We got to travel
light. You know, let's face it.

630
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,686
- Travel light. Exactly.
- Absolutely.

631
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:35,106
Thanks for the time
you've given us in your lives.

632
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:41,946
Here you, drink.

633
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,864
I want you with a lampshade
on your head by 10:00.

634
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:47,243
Why should today be any different,
you know what I mean?

635
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:51,289
Hello? Hello?

636
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,251
Here's to you.

637
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:57,878
Cheers.

638
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,300
Hello?

639
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,886
Hello!

640
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,260
Yeah?

641
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:54,268
Yeah, Richards. It's
kind of late, isn't it?

642
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:01,859
If you refuse to take my phone calls
at the office, you leave me no choice.

643
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:06,280
It's 2:00 in the morning here.
Can't this wait till tomorrow morning?

644
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:08,866
Oh, is it awkward for you to talk?

645
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:12,286
You could say that, yeah.

646
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,539
I've got to see you.

647
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:20,211
I don't have the documentation
to answer that question right now,

648
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,797
but I'll call you from the office.

649
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,176
No. Meet me in front of the
Robbins & Hart building tomorrow. 6:00.

650
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:31,222
Don't disappoint me. Be there.

651
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,225
Okay.

652
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:40,231
This has got to stop.

653
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:42,483
Dan, if you'd agreed to see me,
I wouldn't have called you.

654
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:45,152
Do you get it, all right? It's over.
There is nothing between us.

655
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:48,739
You've mean you've had your fun,
now you just want a quiet life.

656
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,241
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

657
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:51,409
You need help.

658
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:54,495
- Don't tell me what I need.
- You need a shrink.

659
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,664
Why are you so hostile?
I'm not your enemy.

660
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,082
Yeah, then why are you
trying to hurt me?

661
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,418
I'm not trying to hurt you, Dan.
I love you.

662
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:02,420
- You what?
- I love you.

663
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:06,794
- You don't even know me.
- Oh, how can you say that?

664
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:08,759
Alex, we spent a weekend
together, that's all.

665
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:11,345
You spent that second night.
You must like me a little.

666
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,514
Because I was concerned about you.
Jesus Christ!

667
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:15,015
Why do you read so much
into everything?

668
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,600
I mean, can't you understand?

669
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,936
I have a whole relationship
with someone else.

670
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:22,106
- I am very happy.
- Whole means complete.

671
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:24,942
If your life's so damn complete,
what were you doing with me?

672
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,506
Is this what you want to talk about,
our imaginary love affair?

673
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,113
I'm pregnant.

674
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:36,036
I saw my gynecologist on Monday.

675
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:38,956
Here's his card. You can call him.

676
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:47,214
You don't...

677
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:51,051
Use anything? No.

678
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:56,932
I had a very bad miscarriage last year.
I didn't think I could get pregnant.

679
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,311
And how do you know it's mine?

680
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,107
Because I don't sleep around.

681
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:18,120
I apologize.

682
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

683
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,419
Don't worry, all right? You're not going
to have to handle this alone.

684
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:27,004
Handle what?

685
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,342
The abortion. I'll take care of it.
I'll pay for it.

686
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,012
What makes you think
I want an abortion?

687
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:41,977
- You're not going to have the baby?
- Why not?

688
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:45,356
There are plenty of one-parent families.

689
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:49,109
- At least they don't end in divorce.
- I don't have a say in this?

690
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:53,113
I want this child.
It has nothing to do with you.

691
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:56,283
I want it whether you're going to
be a part of it or not.

692
00:58:56,367 --> 00:59:00,371
Then why are you telling me? Why?
Why not just go ahead and do it?

693
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:06,001
I was hoping that you would
want to be a part of it.

694
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:09,547
This is crazy. This is totally insane.

695
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,717
I'm 36 years old. It may be
my last chance to have a child.

696
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,052
Alex...

697
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:20,015
Just think what you're saying.

698
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,893
Just think about it.

699
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,565
We are going to live with this
for the rest of our lives.

700
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,234
I know that.

701
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:35,406
I've thought of that. I know how you feel.
It's a big thing.

702
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:39,451
But it doesn't have to be a problem.
Really, it doesn't.

703
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:43,122
You play fair with me,
I'll play fair with you.

704
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,798
"He led Agnes and Nellie
into the hall closet and shut the door.

705
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:56,385
"Agnes and Nellie and Oink
giggled and laughed in the dark.

706
00:59:56,468 --> 01:00:00,389
"Pearl listened outside the door.
'Oh, it works, ' cried Nellie.

707
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:03,934
"'Of course, ' said Oink.
'Look at the flying dog!' yelled Agnes.

708
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,769
"'WOW, ' cried Nellie.

709
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:09,315
"Pearl frowned. 'Who cares
about flying dogs?' she said.

710
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:11,108
"Nobody heard her.

711
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,485
"'Look out for the worms!'
squealed Agnes.

712
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:16,280
"'Eek!' yelled Nellie and Agnes together.

713
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:21,577
"'Look at the monster cockroach!'
yelled Oink. 'Ick! Help!"'

714
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:05,824
So, you know what I did? Right.

715
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,075
I call the doctor.

716
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:09,453
And you know what he says?
"Congratulations!"

717
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:12,873
I can't even imagine what she told him.

718
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,959
Anyway, that's not the end of it.

719
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,879
So, after I talked to the doctor,

720
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:22,341
this morning, I broke into her apartment.

721
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,719
I know.
Me, a lawyer, breaking and entering.

722
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:26,845
I don't know, I'm looking for something,

723
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,722
anything to get a handle on
what I'm dealing with here.

724
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:33,101
I thought maybe if I can find out she was
sleeping with somebody else, you know.

725
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:35,187
I didn't find anything.

726
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,236
Anyway, I didn't find anything.

727
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:47,157
Jimmy, I don't know. I don't know
anything about family law, okay?

728
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:48,867
So you gotta help me now.

729
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:51,703
What kind of case
does she really have?

730
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:56,166
Well, it ain't good.

731
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:01,380
She keeps calling the apartment.

732
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:05,843
Every time Beth answers the phone,
she hangs up.

733
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,721
I'm scared, Jimmy. I...

734
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:13,517
I don't want to lose my family.

735
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:23,861
<i>The facts as alleged are horrendous.</i>

736
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:27,030
<i>The instrument allegedly used
in all three cases</i>

737
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:28,782
<i>was an electronic shock device,</i>

738
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:32,661
<i>or stun gun, now standard
issue for New York City police.</i>

739
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:35,622
<i>The stun guns, which jolt
and incapacitate the body</i>

740
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:38,667
<i>by interrupting electrical waves
to the muscles,</i>

741
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:42,421
<i>are being used or experimented

742
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:43,589

01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:46,925
<i>marketed as an alternative

744
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:48,844
<i>Operator, may I help you?</i>

745
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:53,515
Operator, I've been trying to
get 555-812-9212.

746
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:55,475
The recording says
it's been disconnected.

747
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,561
<i>Just a moment, please.</i>

748
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,230
<i>I'm sorry. The number's been changed
to an unlisted number.</i>

749
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:01,648
Operator, this is a real emergency.

750
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:03,108
Please, you need to
give me that number.

751
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,277
<i>I'm sorry, we're not allowed to
give out that information.</i>

752
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:08,196
- Well, fuck you!
<i>- Oh, my place or yours?</i>

753
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:49,529
- I like it. I like it a lot.
- Well, we've been very happy here.

754
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:52,950
I'd definitely like to
think about it if I could.

755
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,328
- ...to clean and all?
- Yes.

756
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:57,663
I have a lady that comes in

757
01:05:57,788 --> 01:06:00,082
a couple times a week,
as a matter of fact.

758
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,209
And I can certainly give you her name
as well.

759
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,418
Oh, I'd love that.

760
01:06:03,502 --> 01:06:06,213
And I have babysitters galore.
The whole works.

761
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,966
Whatever information you would need.

762
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:17,766
Hi, darling. Darling, this is Alex.
I'm sorry, I've forgotten your last name.

763
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:21,353
- Alex Forrest.
- Alex Forrest, this is my husband Dan.

764
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,357
Hi. Glad to meet you.

765
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:29,444
Nice to meet you.

766
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:34,825
- Haven't we met somewhere before?
- I don't think so. No.

767
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:42,207
No, we have. Weren't you at that party

768
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,459
at the Japanese place,
a few weeks ago?

769
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:46,545
Honey, the exercise book.

770
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,171
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

771
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:49,756
You're a lawyer?

772
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,968
And you work for the firm of...
What's the name?

773
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,678
Well, anyway...

774
01:06:55,012 --> 01:06:56,972
We've definitely met.

775
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:01,810
- Well, you have a good memory.
- I never forget a face.

776
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:04,813
- It's a small world.
- It certainly is.

777
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:11,403
So, I gather you're going to the country?

778
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,864
- Moving to the country?
- Yes.

779
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:15,949
Have you found a place yet?

780
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:18,513
Actually, we found a place in Bedford.
Do you know it up there?

781
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:20,704
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- Yes.

782
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,874
So I guess you'll be moving out of here
almost immediately?

783
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:27,044
Actually, we wanted to do
some remodeling first.

784
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:29,671
I guess you're looking for a place
right away, aren't you?

785
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:32,674
Well, yeah. I'd kind of like to settle in.

786
01:07:32,758 --> 01:07:34,885
Alex is expecting a baby.

787
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:38,764
Oh, that's...

788
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:43,268
Will you excuse me?
I have some work I've got to do.

789
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:46,772
Oh, I better run, too.

790
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:49,900
Thank you for the tea
and showing me the apartment.

791
01:07:50,025 --> 01:07:53,570
- You're very welcome.
- I like it. I really like it.

792
01:07:54,029 --> 01:07:57,657
- We've been very happy here.
- I'd like to think about it if I could.

793
01:07:57,741 --> 01:08:00,577
Let me give you our number
so you can call us direct.

794
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,079
Thank you.

795
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,932
- I'll keep in touch.
- Great.

796
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,267
- Bye-bye.
- Good bye.

797
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:31,566
She seemed really interested.

798
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:37,114
It's funny, she didn't mention a husband.
I get the feeling that she's on her own.

799
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:40,700
- What is it? You seem down.
- No, no. I'm just tired.

800
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,638
- Hello?
- Yeah, hi, it's me.

801
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,640
<i>Who?</i>

802
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:08,311
You know damn well who it is, okay?
Now, come on. Let me in. I want to talk.

803
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,772
<i>Oh, so now you want to talk?</i>

804
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:30,000
So, what can I get you?

805
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:32,836
I've got Scotch, I've got vodka,
there's a nice Chablis...

806
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,964
Cut the shit, will you? Just cut it!

807
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:42,512
I don't know what you're up to,

808
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,598
but I'm going to tell you
it's going to stop right now.

809
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,850
No, it's not going to stop.
It's going to go on and on,

810
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,435
until you face up to your responsibilities.

811
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,270
What responsibilities?

812
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,772
I'm pregnant.
I'm going to have our child.

813
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:56,943
Alex, that's your choice, honey,
that has nothing to do with me.

814
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:58,695
I just want to be a part of your life.

815
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:01,364
Oh, this is the way you do it, huh?
Showing up at my apartment?

816
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,770
Well, what am I supposed to do?
You won't answer my calls.

817
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,146
You change your number. I mean...

818
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:07,704
I'm not going to be ignored, Dan.

819
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:14,544
You don't get it.
You just... You don't get it.

820
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,881
Don't you remember our weekend?

821
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:20,008
Wasn't that wonderful?

822
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,887
Why can't we just be like that again?

823
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:28,642
I know you feel it, too.
I mean, what are you so afraid of?

824
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:31,311
Hey, just don't flatter yourself, Alex.

825
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,231
Go ahead, hit me. If you can't fuck me,
why don't you just hit me?

826
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:37,734
You're so sad. You know that, Alex?
Lonely and very sad.

827
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:40,237
Don't you ever pity me,
you smug bastard.

828
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:42,989
I'll pity you.
I'll pity you because you're sick.

829
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:46,660
Why? Because I won't allow you
to treat me like some slut

830
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:51,081
you can just bang a couple of times
and throw in the garbage?

831
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:56,378
I'm going to be the mother of your child.

832
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:58,588
I want a little respect.

833
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:03,927
You want respect?

834
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:09,099
- Respect.
- What are you doing?

835
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:12,602
Please, Dan. Please don't go.
I didn't mean it. Please, I'm sorry.

836
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:14,604
I'll tell your wife.

837
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,192
You tell my wife, I'll kill you.

838
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,614
It only takes a phone call!

839
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,456
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

840
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:42,882
Got it.

841
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:46,970
Guys, that's on the second door
on the left of the landing.

842
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,430
Thank you.

843
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:50,974
Honey, you could've stayed
in the apartment.

844
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,310
Dan was in such a hurry to
get out of New York.

845
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:56,104
Momma, that's you, isn't it? Look.

846
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:58,231
Oh, Lord, put it away.

847
01:11:58,315 --> 01:12:03,403
All right, easy on that door frame.
Good. Right. Nice. Just like a glove.

848
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:21,796
I got it. Sorry. I got it.

849
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:29,888
Hello?

850
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:32,599
Martha.

851
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:39,356
Martha. It's Martha.

852
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,250
Hello?

853
01:12:59,334 --> 01:13:02,128
Hi, honey. How you doing?
Did the plumber come yet?

854
01:13:04,339 --> 01:13:05,882
Oh, did he ever.

855
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,385
Well, I don't really want to
know about it, all right?

856
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,762
Hey, guess what I'm looking at.

857
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:13,890
<i>- You got it?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, I got it right here.

858
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:16,226
Or, I should say, I got her.

859
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:18,478
What's she like?

860
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,897
Well, she's cute. She looks like a rabbit.

861
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:24,192
I mean, she's white, she's got long ears,
little pink eyes.

862
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:27,237
- Soft.
- She sounds cute.

863
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:30,573
Yeah. Ellen doesn't know
anything about it?

864
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:33,785
No. She doesn't think
she's going to get one.

865
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,287
See what happens if you work here
too long, Eunice?

866
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:38,498
- Isn't he cute?
- Thank you.

867
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:41,292
Oh, I forgot. This arrived for you.

868
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:44,170
- Good night, Eunice.
- Good night, Mr. Gallagher.

869
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:48,299
<i>And it's an inbound to Ewing on top.
Patrick gives it back to Gerald.</i>

870
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:49,968
<i>Gerald on the right to Sparrow.</i>

871
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:51,719
<i>Goes base line,
comes to the reverse side,</i>

872
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:53,012
<i>gives it off to Ewing.</i>

873
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:56,641
<i>He spins, knocks the man away,
throws the ball. Shot is good.</i>

874
01:13:57,934 --> 01:13:59,436
Hey, Joaquin!

875
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:02,856
<i>Holton on the outside.</i>

876
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:06,234
<i>Holding down a left-handed dribble
against Sparrow.</i>

877
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:09,529
<i>Now looking inside, looking in.
Finds no one...</i>

878
01:15:47,544 --> 01:15:49,504
Jesus fucking Christ!

879
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:53,675
Fucking bitch! Jesus Christ!

880
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:02,016
No. No. It had something to do
with the electrical system.

881
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:05,144
The whole goddamn thing blew up.
It was smoking.

882
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:07,230
All right, honey.
I'll see you in a little while.

883
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,501
Mr. Gallagher?
You forgot your contract.

884
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:29,752
Thanks.

885
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:39,530
<i>Hello, Dan. Are you surprised?</i>

886
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:43,284
<i>This is what you've reduced me to.</i>

887
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:47,622
<i>I guess you thought you'd get away
with it. Well, you can't.</i>

888
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:54,504
<i>Because part of you is growing
inside of me, and that's a fact, Dan,</i>

889
01:17:54,796 --> 01:17:58,341
<i>and you'd better start
learning how to deal with it.</i>

890
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:04,180
<i>Because, you know, I feel you.</i>

891
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:07,058
<i>I taste you.</i>

892
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:09,102
<i>I think you.</i>

893
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:11,813
<i>I touch you.</i>

894
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:16,734
<i>Can you understand? Can you?</i>

895
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:24,367
<i>I'm just asking you to
acknowledge your responsibilities.</i>

896
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,745
<i>I mean, is that so bad?</i>

897
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:33,042
<i>I don't think so.
I don't think it's unreasonable.</i>

898
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,920
<i>And, you know, another thing is</i>

899
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:40,675
<i>that you thought
that you could just walk into my life</i>

900
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:46,305
<i>and turn it upside down, without
a thought for anyone but yourself.</i>

901
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,707
<i>You know what you are, Dan?</i>

902
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:15,752
<i>You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch.</i>

903
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:19,839
<i>I hate you.
I bet you don't even like girls, do you?</i>

904
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:23,134
<i>You flaming fucking faggot!</i>

905
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:18,689
Daddy! Thank you.

906
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:21,484
You're welcome, honey.
Do you like her?

907
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:22,902
A bunny!

908
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,823
You like it?

909
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:26,883
<i>You thought you could just walk
into my life and turn it upside down,</i>

910
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:29,927
<i>without a thought
for anyone but yourself.</i>

911
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,346
<i>You know what you are, Dan?</i>

912
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:35,808
<i>You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch.</i>

913
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:42,481
<i>You are.
I bet you don't even like girls, do you?</i>

914
01:21:43,274 --> 01:21:47,236
<i>They probably scare you. I know I do.</i>

915
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:51,157
<i>So you're scared of me, aren't you?</i>

916
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,535
<i>You're fucking frightened of me.
You're afraid.</i>

917
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:55,661
<i>You're afraid, aren't you?</i>

918
01:21:55,745 --> 01:21:59,165
<i>You gutless, heartless, spineless,
fucking son of a bitch.</i>

919
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:02,460
<i>I hate you.
You deserve everything you get.</i>

920
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:06,088
- Jesus Christ!
- Sorry.

921
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,258
I was wondering what you were
doing up so late.

922
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:10,885
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

923
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:14,305
No, it's okay.
I was listening to a deposition.

924
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,015
I couldn't sleep.

925
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:18,726
Come on.
I'm going to give you a back rub.

926
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:21,896
- Back rub?
- Brandy, a back rub.

927
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:25,524
- You won't know what hit you.
- Sounds good.

928
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,990
<i>My client wants it stopped.</i>

929
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:36,661
<i>He just wants an end
to the harassment.</i>

930
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:39,956
He's positive it was this woman
who trashed the car?

931
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:41,666
Yes. Yes, of course.

932
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:44,585
- Any witnesses?
- No.

933
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:49,256
Welcome to file a complaint
if it'd make him feel better.

934
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,093
I mean, there's not a lot
you can do without proof.

935
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:55,596
Look, Lieutenant,
this woman is completely irrational.

936
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,160
There's no telling what she could do.

937
01:22:57,264 --> 01:22:59,976
We can't go around arresting people
for what they might do. You know that.

938
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:03,479
I'm not asking you to arrest her.
I... He simply...

939
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,319
He wants her warned.

940
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:16,784
Well, we could talk to her.
It may make things public.

941
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,244
He's not going to like that.

942
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,746
It may even aggravate the situation
with the girl.

943
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:21,956
How's that?

944
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,875
Well, whatever resentment
she's feeling,

945
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:27,211
she's probably got it out of her system.

946
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:30,214
And any action we take
could provoke her.

947
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:35,469
What if she didn't get it out
of her system? What then?

948
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:39,849
You have to catch her in the act.
Then we can bring charges.

949
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:42,476
Well, you say he just has to
sit there and take it?

950
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,355
It's his bed.
I'm afraid he's going to have to lie in it.

951
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:05,583
Come on. Come on in, come on in.

952
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:14,091
Come on, Ellen,
we're going to Grandma's.

953
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:16,594
Grandma's? Let's go.

954
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:21,557
Come on, Quince.
Quincy, come on, hurry up.

955
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,727
Come on, get on in. Hurry up.

956
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:27,772
Watch his tail, sweetie.
Make him sit down.

957
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:46,332
- See you didn't get your car back.
- No, it's a total write-off.

958
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:50,878
- The electrical system's just shot.
- Extraordinary, those foreign cars.

959
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:53,172
- There you are, dear.
- Thank you.

960
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,175
- Want to try it again, sweetie?
- Okay.

961
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:57,551
Okay.

962
01:24:58,052 --> 01:24:59,220
So?

963
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:05,935
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

964
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:07,770
Very good.

965
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:09,647
- You want to do it one more time.
- Okay.

966
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:11,398
Do it with your hat and do the bow,

967
01:25:11,482 --> 01:25:14,568
so when you actually do it,
you know what you're doing.

968
01:25:14,652 --> 01:25:16,904
- Let me see your bow.
- Okay.

969
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:20,908
And, what do you say?

970
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:25,788
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

971
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:29,125
- Very good. You got that.
- Ellen. Ellen.

972
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,626
Come here.

973
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,881
- That was good.
- Thank you.

974
01:25:35,965 --> 01:25:40,094
That was really good.
That was so good.

975
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:45,850
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

976
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:47,977
Thank you, darling.

977
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:13,836
Come on, Quincy.

978
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:39,088
- Daddy!
- What?

979
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:45,177
Whitey's gone!

980
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:46,595
Dan!

981
01:27:47,096 --> 01:27:48,180
Whitey's gone!

982
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:12,288
It's all right, darling.
It's going to be okay, sweetie.

983
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:15,624
You should try and get some sleep.

984
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:43,068
- Is she okay?
- She's asleep.

985
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:49,658
- Did you call the police?
- Not yet, no.

986
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:51,118
Why not?

987
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:56,498
Honey, we've got to talk.

988
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,175
What is it?

989
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:10,012
I know who did this.

990
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:14,641
You do? Who?

991
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:18,812
Remember the girl
who came to the apartment?

992
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:23,317
The one I met
in the Japanese restaurant?

993
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:27,654
The one with the blonde hair.

994
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:37,206
You're scaring me.

995
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,046
What is it?

996
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:47,883
Did you have an affair with her?

997
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:49,343
Yes.

998
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:05,067
Beth?

999
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:12,950
Beth, I am so sorry.

1000
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:19,289
The last thing I ever wanted to do
was to hurt you.

1001
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:24,670
Are you...

1002
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:28,882
Are you in love with her?

1003
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:34,847
No, no. It was one night.
It didn't mean anything.

1004
01:30:45,983 --> 01:30:50,487
What has it got to do
with what's happened?

1005
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:56,702
She's pregnant.

1006
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,205
She's...

1007
01:31:01,457 --> 01:31:02,958
It's yours?

1008
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:07,129
I don't know. That's what she says.
Honey, listen to me. Beth, please.

1009
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:10,507
Get out! I want you out of here.
I want you out of this house!

1010
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:13,760
And I want you out now.
How could you do that? I hate you!

1011
01:31:13,844 --> 01:31:16,013
Understand what I'm saying, honey.

1012
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,807
I don't want to hear it!
I don't want to hear any of it!

1013
01:31:18,891 --> 01:31:21,935
Please, just listen to me, will you, Beth?
Please. Listen to me.

1014
01:31:22,019 --> 01:31:24,271
What is the matter with you?

1015
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:37,177
Dan, what a pleasant surprise.

1016
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:43,559
It's over, Alex. It's all finished.
I told Beth, she knows all about it.

1017
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:47,020
<i>Sure. You haven't got the balls.</i>

1018
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:50,607
Why don't you speak to her?

1019
01:32:52,568 --> 01:32:54,945
Why would I want to talk to her?

1020
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:09,251
This is Beth Gallagher.

1021
01:33:09,418 --> 01:33:13,630
If you ever come near my family again,
I'll kill you, you understand?

1022
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:42,909
That's the last one, Ellen. I mean it.

1023
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:03,472
Hello? Hi, Daddy.

1024
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,977
When are you coming home?

1025
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:15,984
Honey, I don't know.
How are you doing?

1026
01:34:17,944 --> 01:34:19,112
Good.

1027
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:22,324
Okay.

1028
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:26,912
Yeah.

1029
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:29,623
Grandpa taught me a new card trick.

1030
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:32,209
Oh, did he?
What, the one with the jacks?

1031
01:34:32,334 --> 01:34:34,503
No, the one with the kings.

1032
01:34:36,505 --> 01:34:37,673
Good.

1033
01:34:41,677 --> 01:34:42,969
I won't.

1034
01:34:45,514 --> 01:34:46,723
Good.

1035
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:52,813
How's Mommy?

1036
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:55,565
Send her my love.

1037
01:34:55,982 --> 01:34:57,984
Okay. Goodbye.

1038
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,320
Daddy?

1039
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:03,490
Call me tomorrow.

1040
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:08,370
I will. I promise.
You be sure you tell Mommy I called.

1041
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:10,330
I will.

1042
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:13,667
Love you a lot, too. Bye-bye.

1043
01:35:18,588 --> 01:35:20,048
BYE-bye.

1044
01:36:02,382 --> 01:36:05,135
Hi, Mrs. Gallagher.
Did you forget something?

1045
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:06,470
I came to get Ellen.

1046
01:36:06,595 --> 01:36:09,931
Ellen? Why, I thought you picked her
up already.

1047
01:36:10,766 --> 01:36:13,143
Well, I'm sure she's left already.

1048
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:15,937
Betty?
Is Ellen in here with you?

1049
01:36:16,062 --> 01:36:17,856
- She's gone home already.
- Are you sure?

1050
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:20,776
I'm positive. She's not inside
and she's not in the playground.

1051
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:24,154
- I thought you picked her up.
- Who did pick her up?

1052
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:26,907
Well, don't worry.
She can't have gone far.

1053
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:30,118
- You don't understand.
- I'll check her locker.

1054
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:37,918
- Alicia, where's Ellen?
- She's gone.

1055
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,339
Call the police.

1056
01:36:47,469 --> 01:36:48,845
Ellen.

1057
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:52,474
Please, let her be all right.

1058
01:36:56,102 --> 01:36:57,437
Christ.

1059
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:02,150
Where are you?

1060
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:11,326
Ellen! Ellen!

1061
01:37:18,667 --> 01:37:19,835
Ellen!

1062
01:37:20,836 --> 01:37:22,087
Ellen!

1063
01:38:05,881 --> 01:38:07,716
Look out!

1064
01:38:25,734 --> 01:38:27,235
Where are you?

1065
01:38:53,929 --> 01:38:55,847
- Bye-bye, Ellen.
- Bye.

1066
01:38:56,765 --> 01:38:59,768
Ellen, can I have a kiss?

1067
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:05,273
- Bye.
- Bye.

1068
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:19,287
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient
named Gallagher. I'm her husband.

1069
01:39:19,371 --> 01:39:21,957
Room 22 at the end of the corridor.

1070
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,293
- Is she going to be okay?
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

1071
01:39:25,377 --> 01:39:28,546
She was very lucky. It might have been
a lot worse. A lot worse.

1072
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:32,217
- Daddy!
- Hi, baby. Oh, God, I missed you.

1073
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,969
I missed you, honey.

1074
01:39:34,052 --> 01:39:36,972
Are you okay?
Have you seen Mommy yet?

1075
01:39:37,055 --> 01:39:38,306
Yeah.

1076
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:42,560
Okay, you stay here with Granny.
I'm going to go see Mommy.

1077
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:55,156
Howard.

1078
01:40:10,964 --> 01:40:12,757
You'll be okay.

1079
01:41:09,022 --> 01:41:11,066
- You guys want to go to Ziggy's first?
- Yeah!

1080
01:41:11,149 --> 01:41:12,567
- It's a hot place.
- That's a good idea.

1081
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:14,569
All right! You know...

1082
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:08,052
I came in here before.

1083
01:45:08,136 --> 01:45:09,137
I tried to explain the situation to you,

1084
01:45:09,262 --> 01:45:10,305
you didn't want to listen to me.

1085
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:14,726
Now, the woman took my kid
and that's kidnapping, right? Am I right?

1086
01:45:14,809 --> 01:45:15,977
My wife's in the hospital.

1087
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,145
She could've been killed!

1088
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:18,229
If you're not going to
do something about...

1089
01:45:18,313 --> 01:45:21,316
Take it easy, okay.
You don't have to shout.

1090
01:45:22,317 --> 01:45:23,484
Okay.

1091
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:26,654
Okay. What are you going to do?

1092
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:32,410
We'll tell New York to pick her up
and bring her in for questioning, okay?

1093
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:35,330
Okay.

1094
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:38,082
Okay, then I'm...

1095
01:45:39,167 --> 01:45:42,086
I'm going to go to the hospital tomorrow,

1096
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:43,796
pick my wife up

1097
01:45:45,173 --> 01:45:48,134
and hopefully,
I'll be home for the weekend

1098
01:45:49,594 --> 01:45:51,804
if you need to talk to me.

1099
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,855
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1100
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:05,318
You're welcome.

1101
01:46:24,629 --> 01:46:27,799
How's that feel?
Good and warm? Good.

1102
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:31,969
Are you all cozy?

1103
01:46:32,053 --> 01:46:34,222
Is Mommy going to be all right?

1104
01:46:35,223 --> 01:46:38,976
Mommy's going to be fine, honey.
She's going to be fine.

1105
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:42,230
Are you going to stay with us?

1106
01:46:45,691 --> 01:46:48,236
I'm going to stay with you, honey.

1107
01:46:51,155 --> 01:46:53,324
Now, you go to sleep, okay?

1108
01:46:56,494 --> 01:46:58,246
Good night, doll.

1109
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:02,417
Forever?

1110
01:47:04,502 --> 01:47:06,212
I promise, honey.

1111
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:31,028
You mean the detectives in Manhattan
have no idea where she's gone?

1112
01:47:31,112 --> 01:47:33,531
They don't know where she is?

1113
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:39,078
Yeah.

1114
01:47:46,461 --> 01:47:48,254
No, I see. I see.

1115
01:47:48,754 --> 01:47:50,131
All right.
If you get anymore information,

1116
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:51,716
you'll be sure and let me know,
won't you, Lieutenant?

1117
01:47:51,799 --> 01:47:53,926
Thank you very much. Good night.

1118
01:47:55,303 --> 01:47:57,023
<i>I think we just found out
where the beef is.</i>

1119
01:47:57,096 --> 01:48:00,391
<i>Okay. Cathy and Charlie, who do you
think held out for the most money?</i>

1120
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:02,894
<i>The one who has to try out
the mysterious new shampoo,</i>

1121
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:04,896
<i>or the man who has to try
on the sundress.</i>

1122
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:07,815
<i>And remember,
it's possible that one of them...</i>

1123
01:48:10,776 --> 01:48:12,653
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1124
01:48:14,489 --> 01:48:16,324
How does the arm feel?

1125
01:48:16,449 --> 01:48:17,825
It hurts.

1126
01:48:18,659 --> 01:48:21,287
Get you some more painkillers.

1127
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:23,956
Okay.

1128
01:48:27,502 --> 01:48:30,671
<i>Welcome back. Our contestants
have been asked to decide...</i>

1129
01:48:45,186 --> 01:48:46,437
Thanks.

1130
01:48:46,521 --> 01:48:49,690
Now, you just holler
if you need anything else, all right?

1131
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:51,692
I'd love a cup of tea.

1132
01:48:52,193 --> 01:48:53,653
You got it.

1133
01:50:34,295 --> 01:50:36,380
What are you doing here?

1134
01:50:42,136 --> 01:50:43,888
Why are you here?

1135
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:53,648
He tried to say goodbye to me last night.

1136
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:56,484
But he couldn't,

1137
01:50:56,651 --> 01:51:00,571
because he and I feel the same way
about each other.

1138
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:07,662
Do you know how it is when you meet
somebody for the first time

1139
01:51:10,414 --> 01:51:13,125
and you get this instant attraction?

1140
01:51:22,927 --> 01:51:25,179
And don't you think I understand
what you're doing?

1141
01:51:25,304 --> 01:51:28,265
You're trying to move him
into the country.

1142
01:51:28,432 --> 01:51:31,018
And you're keeping him away from me.

1143
01:51:32,645 --> 01:51:35,523
And you're playing happy family.

1144
01:51:36,607 --> 01:51:41,987
But you wouldn't understand that
because you're so selfish.

1145
01:51:45,825 --> 01:51:49,787
And he told me about you.
He told me about you.

1146
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:51,706
He was very honest.

1147
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:07,179
If you weren't so stupid, you'd know that.
But you're so stupid.

1148
01:52:07,263 --> 01:52:10,891
You're just so stupid,
you're a stupid, selfish bitch!

1149
01:52:11,016 --> 01:52:12,601
You're a stupid, selfish bitch!

1150
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:31,245
Dan!

1151
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,294
Dan! Dan!

1152
01:52:41,255 --> 01:52:42,423
Dan!

1153
01:52:48,429 --> 01:52:49,597
Dan!

1154
01:52:51,932 --> 01:52:52,933
Dan!

1155
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:56,937
No!

1156
01:53:00,733 --> 01:53:01,776
Stop!
