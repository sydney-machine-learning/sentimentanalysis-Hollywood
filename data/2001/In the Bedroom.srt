1
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:41,507
I love it here.

2
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:43,769
I know you do.

3
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:51,812
I can feel my life, you know?

4
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:32,393
...pitch to Aderberg, and fall over
the outside corner of the field.

5
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,657
He was expecting a home run.
Pryor didn't say anything.

6
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:11,442
- Morning, Dr. Fowler.
- Morning, Natalie.

7
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,617
- How you doing, boys?
- Great!

8
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,250
Hey, Duncan,
sure you don't wanna go?

9
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:19,079
- You wanna get in here?
- No, he wants to stay here.

10
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:21,651
Scootch up,
get in the middle there.

11
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:24,287
Come on.

12
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,320
- Bye, Dr. Fowler.
- Bye.

13
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:28,753
You don't wanna wave goodbye?

14
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,948
You don't wanna wave goodbye?

15
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:35,117
Sweetie, what do you
want for breakfast?

16
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:36,721
Cereal.

17
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:39,487
...WEPI, Red Sox Radio Network.

18
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:41,993
You've been listening
to Red Sox Replay.

19
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:46,359
The USS Camden repeat broadcast
of Boston Red Sox baseball...

20
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:49,295
has been brought to you by
George C. Hollison of Rockland...

21
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:52,230
In business in Midwest since 1940.

22
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,838
There you go.

23
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,225
Oh, boy!

24
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:13,896
You see what happened
to this poor fella?

25
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:17,069
- What?
- Well, look. He lost an arm.

26
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:20,997
The trap has nylon nets
called "heads".

27
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:25,605
Two side heads
to let the lobster crawl in.

28
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:30,338
And inside, what's called
a bedroom head holds the bait...

29
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:34,033
and keep him from escaping.
You know the old saying:

30
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:37,212
"Two's company, three's a crowd"?
Well, it's like that.

31
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,573
More than two of these in a bedroom
and something like that's happen.

32
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:46,044
That's why Frank can't leave
these traps for more than a day.

33
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,547
Dad. Show him this one.

34
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,317
Now, the older females,
like this old gal...

35
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:59,448
are the most dangerous especially
when they're growing berries.

36
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:02,053
- Berries?
- Yeah, eggs.

37
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:04,724
She can take out two males,
no problem.

38
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,324
That's when you get
a lobster you can't sell.

39
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:11,286
But this fine lady,
she has it easy...

40
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:14,791
because the state says
we have to let her go.

41
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,262
Okay, now...

42
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,696
you think you can handle this?

43
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:26,930
Are you sure?

44
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:28,897
Okay, go ahead.

45
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:31,036
Put him in the tank.

46
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:34,367
Good!

47
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:37,469
- Higher, higher!
- Higher!

48
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:39,163
I'll swing you higher.

49
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:42,901
- Is that high enough?
- Yep.

50
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,538
- Ruth hates these.
- What?

51
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:55,579
- I got the wrong kind of buns.
- Maybe we could borrow hers.

52
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:03,346
What I would give
to have back my youth.

53
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:06,418
Well, Willis,
you never had that in your youth.

54
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,080
You can go play.

55
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:15,323
Father, you made it.

56
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:19,458
If I don't get to see you fellas
here, I don't get to see you at all.

57
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,726
You want a beer?

58
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:30,125
No. I'm gonna go see if
you mom needs any help, okay?

59
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:32,355
All right, good luck.

60
00:08:56,944 --> 00:09:00,434
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything here?

61
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:04,410
- You can hand me that bowl, dear.
- Great.

62
00:09:04,614 --> 00:09:08,275
- This one here?
- Yes, thank you.

63
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:16,610
I'm looking forward
to that concert on Labor Day.

64
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,150
The music's so unusual.

65
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:21,982
It's haunting, really.

66
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:24,416
It is, isn't it?

67
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,592
How did you learn about that...

68
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:34,424
...style?
- At Brown.

69
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:37,652
I did my thesis on
Eastern European folk music.

70
00:09:37,863 --> 00:09:40,888
- I thought about becoming a teacher.
- Why didn't you?

71
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:42,997
Mommy.

72
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:46,763
- Yeah, what are you eating?
- Nothing.

73
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:49,526
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

74
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:51,198
Swing me, swing me!

75
00:09:51,403 --> 00:09:54,802
Okay, I'll swing you, Dunc.
I'll be right back.

76
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:58,234
- So Mr. Strout mentioned you again.
- I'll bet he did.

77
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:01,874
Still talks about you. Says you're
the best can-packer he ever had.

78
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:03,701
Says you looked cute
in that hairnet.

79
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:07,899
Excuse me, boys. An offering.
Here, Father. Thank you.

80
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,907
That's what Charles Senior
is doing and...

81
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:14,773
Becky went to the hairdressing
academy after high school.

82
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,440
Of course, after she got married...

83
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:20,979
she decided she wanted to stay home
with the boys, you know.

84
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:23,973
She still loves doing hair, though.

85
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:27,114
Where do you go, Father?

86
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:29,650
I just go to Supercuts.

87
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,787
You can't request
the same girl at Supercuts.

88
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:36,479
The boys are having a great time.

89
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:38,681
It was good of you
to do this for them.

90
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:43,622
She hasn't brought them before cause
she's embarrassed. She shouldn't be.

91
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:47,194
I wish you hadn't put up
that monstrosity.

92
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:50,329
- We'll have to take it apart later.
- The swing?

93
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:52,054
The swing.

94
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:54,925
Come on, Ruth! He's a kid.
What do you expect?

95
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:58,463
"Happy birthday, here's a box.
Drag it around for a while!"

96
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,794
He's a kid, he's like me.
He wants it now.

97
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:05,632
Oh, the cake!

98
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:13,203
Great.

99
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:24,271
- Happy birthday, boy. Come here!
- Daddy, Daddy!

100
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:26,536
Yeah, Duncan!

101
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:30,276
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

102
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:34,473
Happy birthday, dear Duncan
Happy birthday to...

103
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:36,617
Mom, I don't wanna go.

104
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:38,952
Mom, I don't wanna go.

105
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,880
Shit. What's he doing here?

106
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,346
Hey, Jase.
Come on over here, buddy.

107
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:52,625
Daddy's taking us to the arcade.

108
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:55,259
I told you he'd come, buttface.

109
00:11:56,494 --> 00:12:00,155
Jason, don't do that to your
brother. Want me to do that to you?

110
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:02,886
We're supposed to meet
at the house at 6:30.

111
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,122
I thought we were meeting here.

112
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,490
Alright.

113
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,259
You're welcome to stay and
have some food. My dad's cooking.

114
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:24,165
Matt?

115
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:29,466
Should we do something?

116
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:32,166
No. It's okay.

117
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:40,241
Well...

118
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:44,013
...I'll see you later, then.
- Okay.

119
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,108
A little while.

120
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:56,412
She's not divorced yet, you know.

121
00:12:56,622 --> 00:13:00,488
It's the same thing.
Maine has crazy laws, that's all.

122
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:03,216
Anyway, he loves her boys.

123
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:08,451
- God, you don't think...
- No, he's not gonna marry her.

124
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:10,924
Well, then what's he doing
with her?

125
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,358
She probably loves him.

126
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:17,053
Girls always have.
Let's just leave it at that.

127
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,158
Well, he won't listen to me.

128
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,232
I've asked him 3 times
to dismantle that swing set.

129
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:28,927
Leave it up. Looks like
a young couple lives here.

130
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:34,670
Well, he needs his head
in school, not in her.

131
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:37,063
So to speak.

132
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:43,168
It would help
if you were on my side.

133
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:47,505
I can be on your side.

134
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:51,837
I've got a needle!

135
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:54,640
- I've got a needle!
- You don't need those.

136
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,745
Mr. and Mrs. Adamson?

137
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,113
You can put your shirt back on now.

138
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:18,026
Yesterday he was up and around
all afternoon...

139
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:20,194
but today he tumbled.

140
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:25,325
He's fallen twice, I have all
I can do to get him up.

141
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,088
He's weak.

142
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:30,389
Said when he couldn't work no more,
he didn't want to live.

143
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:33,328
So, for awhile he sat
and just mended our nets...

144
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,398
but he can't do that no more.

145
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:39,228
- How's you dad, Matt?
- Oh, I'm sorry, doctor.

146
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:43,632
Now, Elwyn, you remember. Jesse
Fowler passed away awhile ago.

147
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,829
We were at his funeral, remember?

148
00:14:47,474 --> 00:14:51,272
Back in an hour, Janelle.
I forgot my lunch.

149
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,966
Starting to become a habit.

150
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,138
You just missed him, Matt!
He went home for lunch today.

151
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:06,414
Right. I forgot,
he's got an interview.

152
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,213
Frank?

153
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:12,246
Hello?

154
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:14,513
Frank?

155
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:17,386
Yeah, Dad.

156
00:15:19,455 --> 00:15:23,219
What are you doing here? I thought
you were in Boston for an interview.

157
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,357
No. It was rescheduled.

158
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:30,683
Hi, Dr. Fowler.

159
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:33,384
Oh, hi.

160
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:36,286
Where are the boys?

161
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:38,991
They're with my mom.

162
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:47,263
Do you like coleslaw?

163
00:15:58,006 --> 00:15:59,905
Have some more.

164
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,865
You sure?

165
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:18,581
We gotta...

166
00:16:19,217 --> 00:16:21,116
Come on, son!

167
00:16:21,952 --> 00:16:25,215
- There, I see him right there!
- Hands up, chin up.

168
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,148
- Mom, I want to play!
- All right, all right.

169
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,515
- Mom, there's Frank!
- Here's your hat.

170
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,118
Wave, you guys.

171
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:39,087
- Mom, hurry up, I'm late!
- I'm hurrying.

172
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:41,883
- Mom, I want to play.
- All right, you'll play too.

173
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:43,560
But first watch...

174
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:47,991
Frank, did you tell your mom
how good it was?

175
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:49,822
How good what was?

176
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:52,759
Frank had quite a time
this afternoon.

177
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,028
Loved you coleslaw.
Ate enough for two.

178
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:58,394
Well, that's what it's for.

179
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,298
- Hot dogs?
- Yeah, I'll take one.

180
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:11,666
So, how are the kids?
Things okay?

181
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:14,475
Yeah, they're fine.

182
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:16,904
Good. That's good.

183
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,573
How was your interview?

184
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:23,509
- It was great.
- Good.

185
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:28,546
Jason? Jason!

186
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,578
Here!

187
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,342
- She's such a brave girl.
- That's it. You're driving me nuts.

188
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:38,576
I've had lots of girlfriends and...

189
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:41,879
I don't understand why
this one's any different.

190
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:44,519
I know you don't.

191
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,582
We're not serious, Ma.

192
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,456
No?

193
00:17:53,661 --> 00:17:55,389
No.

194
00:17:57,429 --> 00:17:59,520
It's a summer thing.

195
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,959
I see.

196
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,110
- How'd did you get in this time?
- Chimney.

197
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,312
Thank you.

198
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:49,982
What can I help you with?

199
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:53,013
I was just dropping that off
for Jason.

200
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:54,813
What?

201
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:56,614
That.

202
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:59,086
I didn't know where
he'd want to put it.

203
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:04,685
It's about time he got it.
What am I gonna do with it?

204
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,658
It's really gonna mean a lot to him.
He's really been improving lately.

205
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:10,886
Yeah, so I heard.

206
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:14,123
It would have been nice
if you'd come to his game.

207
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:16,560
Well, I just got your message.

208
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:21,457
Where are they? With him?

209
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:24,930
That's none of your business.

210
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:28,400
They're my boys,
but they're none of my business.

211
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:30,798
You know what I mean.

212
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,038
I was thinking about moving back.

213
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,475
Here. With you and the boys.

214
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:44,436
What are you talking about?

215
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:48,201
What am I talking about?
About moving back, that's what.

216
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:53,380
I know what you're thinking.
It's different now.

217
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,014
How's the job? Your father take
you back on at the cannery?

218
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:05,280
That's funny.
Still getting checks, aren't you?

219
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:08,388
Do I have to call
my father's accountant?

220
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:13,424
Did you see my new rig out there?

221
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:15,620
It's really nice.

222
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:19,352
It's not exactly new.
I traded David the truck for it.

223
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:22,652
Got room for all of us.
Good grocery-getting car.

224
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:28,162
You wanna take a ride?

225
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:32,959
Richard, you don't change.
You don't change, do you?

226
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:38,301
Change? No.

227
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,803
No, I don't change.

228
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,770
Everything around me changes.

229
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,634
You change.

230
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:48,666
You take my house...

231
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:51,372
and you take my kids...

232
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,341
and you fuck this other guy.

233
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,774
But me, I don't change at all.

234
00:20:57,612 --> 00:21:00,409
- It's not your house.
- Oh, really?

235
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:03,206
No. And as far fucking goes...

236
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:05,473
who answered the phone
the other morning?

237
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:09,117
- She...
- Doesn't matter! It's not working!

238
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:15,481
Nat, I just want a chance.

239
00:21:17,322 --> 00:21:21,154
For what? So you can pretend to be
a real father for a few days, and...

240
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:25,122
I am their real father!
I am their father.

241
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:30,260
No, Richard. You know what defines
a father? It's what he does.

242
00:21:30,462 --> 00:21:32,088
Not what he promises.

243
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:36,424
It's being a positive,
consistent presence.

244
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,057
A positive, consistent presence.

245
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:47,434
What does that mean?

246
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,534
I just don't get it.

247
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:52,330
But I'm not fucking
a college boy, am I?

248
00:21:54,973 --> 00:21:56,803
Look, you...

249
00:21:58,074 --> 00:22:02,338
Can you just go now? I don't want
you here when they get back.

250
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,374
You wouldn't want that?

251
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:08,777
No, you have to leave now.

252
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,408
Fine.

253
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:19,276
- I'll see you later, Richard.
- Goodbye, Nat.

254
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:45,959
I've ignored our difference in age,
but you play with those blocks.

255
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:48,653
I'm gonna start to worry.

256
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,525
You're not looking at the house.
Look.

257
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,133
It's not all mine, it's part Mack.

258
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:08,830
What Mack was trying to achieve
was a common area in the center.

259
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:11,564
Large open spaces
aren't unique to Mack...

260
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:14,265
but the idea of
separating the family...

261
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:18,672
so that the parents were on one side
and the kids are on the other side.

262
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:23,936
So they all spill into the center.
It's brilliant. It's...

263
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:28,246
I'm boring you, aren't I?

264
00:23:32,252 --> 00:23:34,446
I was just thinking.

265
00:23:37,821 --> 00:23:39,549
About what?

266
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:42,678
About you.

267
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,985
School.

268
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:52,520
What if I wait a year?

269
00:23:55,228 --> 00:23:56,786
Frank!

270
00:23:56,997 --> 00:24:01,021
- A year won't make a difference.
- You can't do that, Frank.

271
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,290
Why not?
I've thought a lot about this.

272
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:07,433
I have, and...

273
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:09,396
No. You...

274
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:12,930
You told me it takes forever
just to establish yourself.

275
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:16,536
Exactly.
So what's a year in forever?

276
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:25,500
That's twisted logic.

277
00:24:28,645 --> 00:24:30,612
Do you know what Duncan
said to me today?

278
00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:33,405
You wouldn't be changing
the subject, would you?

279
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:38,538
He said, "Frank, I don't think
Jason really understands girls".

280
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:41,283
- Oh, he didn't.
- He did.

281
00:24:42,784 --> 00:24:44,978
Understands girls.

282
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,416
What did you say?

283
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,587
I just didn't know
what to say to that.

284
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:54,882
I said, "Give him time, Duncan,
he'll come around".

285
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,087
If this is how he is now,
then we're in trouble.

286
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:18,998
What is this? Action Man?

287
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:24,803
Richard gave it to Dunc
for his birthday.

288
00:26:02,422 --> 00:26:04,116
Very good.

289
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:07,221
Okay, it's 7:30.
We should stop now.

290
00:26:07,424 --> 00:26:10,789
Now remember,
when you sing these words...

291
00:26:10,992 --> 00:26:13,221
the way we feel about
the harbor is the way...

292
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:15,553
the Balkans felt
about the River Sava.

293
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,886
And listen to your tapes.

294
00:26:18,095 --> 00:26:21,824
"Moilih Ta" is still very rough
and we've got a 40-minute...

295
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,020
program to have ready
by Labor Day.

296
00:26:25,265 --> 00:26:27,129
Labor Day.

297
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,633
- And Anna?
- Yeah, Mrs. Fowler?

298
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:31,733
Next time, duck.

299
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:37,567
Great.

300
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,196
Dad.

301
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:44,099
Is it acid?
What are you putting in there?

302
00:26:44,774 --> 00:26:48,208
- My God, what happened?
- Frank, hold still.

303
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:51,205
- Dad.
- This was her husband, wasn't it?

304
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,969
Ex. He dropped in.

305
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,476
You gonna press charges?

306
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:58,776
What's to stop him
from doing it again?

307
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:00,845
Did you hit him at all?
Tell me you hit him.

308
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:03,641
- Just so he doesn't do it again.
- I don't think I touched him.

309
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,681
- Jesus! Dad. dad.
- So what are you gonna do?

310
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:11,445
- Take karate.
- That is not the problem.

311
00:27:11,654 --> 00:27:15,712
- Mom, you know you like her.
- I like a lot of people, Frank.

312
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:17,888
What about the boys?
Did they see it?

313
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,989
No, they were asleep.

314
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:22,420
Did you leave her alone with him?

315
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:25,787
He left first.
She was yelling at him...

316
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:27,688
I believe she had
a skillet in her hand.

317
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:30,726
For God's sakes.
Did you call the police?

318
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:32,953
- Not yet.
- You didn't call them?

319
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:35,688
Well, I just got in. When did I have
the chance to call the police?

320
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:37,923
- Where's the phone?
- No, Mom. Don't call them!

321
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:40,861
They'll come over
and scare the kids.

322
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:45,500
- You gotta call them.
- It was a scuffle, wasn't serious.

323
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:50,103
- Like the relation isn't serious.
- Ruth, now is not the time.

324
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:53,272
When is the time?
After he knocks him into a coma?

325
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:57,032
- This is stopping now.
- Oh, really?

326
00:27:57,775 --> 00:28:01,539
Come fall, you're on a plane.
Are you taking them with you?

327
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,333
What are the boys gonna think
when you just disappear?

328
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:05,978
Easy, Mom.

329
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:10,170
Frank, this is not some sweetie from
Vassar you can visit on holidays.

330
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:12,348
You're not in this alone.

331
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:15,880
And the sooner you end it,
the better.

332
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,383
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

333
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,251
Well, you gotta talk to him, Matt.

334
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,281
I don't know.

335
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:37,852
Maybe he's right
about scaring the kids.

336
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:42,288
Why don't we just sleep on it,
deal with it tomorrow?

337
00:28:42,629 --> 00:28:44,596
Are you gonna call the police
or do I have to?

338
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,797
I just told you what I think.
If you want to call them, call them.

339
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:12,601
It's not the first time
she's played around, you know.

340
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,505
- She's not with the guy anymore.
- No, I mean from before.

341
00:29:16,712 --> 00:29:20,339
- What do you mean?
- You've heard the same things.

342
00:29:20,747 --> 00:29:25,238
You seem to forget. I don't take my
lunches in the teachers' lounge.

343
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:34,611
Maybe he still loves her.

344
00:29:38,322 --> 00:29:40,619
Best part of the cod.

345
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:43,188
The outsiders, they won't touch it.

346
00:29:43,424 --> 00:29:46,688
The summer fishermen.
They're part-timers like Frank here.

347
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:48,723
Get in your hair.

348
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:51,086
As many as 80% of them
now with licenses.

349
00:29:51,294 --> 00:29:55,251
Should put up a sign: "Stay in your
own back yard, or lose your traps".

350
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:59,556
Henry is just sore because I catch
about twice as much as he does...

351
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,425
with an old second-hand Boudreau.

352
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:06,033
Now don't you listen to him, son.
That boat is fine. She was my first.

353
00:30:07,536 --> 00:30:12,436
I kind of miss her sometimes.
And that truck you're driving.

354
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:15,938
When you heading
back to school, Frank?

355
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:34,171
Hello, Dr. Fowler.

356
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:36,439
- How you doing, Jason?
- Good.

357
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,043
What'd you pull?

358
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:52,382
Not too bad. About 40 pounds.

359
00:30:54,324 --> 00:30:56,813
I haven't caught sight of you
in days.

360
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,918
- You know where to find me.
- When are you coming home?

361
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:03,493
Has it come to this?

362
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,491
Come to what?

363
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:09,658
You having to run errands for Mom.

364
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:15,956
I'm thinking of building
a couple hundred more traps.

365
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,963
See if I can do better
than break even.

366
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,227
It'll take you more then 2 years
to get an off-season license.

367
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:25,632
Unless Henry takes me
on as his sternman.

368
00:31:26,106 --> 00:31:28,629
- You think he'd do that?
- Maybe.

369
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:33,301
It's as good a life as any.

370
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:35,203
It was good enough for your father.

371
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,536
And sometimes things
just skip a generation.

372
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:43,210
You don't think...?

373
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:47,206
You don't think you might
need something more?

374
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:51,714
Why? So I can have an Ivy League
education like you, and...?

375
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:57,678
If it's so great, why do you
sneak out every day to come here?

376
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:04,018
I like spending time with my son.

377
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,663
I don't know, Dad.

378
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,459
It's just... I don't know.

379
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:33,195
She's a wonderful girl.

380
00:32:35,271 --> 00:32:37,601
And that's what I see.

381
00:32:43,474 --> 00:32:46,374
Frank! How long will
you be parked here?

382
00:32:46,677 --> 00:32:48,644
I'd like to unload.

383
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:51,572
- Give me a hand?
- Yeah, sure.

384
00:33:03,484 --> 00:33:06,918
You can't hypnotize
the cards into changing, Matt.

385
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:10,111
Christ! Bet, or Carl'll start.

386
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,788
"The beggar's dog
and the widow's cat...

387
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:15,319
Feed them and thou wilt grow fat.

388
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:20,719
The gnat sings his summer's song,
poison gets from slander's tongue.

389
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:26,086
The poison of the snake and newt
is the sweat of envy's foot.

390
00:33:26,328 --> 00:33:29,763
The poison of the honey bee
is the artist's jealousy."

391
00:33:29,962 --> 00:33:32,122
All right, Carl. Two bucks.

392
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:35,826
I tell you, man, you gotta
get out of this Blake thing.

393
00:33:36,032 --> 00:33:37,896
- You're in a rut.
- Don't get him started.

394
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,693
Whenever I do my own stuff,
you guys bitch and moan.

395
00:33:41,902 --> 00:33:45,859
- That's not true.
- We love your stuff. It's great.

396
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:49,261
- Carl?
- I'm in.

397
00:33:49,472 --> 00:33:51,666
Everybody in? Frankie, you in?

398
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:58,539
Guess I'm the winner.

399
00:33:58,743 --> 00:34:01,336
Always the quiet ones.

400
00:34:01,545 --> 00:34:02,670
Deal.

401
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:04,640
Come on. Come on.

402
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,619
Don't mind me.
Your father's snoring.

403
00:34:43,163 --> 00:34:46,188
Eat. You must be hungry.

404
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:48,995
I'm not hungry.

405
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,599
Coffee?

406
00:34:57,904 --> 00:35:00,029
So you talked to her?

407
00:35:05,907 --> 00:35:08,238
And? How is she?

408
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:10,539
She's great.

409
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,876
Frank, I just want
to tell you that we...

410
00:35:17,947 --> 00:35:20,039
That I liked her.

411
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:22,371
Do like her.

412
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:24,876
She's a wonderful girl.

413
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:28,016
Ma, you're not gonna have
this conversation with me...

414
00:35:28,218 --> 00:35:30,048
right now, are you?

415
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:43,088
- Good night.
- Good night.

416
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,783
Okay.

417
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:51,655
All right. No, that's fine, sir,
I'll send right away.

418
00:35:53,463 --> 00:35:57,056
Okay. I'm very excited. I'm...

419
00:35:57,832 --> 00:36:02,459
It's a beautiful campus
and I'm preparing already.

420
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:06,762
Yes, Thank you, thank you, sir.

421
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,562
Yes, well, compared
to your models...

422
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:12,397
It doesn't compare
to your models, but...

423
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:16,439
I am. I'm aware
of the Lautner house.

424
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:21,340
Yeah. Excuse me, sir,
can you hold on one second?

425
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,275
Jase?

426
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,379
Jase, what is it?

427
00:36:35,682 --> 00:36:38,206
Okay, Jason, stay put.

428
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:40,411
I'll be right there. Stay put.

429
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:45,052
He just... he just pushed me.

430
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:48,415
- He didn't hit me.
- He didn't hit you?

431
00:36:48,622 --> 00:36:52,113
Great. We should throw a party
for him. He didn't hit you.

432
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:56,088
- We're calling the police.
- No, wait, wait!

433
00:36:56,292 --> 00:36:58,623
- We're calling the police.
- No, I don't...

434
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:00,885
I don't know what I want to do.

435
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:04,187
I hate this.
I hate the kids seeing this.

436
00:37:04,563 --> 00:37:07,189
- I don't know what to do!
- Listen.

437
00:37:07,397 --> 00:37:09,864
It's okay, it's okay.

438
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:13,763
I'm here now. I'm here now.
It's all right.

439
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,459
I'm not going anywhere.

440
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,865
Okay.

441
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:22,627
It's all right.

442
00:37:26,373 --> 00:37:28,135
Mom!

443
00:37:33,743 --> 00:37:36,210
- Go upstairs with the kids.
- No. Frank...

444
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:40,135
I'm not letting him in the house!
Go upstairs!

445
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:43,039
It's better if he doesn't see you.
Go upstairs!

446
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:45,576
Don't let him in. Don't let him in.

447
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:47,646
- Go.
- Frank, don't let him in.

448
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:50,911
Open the door!

449
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:54,045
Frank?

450
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:56,685
Frank, buddy. You in there?

451
00:37:57,821 --> 00:38:00,687
Sorry about what happened.
All right?

452
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:04,220
I apologize. I'm sorry about
what happened. Now open the door.

453
00:38:04,424 --> 00:38:06,357
- Richard, leave.
- Open up.

454
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,151
- Leave now! I'm not letting you in.
- Open the door!

455
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,657
She left! And I'm calling
the police if you don't leave.

456
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:16,186
Just go.

457
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:18,623
All right. All right.

458
00:38:40,774 --> 00:38:41,968
Get out, motherfucker!

459
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:44,664
Read him a story,
I'll be right back.

460
00:38:44,876 --> 00:38:48,174
- I don't want to stay here!
- You have to.

461
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:50,970
You have to stay here! Look at me!
You're staying here, okay?

462
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:52,406
Read him a story.

463
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:54,842
Where is she?

464
00:38:55,415 --> 00:38:59,042
You're fucking lying!
Where is she? Natalie!

465
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,308
Put that away!
Put that away!

466
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:22,554
Mommy!

467
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,630
There's a Mrs. Strout on line two.
She says it's very Important.

468
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:40,099
Natalie?

469
00:40:17,987 --> 00:40:19,544
Great.

470
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:32,386
"Your fear of death is but the
trembling of the shepherd...

471
00:40:32,593 --> 00:40:34,719
when he stands before the king...

472
00:40:34,928 --> 00:40:37,827
whose hand is to be laid
upon him in honor.

473
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:41,422
Is the shepherd not joyful
beneath his trembling...

474
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:44,496
that he should wear
the mark of the king?

475
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:48,564
Yet is he not more mindful
of his trembling?

476
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:53,401
For what is it to die
but to stand naked in the wind...

477
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:55,899
and to melt into the sun?

478
00:40:56,104 --> 00:40:58,196
And what is it to cease breathing...

479
00:40:58,438 --> 00:41:02,270
but to free the breath
from its restless tides...

480
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:07,805
that it may rise and expand
and see God unencumbered?

481
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:13,201
Only when you drink from the river
of silence shall you indeed sing.

482
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:15,969
And when you have reached
the mountaintop...

483
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:18,908
then you shall begin to climb.

484
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:22,444
And when the earth shall
claim your limbs...

485
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,845
then shall you truly dance."

486
00:42:17,642 --> 00:42:19,801
Can I get you anything?

487
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:28,239
- Where's Ruth?
- She went to lie down, Matt.

488
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:32,577
Excuse me.

489
00:44:44,377 --> 00:44:48,641
My next guest is a very talented man
who'll performed live this month...

490
00:44:48,846 --> 00:44:51,813
at the Montreal Comedy Festival,
"Just For Laughs".

491
00:44:52,014 --> 00:44:54,447
Please welcome Anthony Clark!

492
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,046
Some more?

493
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:09,955
- How we doing?
- So nice! Wow!

494
00:45:10,156 --> 00:45:12,281
- They're good people.
- They really are.

495
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,957
Some of them were packing,
but we've cleared that up.

496
00:45:15,158 --> 00:45:16,590
- That's good.
- So, what's been on?

497
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:21,250
Actually I've been out with Ricky
Martin "Living the Vida Loca".

498
00:45:22,228 --> 00:45:26,959
When you hang out with Ricky
people speak Spanish to you...

499
00:45:27,163 --> 00:45:32,655
and i think that's cool after three
years of Spanish in high school...

500
00:46:12,618 --> 00:46:14,881
Matt, I'm gonna go to lunch.

501
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:20,712
Can I get you anything?

502
00:46:22,456 --> 00:46:24,787
No, I'm fine.

503
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:28,287
Are you sure?

504
00:46:30,627 --> 00:46:32,923
Yeah, I'm okay.

505
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:36,888
Okay.

506
00:47:01,674 --> 00:47:04,005
Don't worry. I didn't make them.

507
00:47:05,643 --> 00:47:09,304
- I wanted cheese.
- What? Oh! That's mine.

508
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:12,875
Sorry.

509
00:47:19,682 --> 00:47:22,047
You got back to work so quick.
It's no too soon?

510
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,479
I can't stay home.

511
00:47:26,686 --> 00:47:29,619
- So, how's business?
- You know. Same old crap.

512
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:31,685
Got held up again. You know that.

513
00:47:31,888 --> 00:47:35,913
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah. They got 75 bucks.

514
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:38,287
Were you on the till?

515
00:47:38,491 --> 00:47:41,357
They'd have gotten something else
if I'd been on the till.

516
00:47:46,261 --> 00:47:49,558
So how you doing? You don't
write or call. Where'd the love go?

517
00:47:49,763 --> 00:47:51,889
Nag, nag, nag.

518
00:48:01,435 --> 00:48:04,130
They set the bail hearing yet?

519
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:08,335
- Sometime in the next few days.
- Are you going?

520
00:48:09,906 --> 00:48:11,929
I don't know.

521
00:48:13,575 --> 00:48:16,906
Davis says it's a formality,
really.

522
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:22,071
I haven't talked with Ruth about
whether or not we ought to go.

523
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:24,643
If it's too much for Ruth,
I'll come with you.

524
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:27,905
Thanks. It'll be all right.

525
00:48:29,482 --> 00:48:32,006
Davis says it's a formality.

526
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:37,683
The criminal trial set yet?

527
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:42,249
- October.
- October?

528
00:48:42,454 --> 00:48:45,354
- That's what they tell me.
- Christ, they take their time.

529
00:48:48,023 --> 00:48:51,286
- He's in there now.
- They're keeping him busy, I'm sure.

530
00:48:51,492 --> 00:48:53,925
You know where they'll move him
once he's sentenced?

531
00:48:56,261 --> 00:48:58,784
You got any tabasco?

532
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:04,319
Anita! Tabasco!

533
00:49:06,665 --> 00:49:08,291
Shit!

534
00:49:26,642 --> 00:49:30,337
Next weekend we really want
you to come up to the camp.

535
00:49:30,543 --> 00:49:33,807
Katie's insisting. Not to pressure
you, but if you don't come...

536
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,877
she'll invite her sister
and that idiot, and...

537
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,513
I'll wind up insulting him again.

538
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:42,204
The future of my family
is in your hands.

539
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:46,715
Let me ask Ruth.

540
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:01,815
- How was your day?
- Fine.

541
00:50:02,925 --> 00:50:05,358
I had lunch with Willis.

542
00:50:05,927 --> 00:50:10,224
- It was really great to see him.
- My day was fine too, thanks.

543
00:50:11,096 --> 00:50:13,562
Sorry, did you say something?

544
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:26,001
Katie and Willis invited us
up to the camp for the weekend.

545
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:30,103
I said I'd check with you, in case
we were doing something else.

546
00:50:32,272 --> 00:50:34,466
That sounds fine.

547
00:50:35,707 --> 00:50:38,299
We don't have to go.

548
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:41,008
You don't want to?

549
00:50:42,043 --> 00:50:44,135
Yeah, I want to.

550
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:46,636
Then tell them yes.

551
00:50:46,846 --> 00:50:51,610
I thought you might be
busy getting the girls ready.

552
00:51:14,926 --> 00:51:20,452
AI right. The next matter is the
state of Maine vs. Richard Strout.

553
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:23,094
The record should reflect
the defendant was...

554
00:51:23,296 --> 00:51:26,923
incarcerated in Knox County
Jail without bail since...

555
00:51:27,131 --> 00:51:31,623
the 17th of July.
We're here for a bail hearing.

556
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:34,993
Mr. Davis, given the fact we have
a very crowded trial calendar...

557
00:51:35,202 --> 00:51:38,931
I suggest we do both bail hearing
and probable cause hearing today...

558
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:42,195
at 2:00. So unless I hear
any objection on the contrary...

559
00:51:42,405 --> 00:51:43,803
I'd like to set it for 2:00...

560
00:51:44,005 --> 00:51:46,939
and we will take testimony
of your witness at that time.

561
00:51:49,045 --> 00:51:50,909
I...

562
00:51:52,013 --> 00:51:54,310
I closed the door.

563
00:52:02,384 --> 00:52:05,818
I walked through my room.

564
00:52:07,087 --> 00:52:12,579
I heard some yelling.
I heard yelling. Heard yelling.

565
00:52:14,057 --> 00:52:16,923
I got to the stairs...

566
00:52:25,129 --> 00:52:27,358
and then I heard...

567
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:31,122
I heard the shot.

568
00:52:33,399 --> 00:52:35,764
- And Richard...
- I'm sorry.

569
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:39,367
- Richard...
- Could we go back just a minute?

570
00:52:39,768 --> 00:52:43,293
Mrs. Strout, you said
you heard the shot.

571
00:52:45,938 --> 00:52:50,339
You heard the shot? Did you
actually witness the accident?

572
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:54,031
Objection. There are no grounds
to indicate this was an accident.

573
00:52:54,243 --> 00:52:57,540
Sustained. Strike the word
"accident" from the record.

574
00:52:57,744 --> 00:53:00,472
Rephrase your sentence, Ms. Keyes.

575
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:06,210
Mrs. Strout, in the police
report you stated...

576
00:53:06,414 --> 00:53:11,815
that you had witnessed
the firearm discharge.

577
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:16,276
Did you witness
the firearm discharge?

578
00:53:34,161 --> 00:53:37,720
I thought you said there'd be
a jury trial sometime in October.

579
00:53:37,929 --> 00:53:39,862
If he was incarcerated...

580
00:53:40,063 --> 00:53:42,121
the judge would have set
an October court date...

581
00:53:42,331 --> 00:53:45,787
to save the county the cost
of housing him as an inmate.

582
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,162
But with bail, unfortunately,
the court date is always later.

583
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:53,233
You mean there's nothing
we can do about this?

584
00:53:53,503 --> 00:53:56,868
You let him walk out,
and we're supposed to sit here?

585
00:53:57,338 --> 00:54:00,669
We can't appeal bail.
It's just not set up that way.

586
00:54:01,474 --> 00:54:05,840
The state's bail code is to ensure
future court appearances.

587
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:11,443
In this case, Strout's family put up
a great amount of property as bail.

588
00:54:11,645 --> 00:54:14,238
That, along with his ties
to the community...

589
00:54:14,446 --> 00:54:18,505
made it hard to convince the judge
there was a risk of flight.

590
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:22,671
Now, you can file a civil suit.
I recommend it.

591
00:54:22,883 --> 00:54:25,680
But not now.
After the criminal trial.

592
00:54:25,885 --> 00:54:27,852
And when will that be?

593
00:54:28,053 --> 00:54:33,420
Well, honestly, could be
anywhere from 12 to 18 months.

594
00:54:33,622 --> 00:54:35,418
My God.

595
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:38,852
You're confident you can put him
away for good then, right?

596
00:54:49,496 --> 00:54:52,259
The things she said in there.

597
00:54:52,931 --> 00:54:55,228
What's the damage?

598
00:54:57,266 --> 00:55:02,633
The way this is going,
potentially... manslaughter.

599
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:05,597
Jesus Christ!

600
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:09,032
He killed our son!

601
00:55:09,705 --> 00:55:14,834
- He... It was no accident!
- Ruth, Ruth.

602
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:20,765
How long will he be sent away for?

603
00:55:20,977 --> 00:55:24,968
That's hard to say.
Anywhere from 5 to 15 years.

604
00:55:25,179 --> 00:55:27,612
But we're confident
we'll get the maximum.

605
00:55:27,814 --> 00:55:33,613
- So even with good behavior...
- 5, 10 years? Are you crazy?

606
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:40,252
Dr. Fowler, Mrs. Fowler,
I'm sorry.

607
00:55:40,453 --> 00:55:43,852
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

608
00:55:45,355 --> 00:55:47,379
No, you don't.

609
00:56:34,245 --> 00:56:38,043
- Doctor, what were you expecting?
- I have no idea.

610
00:56:38,914 --> 00:56:42,245
Dr. Fowler, how do you feel
about Strout's bail?

611
00:56:45,483 --> 00:56:48,973
Dr. Fowler, have you had
contact with Mr. Strout?

612
00:56:49,852 --> 00:56:52,751
How's Mrs. Fowler handling this?

613
00:57:06,193 --> 00:57:09,558
- Dr. Fowler!
- Please! No more questions.

614
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:11,522
Can you believe this?

615
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:14,958
I ask those idiots to leave
and no one budges, not one.

616
00:57:15,163 --> 00:57:17,289
What are we supposed to do,
make them sandwiches?

617
00:57:17,498 --> 00:57:20,590
- What are you asking for?
- What?

618
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:24,255
If you want them to leave,
tell them to leave.

619
00:57:27,336 --> 00:57:30,895
- Okay, I'll tell them to leave.
- Good.

620
00:57:40,776 --> 00:57:42,766
They never come up
to the standard.

621
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:45,944
And so they're always
disappointed. Always.

622
00:57:46,145 --> 00:57:49,135
They're never doing enough
or working hard enough...

623
00:57:49,346 --> 00:57:52,313
they never behaved right enough,
were never a good enough father...

624
00:57:52,514 --> 00:57:55,880
or husband. And not only can
they not please themselves...

625
00:57:56,082 --> 00:57:59,175
sad to say, nobody else
can please them either.

626
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:19,821
- You slept late. For you.
- Yeah, I took one of your pills.

627
00:58:20,894 --> 00:58:23,293
You never do that.

628
00:58:26,163 --> 00:58:29,290
Well, there it is
in black and white.

629
00:58:29,665 --> 00:58:33,191
You should read some of the
things he says. It's unbelievable.

630
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:43,899
I'd better be going.

631
00:58:44,672 --> 00:58:46,639
Where? It's Saturday.

632
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:51,171
There's some stuff I have
to catch up on at the office.

633
00:58:52,043 --> 00:58:54,339
I won't be long.

634
00:59:15,853 --> 00:59:18,479
Do you want your receipt?

635
00:59:23,057 --> 00:59:25,024
Natalie?

636
00:59:31,294 --> 00:59:34,819
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

637
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:38,888
Not at all.

638
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:41,496
Could you break a 50, please?

639
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:44,727
Excuse me.

640
00:59:55,072 --> 00:59:58,403
Thank you, dear.
Could I possibly have another bag?

641
00:59:58,606 --> 01:00:00,163
Sure.

642
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:12,509
Yeah, well, I was just...

643
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,809
Just wondering how you're doing.

644
01:00:17,015 --> 01:00:19,448
I tried to reach you.

645
01:00:25,286 --> 01:00:27,684
We're at my mom's house now.

646
01:00:29,487 --> 01:00:33,819
- I wanted to call you.
- No, that's... It's okay.

647
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:39,290
Dr. Fowler, I...

648
01:00:42,027 --> 01:00:44,585
Yeah, I know.

649
01:00:51,465 --> 01:00:54,091
I didn't lie.

650
01:00:55,699 --> 01:01:00,327
I didn't lie the first time.
It was...

651
01:01:03,137 --> 01:01:06,104
It's how it came out.

652
01:01:11,974 --> 01:01:14,203
Mrs. Fowler?

653
01:01:16,576 --> 01:01:19,203
Can I get a pack of Marlboro Reds?

654
01:01:44,722 --> 01:01:46,951
How are the boys?

655
01:01:47,858 --> 01:01:49,916
They all right?

656
01:01:58,195 --> 01:02:00,025
I gotta go.

657
01:02:01,064 --> 01:02:02,621
I'll see you.

658
01:02:15,637 --> 01:02:18,036
So how much of this is yours?

659
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:20,728
You ask me that every time.

660
01:02:20,939 --> 01:02:23,566
You know the cove
on the other side of the cabin?

661
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:28,800
All the way to the other shoreline.
Almost 350 acres.

662
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,374
Know what it went for
when I bought it?

663
01:02:31,644 --> 01:02:33,634
You don't want to know.

664
01:02:41,649 --> 01:02:45,014
Oh, and that's little Charles
down at the pool.

665
01:02:45,217 --> 01:02:48,309
He figured out how to get down
to the pool on the elevator...

666
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:50,349
by himself.

667
01:02:50,553 --> 01:02:53,350
You must have been very proud.

668
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:57,819
That's Shannon waiting in line for,
Oh, my God, that roller coaster.

669
01:02:58,023 --> 01:03:01,889
- You know that one? My God.
- Were the lines very long?

670
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:06,415
Sometimes.
60 minutes and upwards.

671
01:03:06,628 --> 01:03:11,619
Unless, of course,
you got the... FastPass.

672
01:03:12,264 --> 01:03:14,730
What's the FastPass?

673
01:03:14,998 --> 01:03:19,626
Well, you know, you got all
these different kingdoms there.

674
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:23,359
So you take this FastPass.
It's kind of a laminated card.

675
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:26,764
You put into a machine, and
it tells you when to come back so...

676
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:31,267
so, you know, you don't have to wait
in line. You just go right in and...

677
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:33,970
You guys ever go to Florida?

678
01:03:38,409 --> 01:03:41,433
How many grandchildren
do you have now?

679
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:50,579
Well, all right, there's little
Charles and Shannon...

680
01:03:51,215 --> 01:03:55,546
the three older ones,
and the babies...

681
01:03:58,852 --> 01:04:00,716
That's eleven.

682
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:03,452
It must be wonderful.

683
01:04:04,121 --> 01:04:08,021
Willis always says, "I guess
there's no danger of us dying off".

684
01:04:24,441 --> 01:04:26,874
I'm so sorry, Ruth.

685
01:04:27,843 --> 01:04:30,140
I just wasn't thinking.

686
01:04:30,812 --> 01:04:33,439
I wanted to have more.

687
01:04:33,847 --> 01:04:36,406
But we had Frank, and...

688
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,850
Matt was just starting
his practice.

689
01:04:42,353 --> 01:04:44,843
So I guess it made sense.

690
01:04:55,793 --> 01:04:57,818
Little Charles.

691
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,287
Only got half a cord of oak
left at home...

692
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,395
and you know how much
that Daniels charges.

693
01:05:03,598 --> 01:05:05,532
At least I can stack this up
to the cabin...

694
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:08,133
have something to burn this fall.

695
01:05:15,339 --> 01:05:19,330
It's a wonderful product and
they treat you pretty good.

696
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,668
Because of selling Mary Kay
we got the new Subaru.

697
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:26,004
The ride up was very comfortable.
It's a nice car.

698
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:29,908
It's not really a car, it's got
4-wheel drive. It's a little SUV.

699
01:05:30,115 --> 01:05:34,278
- What the hell is all that SUV crap?
- Sports Utility Vehicle.

700
01:05:34,485 --> 01:05:38,249
It's a little jeep. SUV!

701
01:05:38,553 --> 01:05:41,885
And ATV, and KFC...

702
01:05:42,089 --> 01:05:46,387
- What's with all these, these...?
- Acronyms.

703
01:05:46,592 --> 01:05:50,617
I guess it's just too much trouble
to say what something is anymore.

704
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:54,592
- What does PMS stand for?
- All right, I was an army brat.

705
01:05:54,797 --> 01:05:58,731
I grew up with jeeps.
Willy's uncomfortable...

706
01:05:58,933 --> 01:06:02,629
that I know more about one
masculine thing than he does.

707
01:06:02,835 --> 01:06:04,631
Only one?

708
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,730
- Thanks, buddy.
- I like this guy.

709
01:06:18,712 --> 01:06:21,441
You've done a nice job
up here, Katie.

710
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,912
Don't tell me you made
these curtains.

711
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:27,739
- Is that antique linen?
- Well, sort of.

712
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:30,783
They're pillowcases
from our first house.

713
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:35,751
I've saved every knickknack
and whim-wham we've ever had.

714
01:06:35,956 --> 01:06:38,116
You included.

715
01:06:58,136 --> 01:07:00,365
My timing is off.

716
01:07:19,782 --> 01:07:23,683
Of course, he don't like working
in recruitment anymore.

717
01:07:23,885 --> 01:07:26,409
Them boys come
to the office in the mall.

718
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:29,884
They get half-processed, and
they opt for that "delayed entry".

719
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:33,353
- I couldn't do it.
- Or they decide not to join up.

720
01:07:33,558 --> 01:07:37,357
Like that one kid there. He had
him all the way through the works.

721
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:39,655
Christ.

722
01:07:39,862 --> 01:07:43,126
The boy's folks called.

723
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:45,161
Called David and said
the boy was...

724
01:07:45,366 --> 01:07:49,425
He wanted out so bad that he...
he'd taken his own life.

725
01:07:49,868 --> 01:07:52,097
Something like that gets to you.

726
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:54,728
Christ, I couldn't do it.

727
01:08:11,248 --> 01:08:13,272
I'm going now.

728
01:08:17,585 --> 01:08:20,246
Are you looking forward
to going back?

729
01:08:24,023 --> 01:08:26,217
You look nice.

730
01:09:56,947 --> 01:10:00,210
That was very good.
I goofed up a little bit, but...

731
01:10:31,135 --> 01:10:32,965
Ruth?

732
01:10:36,305 --> 01:10:38,238
It comes in waves...

733
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,934
and then nothing.

734
01:10:43,809 --> 01:10:46,276
Like a rest in music.

735
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:50,209
No sound, but so loud.

736
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:59,911
I don't know what to do.
I feel so angry!

737
01:11:02,254 --> 01:11:04,585
Louise McVey...

738
01:11:05,388 --> 01:11:10,847
lost a child a few years back.
Maybe you remember.

739
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:16,119
She had four.
It was the youngest, wasn't it?

740
01:11:17,363 --> 01:11:20,889
She told me about
a vision she had...

741
01:11:21,098 --> 01:11:24,362
when she found out
her daughter had died.

742
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:28,297
She saw herself at a great
distance from the Earth...

743
01:11:28,504 --> 01:11:32,165
and encircling it,
an endless line.

744
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:34,805
As she got closer...

745
01:11:35,074 --> 01:11:40,476
she saw that it was made up
of mothers traveling forward.

746
01:11:41,044 --> 01:11:45,001
She felt into line and
began walking with them.

747
01:11:45,413 --> 01:11:49,405
When they reached a certain point
the line divided...

748
01:11:49,617 --> 01:11:52,107
and she said she knew...

749
01:11:52,318 --> 01:11:57,185
that all the millions of women
on her side...

750
01:11:57,388 --> 01:12:01,948
were the mothers
who had lost children.

751
01:12:10,429 --> 01:12:14,386
She seemed to find
great comfort in that.

752
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:20,627
How did the little girl die?

753
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:24,497
A drowning, some kind
of swimming accident.

754
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:41,621
The name of the game
is Texas Chase' Em.

755
01:12:41,864 --> 01:12:43,524
- Oh, jeez.
- Is there a problem?

756
01:12:43,732 --> 01:12:46,165
Why delude yourself with that crap?

757
01:12:46,367 --> 01:12:48,732
- What?
- We're not in Vegas.

758
01:12:48,935 --> 01:12:51,835
It's 5-a-card draw or 7-card stud.

759
01:12:52,037 --> 01:12:55,801
That's what I said.
5-a-card draw, jacks to open.

760
01:12:56,006 --> 01:12:58,200
- Carl?
- Asshole.

761
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:00,639
I'll bet a buck.

762
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:03,234
Raise a buck.

763
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:27,080
Say something, for chrissake.

764
01:13:28,226 --> 01:13:31,592
Quit pussyfooting around me.

765
01:13:34,063 --> 01:13:37,361
You want me to stare
at these cards all night?

766
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:56,234
"There are things of which
I may not speak.

767
01:13:58,345 --> 01:14:01,403
There are dreams that cannot die.

768
01:14:03,014 --> 01:14:07,244
There are thoughts that made
the strong heart weak...

769
01:14:08,384 --> 01:14:11,818
and bring a pallor
into the cheek...

770
01:14:12,086 --> 01:14:15,145
and a mist before the eye...

771
01:14:17,289 --> 01:14:20,849
and the words of that fatal song...

772
01:14:21,259 --> 01:14:24,352
come over me like a chill:

773
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:29,858
`A boy's will...

774
01:14:30,064 --> 01:14:32,725
is the wind's will...

775
01:14:33,332 --> 01:14:36,095
and the thoughts of youth...

776
01:14:36,301 --> 01:14:39,736
are long, long thoughts'."

777
01:14:48,142 --> 01:14:50,575
Okay, you got the two.

778
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:54,037
- I'm in there.
- I'll take one.

779
01:14:54,245 --> 01:14:56,405
Okay. I'm gonna need...

780
01:14:56,613 --> 01:14:59,046
I need them all. Three.

781
01:15:00,116 --> 01:15:03,050
- Make them good.
- They're good, all right.

782
01:16:15,929 --> 01:16:17,919
You know where we're going?

783
01:16:18,364 --> 01:16:20,025
It's a surprise.

784
01:16:57,855 --> 01:16:59,515
Matt?

785
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,525
No. I'm sorry,
that's totally unacceptable.

786
01:20:01,869 --> 01:20:04,200
Yeah, so what did he say?

787
01:20:05,705 --> 01:20:07,899
No, we can't allow that.

788
01:20:08,307 --> 01:20:12,105
- Hold on.
- Excuse me. Ryan Collit's out there.

789
01:20:12,309 --> 01:20:17,006
- His mother just brought him in.
- I'll call you later, okay?

790
01:20:20,781 --> 01:20:23,010
I'll be back at 4, Janelle.

791
01:20:27,351 --> 01:20:31,616
Sorry, Dr. Fowler, but you
just missed him. Thank you.

792
01:20:31,821 --> 01:20:34,015
I really need to see him.
He go to lunch?

793
01:20:34,223 --> 01:20:35,712
That's right.

794
01:20:41,961 --> 01:20:44,588
He's across the street.

795
01:20:44,796 --> 01:20:46,456
Thank you.

796
01:21:16,449 --> 01:21:18,712
Matt.

797
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:24,577
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

798
01:21:25,654 --> 01:21:27,621
- My assistant, Jack.
- Hi, Jack.

799
01:21:27,822 --> 01:21:29,050
Don.

800
01:21:29,257 --> 01:21:30,689
This is Ed.

801
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:34,417
Matt Fowler.
So how's everything going?

802
01:21:34,627 --> 01:21:37,788
It's okay, you know...

803
01:21:38,329 --> 01:21:43,697
I just wanted to go over
a couple of things, and...

804
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:47,660
- When you've had your lunch.
- Sure.

805
01:21:48,935 --> 01:21:52,097
We're doing everything we can,
Matt. I promise.

806
01:21:52,304 --> 01:21:54,965
- What can I do, Bill?
- There's nothing, really.

807
01:21:55,173 --> 01:21:58,504
Look, it can't be manslaughter.
There's got to be something.

808
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:01,198
Can't you find something?

809
01:22:01,409 --> 01:22:04,275
Like some piece of evidence?
Doesn't that happen?

810
01:22:04,478 --> 01:22:08,277
We're doing everything we can.
But I'm not going to lie to you.

811
01:22:08,481 --> 01:22:11,642
All we've got is Strout, and
he claims there was a struggle.

812
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:16,444
Forensics can't determine that
cause of the condition of the house.

813
01:22:17,453 --> 01:22:21,149
The best thing for you
to do is just sit tight.

814
01:22:21,356 --> 01:22:24,722
Now, we haven't thrown in the towel
yet, and you shouldn't either.

815
01:22:25,057 --> 01:22:27,991
We have two investigators
working on this case.

816
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,626
It's still a priority case for us.

817
01:22:30,828 --> 01:22:32,227
We've got leads
we're following up on...

818
01:22:32,563 --> 01:22:35,621
we've got a lot of things to do
before we wrap this up...

819
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:39,527
and we're doing the best we can
with the resources that we have.

820
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:44,258
You've gotta hang in there with us.
You have to have some confidence.

821
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:08,913
He nails these bats
above this scale...

822
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:12,177
because Bigmouth's gonna come
in with his catch, you know?

823
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:15,014
An old-timer says, "Ivan,
what the hell are you doing?"

824
01:23:15,222 --> 01:23:18,622
The old man says, "Sending a
message", and he walks out.

825
01:23:18,824 --> 01:23:22,588
I walk in, there's these damn
baseball bats up on the wall, right?

826
01:23:22,793 --> 01:23:26,057
With a big note written right
across the front of them!

827
01:23:26,763 --> 01:23:28,024
What'd it say?

828
01:23:28,230 --> 01:23:30,697
"Here's the bats,
if you got the balls."

829
01:23:36,368 --> 01:23:38,358
He never messed
with our traps again.

830
01:23:38,569 --> 01:23:40,594
Hey, Dr. Fowler.

831
01:23:41,037 --> 01:23:42,698
Hi, Tim.

832
01:23:43,472 --> 01:23:45,633
Did he ever...

833
01:23:45,841 --> 01:23:50,503
Did he ever talk to you
about what happened that day?

834
01:23:53,746 --> 01:23:55,440
I don't even see Richard anymore.

835
01:23:55,647 --> 01:23:58,308
And he'd never tell me anything
anyway. Believe me.

836
01:23:58,582 --> 01:24:03,347
Sure, sure. Of course not.
I was just wondering if...

837
01:24:03,886 --> 01:24:06,820
maybe you heard something
through the grapevine.

838
01:24:07,021 --> 01:24:09,886
Maybe one of his buddies
said something?

839
01:24:15,025 --> 01:24:18,084
I was thinking. His brothers
still work with you, right?

840
01:24:19,562 --> 01:24:21,791
They must talk.

841
01:24:23,597 --> 01:24:27,032
What I'm saying is,
if we could find something...

842
01:24:27,233 --> 01:24:30,292
just something concrete.

843
01:24:31,936 --> 01:24:35,132
It could be just
a slip of the tongue.

844
01:24:42,009 --> 01:24:44,101
I'll keep my ears open.

845
01:24:47,345 --> 01:24:49,278
Thank you.

846
01:24:49,814 --> 01:24:54,613
It's funny running into you.
Here, Dr. Fowler.

847
01:24:56,485 --> 01:24:58,577
You know, well...

848
01:25:26,136 --> 01:25:28,865
I was hoping we could talk.

849
01:25:29,839 --> 01:25:31,635
I...

850
01:25:33,007 --> 01:25:37,874
I wanted to tell you
how truly sorry I am...

851
01:25:39,344 --> 01:25:41,175
and...

852
01:25:41,645 --> 01:25:45,478
if there's anything
that I can ever...

853
01:25:46,382 --> 01:25:49,372
do to...

854
01:25:51,486 --> 01:25:54,249
talk with you...

855
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:31,241
I better get back to the grind.
Don't steal anything.

856
01:26:31,443 --> 01:26:33,377
Hello, Mrs. Fowler.

857
01:26:39,181 --> 01:26:41,706
- Anything else?
- A pack of Marlboro Lights.

858
01:26:41,916 --> 01:26:43,178
Sure.

859
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:53,222
Now, that will be $ 14,95
with the cigarettes.

860
01:27:00,494 --> 01:27:02,121
Thank you.

861
01:27:13,136 --> 01:27:15,160
How did it go today?

862
01:27:30,146 --> 01:27:32,613
- Something wrong?
- Wrong?

863
01:27:32,948 --> 01:27:35,074
What could be wrong, Matt?

864
01:27:55,628 --> 01:27:59,927
- What do you want?
- I want to know what's going on.

865
01:28:00,132 --> 01:28:01,621
Right.

866
01:28:01,832 --> 01:28:06,028
You're obviously upset. Is there
something we can talk about?

867
01:28:06,869 --> 01:28:09,860
Talk? Who, us?

868
01:28:10,071 --> 01:28:12,004
What if somebody walked in?

869
01:28:12,205 --> 01:28:15,401
They wouldn't recognize us. They'd
think they were in the wrong house.

870
01:28:16,942 --> 01:28:20,570
- Do you want to talk or not?
- You mean about our dead son?

871
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:26,541
We haven't before.
Why should we bother now?

872
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,576
What can I do, Ruth?

873
01:28:31,084 --> 01:28:32,846
Forget it, Matt.

874
01:28:33,452 --> 01:28:35,885
Why don't you just go?

875
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,950
What do you want from me?

876
01:28:38,155 --> 01:28:41,385
I want you to stop acting
like nothing's happened.

877
01:28:41,591 --> 01:28:43,717
That's what I want.

878
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:48,651
- Because I'm not bouncing off the walls?
- That would require feelings.

879
01:28:49,295 --> 01:28:51,592
We don't want you
to hurt yourself.

880
01:28:51,797 --> 01:28:56,425
Do me a favor. You want a grieving
contest, go find someone else.

881
01:28:58,734 --> 01:29:02,169
I know how you grieve.
Go have another beer.

882
01:29:04,304 --> 01:29:07,033
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

883
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:09,439
What do you know?

884
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:13,406
You know nothing.
You don't know what I go through.

885
01:29:14,911 --> 01:29:18,846
No, I don't know what you go through
or if you go through anything!

886
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:22,612
But that's your choice,
dear, not mine.

887
01:29:24,217 --> 01:29:27,412
You're right. My choice is
not to scream at the world.

888
01:29:27,619 --> 01:29:30,587
Maybe one of us
has to be reasonable here.

889
01:29:30,787 --> 01:29:32,413
Reasonable?

890
01:29:32,688 --> 01:29:34,178
Gee, Matt...

891
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:38,051
I don't know about you,
but I miss my son.

892
01:29:39,026 --> 01:29:41,220
I'm glad you have time for reason.

893
01:29:41,427 --> 01:29:44,793
That's what you imparted to Frank,
that sense and reason.

894
01:29:45,429 --> 01:29:48,056
He thought you were
very reasonable.

895
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,599
What are you talking about?

896
01:29:55,737 --> 01:29:57,431
Nothing.

897
01:30:02,674 --> 01:30:05,301
Are you saying that I...

898
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:10,370
that I'm the one responsible?

899
01:30:12,146 --> 01:30:14,943
Is that it? Well...

900
01:30:15,915 --> 01:30:21,112
let me tell you something. Let me
tell you: you got it backwards!

901
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:24,549
I know what you think,
that I was too lenient!

902
01:30:24,755 --> 01:30:27,916
- That I let him get away with...
- Everything!

903
01:30:28,123 --> 01:30:29,647
Everything!

904
01:30:29,858 --> 01:30:33,257
- And why didn't he come to you?
- He wouldn't listen to me!

905
01:30:33,459 --> 01:30:36,359
- No, he wouldn't!
- He didn't trust me.

906
01:30:36,561 --> 01:30:39,051
- Because you never listened to him.
- No, but you did.

907
01:30:39,263 --> 01:30:43,028
You were winking at him the
whole time. You encouraged him.

908
01:30:43,232 --> 01:30:45,257
You wanted what he had. Her.

909
01:30:45,467 --> 01:30:49,060
- My God, you've gotta be kidding!
- You know it!

910
01:30:49,269 --> 01:30:52,829
You wanted it and you couldn't get
it. That's why you didn't stop him.

911
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:55,905
So you could get your kicks
through your son.

912
01:30:56,273 --> 01:30:58,866
You can't admit the truth
to me or to yourself...

913
01:30:59,075 --> 01:31:02,134
that Frank died for your
fantasy piece of ass!

914
01:31:06,313 --> 01:31:10,304
You want to know why our son
is dead? You really want to know?

915
01:31:10,949 --> 01:31:16,283
He was with her not because of me.
He went there because of you.

916
01:31:16,787 --> 01:31:20,585
Yes, he did.
Because you are so controlling...

917
01:31:20,789 --> 01:31:23,518
so overbearing...

918
01:31:24,958 --> 01:31:29,689
so angry that he was it!
That he was our only one.

919
01:31:29,895 --> 01:31:33,090
- That is not true!
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

920
01:31:33,563 --> 01:31:37,623
Even when he was a kid, you were
telling him how he was always wrong.

921
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:44,565
I remember. One time you yanked
him out of a Little League game...

922
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:46,600
and sent him home...

923
01:31:46,805 --> 01:31:49,705
for throwing his glove
in the dirt.

924
01:31:50,307 --> 01:31:53,742
He was what? 9 years old!

925
01:32:03,282 --> 01:32:06,910
Everything he did was wrong.

926
01:32:10,052 --> 01:32:13,885
Well, what was wrong
with him, Ruth?

927
01:32:21,293 --> 01:32:26,752
You're... you're so unforgiving.

928
01:32:27,597 --> 01:32:31,326
You are. That's what he said.

929
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:39,364
And you're pulling
the same shit with me.

930
01:32:39,571 --> 01:32:42,835
And that's a horrible way to be.
It's horrible.

931
01:32:44,807 --> 01:32:47,331
You're bitter, Ruth.

932
01:32:48,043 --> 01:32:50,169
Point your finger at me
all you like...

933
01:32:50,377 --> 01:32:53,345
but take a damn good look
at yourself.

934
01:33:04,919 --> 01:33:09,150
I just wanted to talk about
what happened, Matt.

935
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:15,556
You want me to be open with you,
embrace you?

936
01:33:16,494 --> 01:33:18,791
You scare me.

937
01:33:19,662 --> 01:33:22,357
How can I talk to you?
Sometimes I...

938
01:33:22,564 --> 01:33:25,327
Sometimes I can't even look at you.

939
01:33:34,371 --> 01:33:36,270
God.

940
01:33:41,409 --> 01:33:44,002
That's probably the police.

941
01:33:50,281 --> 01:33:53,807
Hi. I'm Kristen Gellar from the
Rockland Gymnastics Association.

942
01:33:54,017 --> 01:33:55,847
We're selling brand-name candy.

943
01:33:56,051 --> 01:33:58,712
Each purchase is matched
by the Tandy Corporation...

944
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,149
to help us meet our goal
of traveling to Oahu...

945
01:34:01,355 --> 01:34:04,448
to compete in the
East/West conference.

946
01:34:04,657 --> 01:34:07,284
Okay, I'll take some.

947
01:34:07,492 --> 01:34:11,790
Oh, and today we have a special.
Six bars for ten dollars.

948
01:34:11,995 --> 01:34:14,724
Okay, I'll do that.

949
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:22,464
- Should I hold something?
- Could you hold this? Thank you.

950
01:34:25,937 --> 01:34:28,768
- Okay, there's the ten.
- Thank you.

951
01:34:29,338 --> 01:34:31,498
Here.
You can pick anything you want.

952
01:34:31,706 --> 01:34:33,537
Any six?

953
01:34:44,148 --> 01:34:45,944
Ruth...

954
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:53,111
what I said just now...

955
01:34:53,954 --> 01:34:55,921
I...

956
01:34:56,923 --> 01:34:59,789
I had no right.

957
01:35:01,325 --> 01:35:03,519
No one...

958
01:35:04,394 --> 01:35:08,351
No one should ever have
to hear stuff like that.

959
01:35:11,031 --> 01:35:13,590
I'm so sorry.

960
01:35:21,004 --> 01:35:23,130
It's okay.

961
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,434
You're right, Matt.

962
01:35:27,641 --> 01:35:31,132
I am horrible.

963
01:35:31,344 --> 01:35:34,800
Please, please, please don't.

964
01:35:39,782 --> 01:35:41,841
I don't blame you.

965
01:35:43,952 --> 01:35:46,010
It's just...

966
01:35:47,154 --> 01:35:49,781
That girl came by the school...

967
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:56,356
and I couldn't forgive her.

968
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,822
I was...

969
01:35:59,394 --> 01:36:01,861
I was so...

970
01:36:09,267 --> 01:36:11,257
I'm sorry.

971
01:36:11,468 --> 01:36:13,333
I've been so...

972
01:36:14,503 --> 01:36:17,062
I've been so angry.

973
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:19,102
That's okay.

974
01:36:21,507 --> 01:36:23,498
It's just...

975
01:36:26,378 --> 01:36:28,971
I've seen him. I keep seeing him.

976
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:31,272
I know. I...

977
01:36:31,815 --> 01:36:37,183
I know. In his room, you know,
sometimes I can swear he's there.

978
01:36:37,384 --> 01:36:40,181
And today, at a stoplight...

979
01:36:40,386 --> 01:36:42,945
...I could've sworn Frank...
- Not Frank.

980
01:36:43,989 --> 01:36:46,320
Richard.

981
01:36:47,224 --> 01:36:50,090
And I don't know what to do.

982
01:36:58,497 --> 01:37:01,124
Ruth?

983
01:37:03,334 --> 01:37:05,597
Where did you see him?

984
01:37:05,802 --> 01:37:09,566
Everywhere, Downtown,
at the market. I saw him...

985
01:37:09,771 --> 01:37:12,204
I saw him at South End.

986
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:15,635
He smiled at me, Matt.

987
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:21,076
I keep running into him.

988
01:37:21,712 --> 01:37:23,975
He smiled.

989
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:32,677
It's okay, it's okay.

990
01:38:16,146 --> 01:38:19,545
- Honey, you coming to bed now?
- Soon. Matt's still here.

991
01:38:19,747 --> 01:38:22,374
Oh, well... Well, hi, Matt.

992
01:38:22,582 --> 01:38:26,517
Honey, when you come to bed,
would you bring me my pills?

993
01:38:26,886 --> 01:38:29,911
They're on the top shelf
from where the kids were here.

994
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,350
- All right.
- Thanks, dear.

995
01:38:35,857 --> 01:38:38,791
I never thought about bail.

996
01:38:39,994 --> 01:38:43,257
I thought I wouldn't have
to worry about him for years.

997
01:38:43,829 --> 01:38:45,694
You know what I heard?

998
01:38:45,897 --> 01:38:49,923
He's tending bar up to
Old Orchard Beach for a friend.

999
01:38:50,734 --> 01:38:53,724
You notice even the worst
bastards have a friend?

1000
01:38:53,935 --> 01:38:56,459
Nobody knows him there...
If they do, they don't care.

1001
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:58,729
They drink what he mixes.

1002
01:39:02,741 --> 01:39:04,731
I hate him, Matt.

1003
01:39:04,942 --> 01:39:07,739
My boys went to school with him.
He was the same.

1004
01:39:07,944 --> 01:39:10,741
Know what he'll do?
Five years at the most.

1005
01:39:10,946 --> 01:39:12,913
Yeah, I know.

1006
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:15,274
Remember the woman
about seven years ago?

1007
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:17,745
Shot her husband and
dropped him off the bridge...

1008
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:19,974
with a 100-pound sack of cement...

1009
01:39:20,185 --> 01:39:23,153
and said the whole way through it
nobody helped her.

1010
01:39:23,354 --> 01:39:24,946
- You know where she is now?
- Where?

1011
01:39:25,154 --> 01:39:27,917
She's up to Searsport now,
a secretary.

1012
01:39:28,123 --> 01:39:32,650
And whoever helped her,
where the hell is he?

1013
01:39:40,964 --> 01:39:45,161
It'd break my heart, Matt.
It would.

1014
01:39:45,368 --> 01:39:48,530
But, you ever think about just...

1015
01:39:50,971 --> 01:39:52,961
moving away?

1016
01:39:56,141 --> 01:39:58,438
Yeah, we have.

1017
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:01,975
It wouldn't matter.

1018
01:41:48,811 --> 01:41:50,573
I'll lock up.
I'll walk you to your car.

1019
01:41:50,778 --> 01:41:53,507
- Good night. See you tomorrow.
- Wait up!

1020
01:41:53,713 --> 01:41:56,340
- Want to come over for a drink?
- No, thanks.

1021
01:41:56,549 --> 01:41:58,038
- Come on!
- Maybe some other night.

1022
01:41:58,249 --> 01:42:00,182
Just one drink!

1023
01:42:00,784 --> 01:42:02,614
Come on!

1024
01:42:03,753 --> 01:42:05,652
All right.

1025
01:42:06,755 --> 01:42:08,688
Fucking bitch!

1026
01:42:24,632 --> 01:42:26,895
What are you doing here?

1027
01:42:31,636 --> 01:42:35,935
Anything I can help you with?

1028
01:42:47,146 --> 01:42:49,046
- Don't talk.
- God.

1029
01:42:49,248 --> 01:42:52,613
Unlock the door and get in.

1030
01:42:52,816 --> 01:42:56,148
Wait just a minute.
Let's calm down.

1031
01:42:56,352 --> 01:42:58,546
All right, all right.

1032
01:42:59,721 --> 01:43:01,654
All right.

1033
01:43:11,094 --> 01:43:13,324
All right, all right.

1034
01:43:24,936 --> 01:43:26,800
Unlock it.

1035
01:43:36,777 --> 01:43:39,438
Is there anyone in your place?

1036
01:43:39,879 --> 01:43:42,312
- Not tonight.
- Good.

1037
01:43:42,547 --> 01:43:44,481
Drive there.

1038
01:43:44,848 --> 01:43:46,873
Drive slowly.

1039
01:43:47,117 --> 01:43:49,949
- Don't try to get stopped.
- All right.

1040
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:22,130
He was making it with my wife,
Dr. Fowler.

1041
01:44:31,978 --> 01:44:34,138
Don't talk.

1042
01:45:00,796 --> 01:45:03,854
Let's go to the back door.
Keep your mouth shut.

1043
01:45:13,178 --> 01:45:15,338
Turn the light on.

1044
01:45:20,249 --> 01:45:22,716
- Where's your suitcase?
- My suitcase?

1045
01:45:22,917 --> 01:45:26,283
- Yeah, where is it?
- In the bedroom closet.

1046
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:28,646
Okay, that's where we're going.

1047
01:45:28,854 --> 01:45:33,380
When you come to a door, stop
and turn the light on. Let's go.

1048
01:45:57,439 --> 01:45:59,770
There's no wall switch.

1049
01:46:00,507 --> 01:46:03,339
- Where's the light?
- By the bed.

1050
01:46:03,975 --> 01:46:05,738
Go ahead.

1051
01:46:12,848 --> 01:46:16,078
Sit down. On the bed.

1052
01:46:24,955 --> 01:46:27,253
Which closet is it?

1053
01:46:28,157 --> 01:46:30,624
Where are the suitcases?

1054
01:46:46,335 --> 01:46:48,962
I wanted to work things out
with Natalie.

1055
01:46:49,337 --> 01:46:52,828
I tried to get back together again.
But I couldn't.

1056
01:46:54,907 --> 01:46:57,898
I couldn't talk to her.
He was always with her.

1057
01:47:00,144 --> 01:47:02,839
It was an accident.
I'm going to jail.

1058
01:47:03,046 --> 01:47:05,775
If I get out, I'll be an old man.
Isn't that enough?

1059
01:47:05,981 --> 01:47:08,312
You're not going to jail.

1060
01:47:10,784 --> 01:47:13,081
Pack clothes form warm weather.

1061
01:47:18,355 --> 01:47:20,686
You're going to let me go?

1062
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:23,187
You're going to jump bail.

1063
01:47:23,992 --> 01:47:25,891
What?

1064
01:47:26,093 --> 01:47:27,720
Go ahead.

1065
01:47:27,927 --> 01:47:30,486
- Go ahead!
- All right, all right.

1066
01:47:34,065 --> 01:47:39,330
See, it's the trial. We can't go
through that, my wife and I.

1067
01:47:39,535 --> 01:47:42,367
That's why you're leaving.
I've got you a ticket.

1068
01:47:44,538 --> 01:47:48,735
My wife keeps seeing you.
I can't have that anymore.

1069
01:47:50,976 --> 01:47:53,170
Thank you, Dr. Fowler.

1070
01:48:00,481 --> 01:48:03,176
I'd go pick up my boys
and he'd be there.

1071
01:48:04,317 --> 01:48:08,081
Sometimes he spent the night.
Duncan told me.

1072
01:48:09,187 --> 01:48:11,814
- I'm sorry, Dr. Fowler.
- All right, that's enough.

1073
01:48:12,022 --> 01:48:14,785
I need some things
from the bathroom.

1074
01:48:33,801 --> 01:48:36,564
- Keep walking.
- I gotta pee.

1075
01:48:38,338 --> 01:48:40,134
Go ahead.

1076
01:49:20,597 --> 01:49:22,292
Wait.

1077
01:49:30,737 --> 01:49:31,828
Let's go.

1078
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:39,808
They'll catch me. They're
going to check passenger lists.

1079
01:49:40,009 --> 01:49:41,669
I didn't use your name.

1080
01:49:41,877 --> 01:49:45,505
They'll figure that out. I would've
done it myself if it was that easy.

1081
01:49:46,113 --> 01:49:49,512
You were alone.
We got it worked out.

1082
01:49:50,149 --> 01:49:52,116
Who's "we"?

1083
01:49:52,317 --> 01:49:54,807
Start the engine. Let's go.

1084
01:50:07,859 --> 01:50:10,793
There's no planes this time
of night, Dr. Fowler.

1085
01:50:11,295 --> 01:50:14,024
Go north on 73.

1086
01:50:15,898 --> 01:50:18,025
The airport's south.

1087
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:23,263
Someone's gonna keep you awhile.
They'll take you to the airport.

1088
01:50:25,805 --> 01:50:27,897
Turn the radio on.

1089
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:30,202
Find the game.

1090
01:50:30,407 --> 01:50:33,967
- It's after 1:00.
- They run it again.

1091
01:50:34,876 --> 01:50:37,400
No more talking.

1092
01:50:45,049 --> 01:50:48,074
Let's see, the last Red Sox player
to have a 3-home run game...

1093
01:50:48,285 --> 01:50:51,617
would've been Trot Nixon
last year in Detroit.

1094
01:50:55,656 --> 01:50:58,351
Norman had one previous to that...

1095
01:50:58,691 --> 01:51:01,682
off with a fast ball, ball one.

1096
01:51:01,893 --> 01:51:06,919
He holds to get back at first, the
out fields wing around to their left.

1097
01:51:07,130 --> 01:51:09,825
And a ground ball roll
at a stretch stop.

1098
01:51:10,032 --> 01:51:14,831
Flip to second before it starts
back, it's four on the fourth.

1099
01:51:15,369 --> 01:51:18,632
Actually hits to a fourth
play to end the Inning.

1100
01:51:18,837 --> 01:51:20,270
6/4 to get Doug back.

1101
01:51:20,505 --> 01:51:23,735
The second the Inning is over,
Red Sox have left 7 after 6.

1102
01:51:24,007 --> 01:51:26,566
The Red Sox 7, the Braves 2...

1103
01:51:26,775 --> 01:51:30,403
on the WEPI Red Sox Radio Network.

1104
01:52:18,141 --> 01:52:21,734
6 for 10 on the home run
he had hit too.

1105
01:52:24,944 --> 01:52:26,275
Hits one into the air...

1106
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:28,275
- Turn around.
- Why?

1107
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,811
We missed it, turn around!

1108
01:53:05,904 --> 01:53:08,303
There's nothing back here,
Dr. Fowler.

1109
01:53:09,405 --> 01:53:12,635
I don't understand why we
don't just drive to the airport.

1110
01:53:13,642 --> 01:53:17,132
You don't think we'd leave
your car at the airport, do you?

1111
01:53:20,012 --> 01:53:22,377
I'll do 20 years, Dr. Fowler.

1112
01:53:22,914 --> 01:53:25,279
I'll be 53 years old.

1113
01:53:27,017 --> 01:53:30,143
That's a year younger
than I am now.

1114
01:53:35,822 --> 01:53:37,880
Where are we?

1115
01:53:38,357 --> 01:53:40,586
Almost there.

1116
01:53:48,162 --> 01:53:50,789
Turn it off. Leave the lights on.

1117
01:53:54,533 --> 01:53:59,059
- Is this your cabin, Dr. Fowler?
- No, it isn't. Let's get the bags.

1118
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:22,243
- Mr. Grinnel.
- I'll get them, son.

1119
01:54:26,053 --> 01:54:27,452
Wait.

1120
01:54:32,257 --> 01:54:34,315
You can take this.

1121
01:54:50,135 --> 01:54:51,965
Matt!

1122
01:54:59,206 --> 01:55:02,732
What did you do?
This isn't what we talked about.

1123
01:55:06,844 --> 01:55:08,505
He...

1124
01:55:11,348 --> 01:55:13,781
He tried to run.

1125
01:55:16,985 --> 01:55:20,384
We were going to wait
and take him out in the woods.

1126
01:55:26,924 --> 01:55:29,289
I couldn't wait.

1127
01:55:36,730 --> 01:55:38,993
I better get the ATV.

1128
01:56:32,731 --> 01:56:34,425
Wait.

1129
01:56:53,911 --> 01:56:56,344
Come on, we gotta go.

1130
01:57:44,308 --> 01:57:45,741
Come on, go!

1131
01:58:21,131 --> 01:58:23,497
What time is it?

1132
01:58:25,167 --> 01:58:27,691
It's 10 to 4.

1133
01:58:28,370 --> 01:58:31,236
We lost an hour, I'm sorry.

1134
01:58:31,604 --> 01:58:34,766
Yeah. High tide.

1135
01:58:36,074 --> 01:58:38,871
Can't stop people from fishing,
Matt.

1136
01:58:39,576 --> 01:58:42,908
- Fucking bridge.
- I'm sorry, Willis.

1137
01:58:49,349 --> 01:58:51,839
Stopped into his little
shed there once.

1138
01:58:52,617 --> 01:58:54,881
Place reeked.

1139
01:58:55,319 --> 01:58:57,980
He's spilled more whiskey
than we've ever drunk.

1140
01:58:59,556 --> 01:59:02,456
We'll just pray he's already
three sheets to the wind.

1141
01:59:07,727 --> 01:59:10,524
Katie's pill will be
wearing off soon.

1142
02:02:53,567 --> 02:02:55,625
Did you do it?

1143
02:03:37,627 --> 02:03:40,151
Are you all right, Matt?

1144
02:03:51,169 --> 02:03:55,160
There was a picture of him
and Natalie on the wall.

1145
02:04:03,210 --> 02:04:05,507
What is it, Matt?

1146
02:04:10,547 --> 02:04:13,106
The way she was smiling.

1147
02:04:17,085 --> 02:04:18,813
What?

1148
02:04:25,556 --> 02:04:27,990
I don't know.

1149
02:04:38,599 --> 02:04:40,395
Matt...

1150
02:04:59,744 --> 02:05:02,110
What am I thinking?

1151
02:05:03,447 --> 02:05:05,880
You must be hungry.

1152
02:05:29,163 --> 02:05:30,721
Matt!

1153
02:05:34,533 --> 02:05:36,228
Matt?

1154
02:05:36,801 --> 02:05:39,132
Do you want coffee?
