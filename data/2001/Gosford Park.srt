1
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,628
Don't just stand there,
give me a hand with the canopy.

2
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,198
- Mary? Merriman? Are you ready?
- Mary?

3
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,072
Yes, Mr. Burkett.

4
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,832
Everything's ready, my Lady.

5
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,557
- I think she's knocking.
- Well, see what she wants.

6
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,074
I can't open this wretched thing.

7
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,391
I suppose we'd better stop.

8
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,112
I can't get this top off.

9
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,990
Is everything all right?

10
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,679
Are you okay?

11
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,788
- Am I what?
- We're all right, thank you.

12
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,473
Is that Lady Trentham?

13
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,755
Lady Trentham.

14
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,316
I'm William McCordle's
cousin, Ivor.

15
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,395
Ivor Novello.

16
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,673
Yes, of course.

17
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,949
May I introduce a friend of mine

18
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,199
- from California, Morris Weissman.
- Hello.

19
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,193
We were wondering if
we were headed in

20
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,833
the same direction.

21
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,393
I dare say we might be.

22
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,834
If everything seems to
be all right...

23
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,995
Bye.

24
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,795
Could we get on
before I freeze to death?

25
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,239
- Was that really Ivor Novello?
- Yes. Could we get on?

26
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,673
Hello. Nice house.

27
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,519
I like your house.

28
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,715
Hello, Ivor.

29
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,995
Welcome back, Your Ladyship.

30
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,838
Constance, welcome.

31
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,675
Hello, dear.

32
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,316
If he uses my Christian name,
why not make it "Aunt Constance"?

33
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,393
I'm not the upstairs maid.

34
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,715
He's still got

35
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,229
- that vile little dog.
- The ones we hate last forever.

36
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,954
- Did you have a horrid journey?
- Yes, fairly horrid.

37
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,312
Take the car round back
to unload it.

38
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,518
Follow him. Mrs. Wilson
will look after you.

39
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,709
Your Ladyship.

40
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,669
Your Lordship.

41
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,797
- Louisa.
- William.

42
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,274
- Raymond.
- William.

43
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,516
- Lots of good shooting coming.
- That's what we're here for.

44
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,476
Leave everything in one pile.

45
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,035
Make sure it's labelled.
It'll go up in the luggage lift.

46
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,800
- Where's the gun room?
- Down there on the right.

47
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,355
The keeper'll show you what to do.

48
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,709
- I know what to do.
- Ellen.

49
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,399
What are you doing over there?

50
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,239
Take that rain off the cases.

51
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,235
Those are Mr. Novello's bags.

52
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,676
- Who are you?
- I'm Mr. Weissman's man.

53
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,036
- The Countess of Trentham.
- Make sure they're labelled.

54
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,595
- Where am I?
- In the stable block.

55
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,876
Her Ladyship is in
the Chinese Room.

56
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,035
Elsie.

57
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,835
You share with the head housemaid.
She'll show you where things are.

58
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,474
This is Miss Trentham.
Take care of her.

59
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,275
My name's Mary Maceachran.

60
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,397
Not here. It's Trentham.

61
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,995
- Lord Stockbridge. Guns.
- Down there on the right.

62
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,277
- The name's Robert Parks.
- Mr. Parks,

63
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,479
below stairs you're Mr. Stockbridge.

64
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,150
- Is that so?
- I knew a Mr. Parks in Norwich.

65
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,432
- Is he any relation?
- No. London born and bred.

66
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,719
- And Her Ladyship's jewels?
- It's this way.

67
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,113
George is in charge of the safe.
Watch where he puts his hands.

68
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,757
Have you got the ones for tonight?

69
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,548
Sorry.

70
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,198
Always bring a separate box
for the first night.

71
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,597
- Freddie, do wait.
- What is it this time?

72
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,038
- Does my hair look all right?
- It looks fine.

73
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,798
Why are we...?

74
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,433
We're not late.

75
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,790
Please stop going on.

76
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,869
Isobel?

77
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,919
- Hello.
- Hello.

78
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,237
See you in there. There's something
I've been meaning to say to you.

79
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,312
Have you spoken to your father?

80
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,377
No.

81
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,512
"No"? You promised.

82
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,075
I said I'd do my best.

83
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,635
You're beautiful when you resist.

84
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,310
- Stop it. I'll ask him tonight.
- You bloody well better.

85
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,793
- Don't sneak up on people.
- Don't worry, it's nobody.

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,228
Sorry, Miss Isobel.

87
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,073
Will you have a chance to speak

88
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,236
- to him tonight?
- Stop going on about it.

89
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,759
That's all very well...

90
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,837
I think it's ridiculous.
I'm here to shoot.

91
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,999
It's a relief to sit next to
someone who isn't deaf in one ear.

92
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,474
I'm sorry?

93
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,110
- I have a dog.
- What's his name?

94
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,230
Sam.

95
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,159
Darling, what do you mean
"leave it"?

96
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,756
Let it come naturally.

97
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,911
Don't try and steer
the conversation.

98
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,472
- Makes you sound desperate.
- I am fucking desperate.

99
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,277
My brother-in-law, Lord Stockbridge.

100
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,948
- Hello. I'm Morris Weissman.
- Who?

101
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,314
- Morris Weissman.
- Weissman.

102
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,316
Yes.

103
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,669
You can go and sit down now.

104
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,993
Elsie, this is
Lord Stockbridge's valet.

105
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,316
He's new here, so show him around.

106
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,599
- You share with Mr. Weissman's man.
- Has His Lordship's luggage gone up?

107
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,473
Supposedly. He's in the
Tapestry Room.

108
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,390
Oh well, here we go again.

109
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,272
That's just it.
I've never done a house party.

110
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,277
Not properly.

111
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,239
How come you got taken on
if you've got no experience?

112
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,509
She wants to train me.

113
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,871
- She didn't care about experience.
- She didn't want to pay for it.

114
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,595
- It's cold here.
- You should pack your woollies.

115
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,355
Here we are.

116
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,389
- Everything all right, Elsie?
- Fine, Miss Lewis. Thanks.

117
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,669
That's your bed there.

118
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,668
That good? Yeah, very nice.

119
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,791
I shall go in the library.

120
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,708
Here you are, Pip.

121
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,075
Pardon, sir. I thought I'd take
The Times up in case you wanted to

122
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,919
- read it while dressing.
- Thank you, Robert. Look after Pip.

123
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,270
- Of course, sir.
- There's a good boy.

124
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,438
I have to call California
and I can't find...

125
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,392
There's a phone on the left.

126
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,279
Thank you. Of course
I'll reverse the charges.

127
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,475
Yes.

128
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,556
There's a new restaurant
on the Strand.

129
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,150
It's open 24 hours a day.
You can go in day or night.

130
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,312
Who's the funny little American?

131
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,875
Morris Weissman.
He's a friend of Ivor.

132
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,911
He makes films in Hollywood.

133
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,515
Ivor asked if he could bring him.
Didn't see why not.

134
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,280
He might be interested in
guns and shooting.

135
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,034
Never mind. He adds glamour
to the gathering.

136
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,597
I didn't expect anything
half as exotic. Not for me.

137
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,839
- You know I hate whisky.
- Drink it. Do you good.

138
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,268
Really, Bill.
You're such a bad influence.

139
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,111
Don't blame me if I misbehave.

140
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,713
I don't know how your husband
is impressed with Hollywood folk.

141
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,078
You know Raymond.

142
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,077
He only feels safe
with his own kind.

143
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,315
Bill!

144
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,114
- Ladies' maids never wear aprons.
- Her Ladyship used to have

145
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,993
a French one who wore
a black one like this.

146
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,156
- She thinks it's got style.
- I bet she does.

147
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,032
I bet she took it
out of your wages, too.

148
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,511
She likes everything just so.

149
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,273
Don't they all.

150
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,078
- That's him.
- Who?

151
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,919
Ivor Novello.

152
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,312
He passed us on his way here
and he spoke to me.

153
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,554
He spoke to Her Ladyship
but I answered.

154
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,438
I cut it out for Garbo. I prefer
American stars. More oomph.

155
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,549
Go on!

156
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,716
- Is he really Sir William's cousin?
- Yeah.

157
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,194
A film star in the family.
Lady Sylvia must be thrilled.

158
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,198
- I don't think.
- Why wouldn't she be?

159
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,234
Because she's a snobbish cow.

160
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,149
She looks down on those who
got to the top with hard work.

161
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,828
She looks down on her husband,
except when it's time to pay,

162
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,837
then she's got her hand out.

163
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,519
What was her family, then?

164
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,593
What you'd expect really.
Toffee-nosed and useless.

165
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,955
Her father was the Earl of Carton.
Didn't have a pot to piss in.

166
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,518
What's she like to work for?

167
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,676
She's horrible, but he's...

168
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,156
he's okay. Come on,
we better get cracking.

169
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,830
- Hello. I'm Ivor.
- I know who you are.

170
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,600
- Mabel Nesbitt.
- Hello, Mabel.

171
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,596
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

172
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,671
I don't smoke. Thank you.

173
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,919
Mrs. Nesbitt's only got
one dress with her.

174
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,997
She says her husband rushed her
when she was packing.

175
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,597
- Do you look after visitors?
- Sometimes Dorothy helps.

176
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,872
Why Mrs. Wilson make the
still room do it beats me.

177
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,151
I think she only does it
to annoy Mrs. Croft.

178
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,920
- Which one does Dorothy answer to?
- Both. That's the problem.

179
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,789
She's rushed off her feet.

180
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,672
- Nearly done there?
- Here's Miss Bossy.

181
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,199
Here, this is you.

182
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,352
What was Greta Garbo really like?

183
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,872
- Did you get to know her?
- Yes, I did, actually.

184
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,552
She's staying with me next month.

185
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,673
Tell me, how much longer

186
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,075
are you going to make films?

187
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,871
Depends on how much longer
the public wants to see me in them.

188
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,597
It must be hard to know when
it's time to throw in the towel.

189
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,509
What a pity

190
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,995
about that last one of yours.

191
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,395
What was it called?
"The Dodger"?

192
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,469
"The Lodger".

193
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,709
"The Lodger".

194
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,271
It must be disappointing
when something

195
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,596
flops like that.

196
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,149
Yes, it is.

197
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,273
Rather disappointing.

198
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,958
Look at this.
Machine made lace.

199
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,310
- Hark at her.
- I hate cheap clothes.

200
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,476
They're twice the work
and never look as good.

201
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,756
I'll murder that dog one day.
Look, all over his waistcoat.

202
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,679
What do you expect from
a woman with her own maid?

203
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,714
Lady Lavinia says a woman travelling
with no maid has no self-respect.

204
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,919
She calls it 'giving in'

205
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,633
I haven't 'given in'

206
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,032
- That's different.
- Why?

207
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,275
What's your name?

208
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,439
I think here I'm called Trentham.

209
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,753
No, I meant your real name.

210
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,430
Mary. Mary Maceachran.

211
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,715
Blimey. What does
Your Ladyship call you?

212
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,350
She should call me Maceachran

213
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,869
now I'm a lady's maid.
That's what my mother says.

214
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,918
But she can't pronounce it
so she calls me Mary.

215
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,109
I don't blame her.

216
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,995
Sylvia.

217
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,678
There mustn't be any more nonsense.

218
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,438
I don't know what you mean.

219
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,152
Done much shooting this year?

220
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,475
Quite a lot.

221
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,714
- Does Louisa go out with you?
- Usually.

222
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,509
It's very good of her.

223
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,359
Don't do that. It's bad

224
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,118
for him. Put him down.

225
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,914
Bores me stiff.

226
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,519
All right, Pip.

227
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,913
William's a bad shot. I duck out,
particularly in Scotland.

228
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,038
I'm rather fond of Scotland.

229
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,272
Get on with your work.

230
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,639
- Mr. Weissman.
- I'm dealing with this.

231
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,439
What is it, Mr. Weissman?

232
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,950
To start with, my name
is Denton. Henry Denton.

233
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,592
You're valet to Mr. Weissman.
You'll be known as Mr. Weissman

234
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,756
below stairs.

235
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,594
We stick to old customs here.
It saves confusion.

236
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,591
It's about Mr. Weissman's diet.

237
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,109
He's a vegetarian.

238
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,556
- A what?
- A vegetarian.

239
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,348
He doesn't eat meat.

240
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,431
He eats fish, but not meat.

241
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,155
Well, I never.

242
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,479
Doesn't eat meat.
He's come for a shooting party

243
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,159
and he doesn't eat meat.

244
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,870
He doesn't intend to shoot,
but walk out for a bit of air.

245
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,789
A bit of air?

246
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,470
Thank you. We'll make arrangements.
I suggest one of the servants

247
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,511
takes you upstairs.
Mr. Weissman is in

248
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,917
the Green Bedroom. You'll share
with Lord Stockbridge's valet,

249
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,994
Robert Parks.

250
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,037
He's full of himself.
"Doesn't eat meat".

251
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,437
We don't want to be thought of
as unsophisticated, do we?

252
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,393
Mr. Weissman's an American.
They do things differently there.

253
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,309
Now give Louisa
a kiss from me.

254
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,159
Sorry, I should have

255
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,398
- made it clear Morris doesn't shoot.
- Don't worry.

256
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,559
William thinks Americans sleep
with guns under their pillows.

257
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,069
They do, but more for each other
than for killing birds.

258
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,158
Remind me. How are you
related to William exactly?

259
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,513
Our mothers were first cousins.

260
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,552
I don't believe I ever met
William's mother.

261
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,231
Didn't she do something original?

262
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,953
She was a teacher.

263
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,029
So was mine.

264
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,715
- That's marvellous, isn't it?
- Yes.

265
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,319
Sylvia is so clever.

266
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,717
She finds wonderful servants.
I don't know how she manages.

267
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,235
I'm breaking in a new maid.
I'm worn out with it.

268
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,193
Nothing more exhausting, is there?

269
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,516
I don't have a lady's maid.

270
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,638
Hello. I was just telling

271
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,276
Mabel about my new maid.
The amount of work I have to do,

272
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,516
she should be paying me.

273
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,515
- She does seem rather young.
- She is, my dear,

274
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,472
is wonderfully cheap.

275
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,836
Where are you going?
The room's this way.

276
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,276
Why did you have to mention
you don't have a maid?

277
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,397
It's easier to clean them
if you put the trees in first.

278
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,437
I was just about to do that.

279
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,994
- Are these Mr. Novello's shoes?
- Yes.

280
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,510
- Do you really live in Hollywood?
- I do.

281
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,990
How did you get there?
Where did you start from?

282
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,236
Where do you think? Scotland.

283
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,838
Were you always in service?

284
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,315
Did you ever think of
getting into films?

285
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,152
I wanted to be an actor,
when I was little.

286
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,637
I suppose old mother Trentham

287
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,559
will have her begging bowl out
while she's here.

288
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,716
She won't bother your employers.

289
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,035
Why not?

290
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,434
Because Lady Lavinia

291
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,393
- hasn't got a penny.
- And whose fault is that?

292
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,559
The commander has just been
a bit unfortunate.

293
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,992
- I'll say. I think he's pathetic.
- Then hand in your notice.

294
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,674
The other two sisters fell on
their feet. They're good-looking.

295
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,440
- Lady Sylvia's lovely.
- You think so?

296
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,276
She might have done a bit
better for herself.

297
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,110
Lord Carton wanted Sir William
for either of the two eldest.

298
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,119
- Why was Lord Carton so keen?
- Why do you think?

299
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,154
Who pays for him to swan around
Biarritz six months a year?

300
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,197
Who keeps Ma Trentham
in stockings and gin?

301
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,312
Old money-bags, that's who.

302
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,590
It's disgusting the way
they all use him.

303
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,758
The rest haven't the brains to make
the price of a packet of tea.

304
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,679
- Have you finished, Elsie?
- Yes, Mrs. Wilson.

305
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,348
- Just this hem to do.
- What's Lord Stockbridge like?

306
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,431
He thinks he's God Almighty.

307
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,389
They all do.

308
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,677
Why does this fork
go on the right?

309
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,429
They eat the fish

310
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,074
with two of them.
One in each hand.

311
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,633
Why is that then?

312
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,033
Search me.

313
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,435
What are you doing here?

314
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,156
- Just looking around.
- Mr. Jennings will be up soon.

315
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,795
If I were you, I'd look around
somewhere else.

316
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,238
- Is that what you'd do?
- Exactly what I would do.

317
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,993
Then that's what I'll do.

318
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,155
Something funny about that bloke.

319
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,749
His accent for a start.
What is his game?

320
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,189
Are you finished?

321
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,996
What about Lord Rupert Standish
and Mr. Blond?

322
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,556
Ladyship said not to lay for them.

323
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,270
It's ready if they turn up.
We'll stick on two extra places.

324
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,115
When they arrive, you'll be
dressing Mr. Blond, Arthur.

325
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,237
- Mr. Blond?
- Yes, Mr. Blond.

326
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,237
George, you'll have Lord Rupert.

327
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,236
If they're very late,
they can change by themselves

328
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,078
and you can tidy up when
they're downstairs.

329
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,759
Is Mr. Nesbitt settled?

330
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,872
I'll finish him off now, sir.

331
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,833
And Mr. Novello?

332
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,631
Mr. Weissman's man
will attend to him.

333
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,710
Right.

334
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,477
After you finish, join me in
the drawing room with the drinks.

335
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,319
What's the matter with you?

336
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,669
Nothing.

337
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,469
I thought I'd be doing
Mr. Novello.

338
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,638
You won't see him in
his underdrawers. Never mind.

339
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,279
Better luck next time.

340
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,757
They're rather a mixed bunch.

341
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,554
Mr. Weissman's very odd.
Apparently

342
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,275
he produces motion pictures.
"The Charlie Chan Mysteries".

343
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,790
Or does he direct them?
I never know the difference.

344
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,158
Really? I enjoy those, my Lady.

345
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,395
Mary.

346
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,750
It's fun having a film star here.
There's so little to talk about

347
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,757
after the first flush
of recognition.

348
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,309
Why has Nesbitt brought
that awful, common wife of his?

349
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,669
Isabel only asked him because
a gun dropped out.

350
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,316
That's no excuse to inflict her
on us all. Mary.

351
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,395
What's the gossip in the
servants' hall?

352
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,194
Nothing, my Lady.

353
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,156
Nonsense.
Come on, out with it.

354
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,389
Well...

355
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,116
Is it true that Sir William
could've married Lady Stockbridge?

356
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,114
Is that what they're saying?

357
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,151
Only that Lord Carton was after
Sir William for one of them,

358
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,759
but he didn't care which.

359
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,037
What would you say if I told you

360
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,511
they cut cards for him?

361
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,992
Lewis said you wanted me.

362
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,272
- Who's next to me at dinner?
- Aunt Constance and Lavina.

363
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,268
Why do I have that bloody old
trout all the time? I want Louisa.

364
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,439
- Do I explain the precedence again?
- I don't give a shit about that.

365
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,996
You complain people look down on you
and then behave like a peasant.

366
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,830
Tomorrow, I'll breakfast in bed,

367
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,995
and then get into the tweeds.
What shirt have you brought?

368
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,355
- The green with the pink stripe.
- No, dear, that's quite wrong.

369
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,679
Something plain for country sports.
The one I had on today will do.

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,514
- But it's soiled.
- You can wash it, can't you?

371
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,469
God.

372
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,473
I hate shooting.

373
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,075
Why does one have to do
these things?

374
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,630
Has Constance asked for money yet?

375
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,432
- No.
- Raymond says she's been complaining

376
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,393
that her allowance
isn't big enough.

377
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,392
Good mind to stop it completely.

378
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,953
I thought it was for her lifetime.

379
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,919
No, no.

380
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,113
Will that be all, sir?

381
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,194
I wish Anthony wasn't here.
Make sure I'm not

382
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,799
- left alone with him.
- Why?

383
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,911
I'm pulling out of his scheme.

384
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,955
- Have you told him?
- No, and I'm not going to either.

385
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,631
Louisa says I should leave it till
next week. Let him sob in private.

386
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,919
Say hello to your mummy. Go on.

387
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,998
Far be it from me
to contradict Louisa.

388
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,954
- Anything else, sir?
- Pip. He might fall down the stairs.

389
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,357
Come here, you.

390
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,309
Thank you Elsie. Keep hold of him.
Is everything all right?

391
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,115
Cheap dress, wrong shoes.
I'm making bricks without straw.

392
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,235
- Do have any spare hairpins?
- Yes.

393
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,799
I'm trying to get back to the room
and I can't find it.

394
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,117
- Staircase at the end of the corridor.
- Thank you.

395
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,113
Pip. Thank you, Elsie.

396
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,118
- You've got hair on your dress.
- Thank you, sir.

397
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,438
There is nothing going on
between me and Isobel.

398
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,633
Can't you just tell me the truth?
You are a liar!

399
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,478
Don't call me a liar!

400
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,197
- I found some pins, madam.
- Right.

401
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,188
- We're supposed to be downstairs.
- You go on.

402
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,793
I'll be down in a minute.

403
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,078
Try and make her look respectable.

404
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,113
Thank you.

405
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,549
Well...

406
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,438
there's no harm in trying.

407
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,669
Thank you very much, Mr. Jennings.

408
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,231
- Just Jennings, sir.
- All right, just Jennings.

409
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,513
By the way. I booked a call
to California

410
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,314
and I'd appreciate it if you'd
would get me when it comes through.

411
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,751
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you, Jennings.

412
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,876
You're providing entertainment?

413
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,757
That's how you got your invitation.

414
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,992
Don't get up. Go on, please.

415
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,270
You look lovely in that dress.

416
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,310
What is it?
I don't recognise it.

417
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,399
Just something I'm working on.

418
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,039
I can't imagine how one goes
about inventing a tune.

419
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,554
Where do you start?

420
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,239
Rather difficult to say.

421
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,712
You're too clever for words.

422
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,353
- Good evening.
- Hello.

423
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,915
- Lovely dress.
- Thank you.

424
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,756
How do you manage to put up with
these people?

425
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,389
You forget I earn my living
by impersonating them.

426
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,997
- Can I help you?
- You know...

427
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,274
I really enjoy the way
you do things, Mr. Jennings.

428
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,348
I beg you pardon!

429
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,512
- What is it, Henry?
- Nothing.

430
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,989
I just wanted to be sure
you had everything you need.

431
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,837
Yes, I do. Thank you.

432
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,998
It's wonderful to find a servant
who really shows an interest.

433
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,189
Sir.

434
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,835
- Come on. We've got 20 minutes.
- Did you put salt on the table?

435
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,477
Shuffle along. Here he comes.

436
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,998
- Satisfactory, Mr. Jennings?
- Yes, thank you, Dorothy.

437
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,909
They have their drinks. We can all
take our leisure for half an hour.

438
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,715
What's this?

439
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,559
I believe this is my place.

440
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,189
Since when did a baroness
outrank a countess?

441
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,753
Miss Trentham, would you take
the place of honour.

442
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,429
Miss Trentham?

443
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,357
I'm right here, thank you.

444
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,518
Go on. Don't keep him waiting.

445
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,832
Miss Meredith,

446
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,634
- would you come and sit on my left?
- I'm nothing

447
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,592
when there are visitors in the house.

448
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,835
I'm used to it.

449
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,871
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

450
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,997
For what we are about to receive

451
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,713
may the Lord make us
truly thankful.

452
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,036
Start when you get it.

453
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,832
No time for loitering.

454
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,956
I'm not serving tonight, am I?

455
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,628
Not tonight,

456
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,273
but probably tomorrow.

457
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,835
- Where is Mrs. Croft?
- Always eats with her own staff.

458
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,152
Does she take her pudding
to Mrs. Wilson? Our cook does that.

459
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,192
Fat chance.
They hate each other.

460
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,552
- Can I ask a question?
- Certainly, Mr. Weissman.

461
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,518
How can we help you?

462
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,799
I wondered how many people here
had parents in service?

463
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,957
And was that why they chose
to go into it?

464
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,232
An interesting question to which
I cannot provide the answer.

465
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,792
All of you whose parents were
in service raise your hand.

466
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,392
- My father was.
- Both. Nanny and groom.

467
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,389
- Not you, Dorothy?
- My father was a farmer.

468
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,397
A tenant of Lord Carton's.

469
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,669
- Mr. Meredith?
- Factory hands, both of them.

470
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,677
And if you ask me,
they were better off.

471
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,557
What about you, Mr. Stockbridge?

472
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,913
What's the matter? Don't you know?

473
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,039
Yeah, I know what they did.

474
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,200
But it didn't have any effect on me
or my choice of work.

475
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,833
- And why's that?
- Because I grew up in an orphanage.

476
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,872
Thank you, Mr. Weissman for
giving us something to think about.

477
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,628
Her Ladyship.

478
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,955
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

479
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,799
Please do sit down and
finish your supper.

480
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,470
A major crisis has arisen.
Mr. Weissman won't eat meat.

481
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,956
I can't tell Mrs. Croft.
I don't dare.

482
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,835
Everything under control.
Mr. Weissman's valet informed us,

483
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,110
so we've prepared
a special version of the soup.

484
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,835
He can eat fish, hors-d'oeuvres
and we'll have a Welsh rabbit

485
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,952
for the game course. I don't know
about the entree.

486
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,949
Thank you.
Ten steps ahead as usual!

487
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,750
Which one of you
is Mr. Weissman's valet?

488
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,958
I am. Your Ladyship.

489
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,515
Are you, indeed? Heavens.

490
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,117
Thank you for your...

491
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,273
efficiency.

492
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,433
You're all set, then.

493
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,831
- Yes, George?
- Nothing, sir.

494
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,274
I should hope not.
Very hungry.

495
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,433
Good boy.

496
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,717
I wondered if I could have a word
with you alone after dinner.

497
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,638
I can't leave my guests, can I?

498
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,028
You'll make that dog sick.

499
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,036
Isobel,

500
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,198
William and I are going
into business together in Sudan.

501
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,834
- No. I didn't know that.
- It's quite exciting.

502
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,318
There are hundreds of Sudanese
native soldiers,

503
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,715
entire regiments,
wandering around the desert

504
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,833
willy-nilly without anything
on their feet, which causes

505
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,268
some hardship, I imagine.

506
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,596
No, I grew up in Leicester.

507
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,748
- My father had a glove factory.
- Really?

508
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,714
- I do know how a glove should fit.
- Really, darling,

509
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,434
you're boring poor
Mr. Novello to death.

510
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,310
No!

511
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,192
He's going to explain it to me

512
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,038
and show me how it all works.

513
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,672
There's going to be
a pheasant hunt in my picture.

514
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,948
...modernising armies in the Sudan,
providing them with boots.

515
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,917
Aren't you cold?

516
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,157
It's better than that kitchen.

517
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,115
I though you could do with this.

518
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,912
That's kind, love.

519
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,155
Elsie, hello.

520
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,796
- Good evening. Your Lordship.
- We've got bags, guns and no man.

521
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,228
Will you sort it out?

522
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,078
- Of course, Your Lordship.
- Thank you.

523
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,272
- We'll get your bags, sir.
- Thank you. It's very kind of you.

524
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,758
In the boot, is it?

525
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,236
Can I trouble you for a light?

526
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,273
- You got that bag?
- Yeah.

527
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,750
- I've got the gun.
- Thank you.

528
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,630
You think he's losing interest
in that sort of thing?

529
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,753
Not just that, the whole Empire.
He said the steam's gone out of it.

530
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,955
William,

531
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,675
you think the Empire's finished?

532
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,348
I've been what?

533
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,832
The Empire finished after the War,
because of the War.

534
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,429
It changed everything.

535
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,959
Empire, Leicester Square?

536
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,912
I don't care what's changed or not
as long as

537
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,429
our sons are spared
what you all went through.

538
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,875
Oh, not all.

539
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,708
You didn't fight, did you, William?

540
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,753
I did my bit.

541
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,190
Well, you made a lot of money,

542
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,997
but it's not the same as charging
into the cannon's mouth, is it?

543
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,273
Thanks to Raymond the family had
one representative in the front line.

544
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,038
Raymond, tell them how many times
you were mentioned

545
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,593
in the despatches.

546
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,552
- I forget.
- No you don't. Come on.

547
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,712
- Is he being modest?
- Yes.

548
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,959
What are you doing?

549
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,994
The others have arrived.

550
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,514
If they're frightened of you
then they sense your fear.

551
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,193
Lord Standish and Mr. Blond

552
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,311
- are here.
- They can have a tray

553
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,431
in the billiard room.
They can join us later.

554
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,874
Very good, my Lady.

555
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,713
- Is Rupert here?
- Yes.

556
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,319
Shall I go and say hello?

557
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,839
I don't think so.

558
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,076
Face it. You're a younger son
with the tastes of a marquis

559
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,316
and the income of a vicar.

560
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,673
Her mother likes you.
She does, too.

561
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,356
I know she's not a show-stopper...

562
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,915
- Her father's not keen on the idea.
- He'll come round.

563
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,317
"Met my daughter,
Lady Rupert Standish?"

564
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,318
He thinks I'm in it for the money.

565
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,438
Of course, but you can't
let that put you off.

566
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,790
He's an obstacle.

567
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,468
Then you must overcome that.

568
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,114
Her Ladyship asks if you would

569
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,038
join her in the drawing room
when you've finished.

570
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,553
All right, ladies, off you go.

571
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,752
Chaps, move down.

572
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,109
Louisa,

573
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,193
look after Pip for me, will you?

574
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,073
Could we have a word
or two later, William?

575
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,750
- Jennings, could I...?
- Certainly, sir.

576
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,953
- Put them in the pantry.
- There's more in here.

577
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,950
I need all the knives.

578
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,390
She's counting again.

579
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,115
Fred? Albert? Ready?

580
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,352
- There he is.
- Who?

581
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,473
Lord Stockbridge's valet.
He grew up in an orphanage.

582
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,554
They made him shout it.
Makes you feel sorry for him.

583
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,990
Nothing to be ashamed of.

584
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,836
Shall I ask Lord Rupert and
Mr. Blond to join you, sir?

585
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,190
No. They can entertain the ladies.

586
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,073
- Give Mr. Novello a rest.
- Did I overhear you

587
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,874
saying you were going into
business with Sir William?

588
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,559
- I beg your pardon?
- Is it very old?

589
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,557
- Possibly.
- Lf you need

590
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,672
an expert in changing money,
especially Africa,

591
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,871
I'm your man.
Yes, the expert.

592
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,439
No, it's not here.

593
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,193
- Mr. Jennings doesn't have it?
- So he says.

594
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,393
If it's a silver carving knife,
he must have it.

595
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,036
It's gone in the wrong drawer
in the silver pantry.

596
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,753
That's what I told him.

597
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,353
How old would you say
Mr. Stockbridge was?

598
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,072
Thirty-one, thirty-two.

599
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,317
- Why?
- No reason.

600
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,035
I think I'll turn in.
We've got an early start.

601
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,949
And tell Mr. Jennings
we haven't got that knife.

602
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,392
- Pleasant evening, my Lady?
- Not really, no.

603
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,312
Lord Stockbridge on one side,
boring for Britain,

604
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,870
and Freddie Nesbitt on the other,
sucking up.

605
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,194
I'm worn out. Any more chocolate
in that pot?

606
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,157
I'll go down and make some more.

607
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,075
Lewis.

608
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,396
Lewis.

609
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,156
- I was looking for my maid.
- She's just gone downstairs.

610
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,988
Can I help?

611
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,357
She's fetching me chocolate,
but I wonder if I prefer milk.

612
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,396
Would that be hot milk or cold?

613
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,275
You decide.

614
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,198
I couldn't say, my Lady.

615
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,314
Hot then, with something sweet.
Your hands are in your pockets.

616
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,793
Otherwise, I'll never sleep.

617
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,517
Why? Do you have
trouble sleeping, my Lady?

618
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,755
I have a feeling I might

619
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,393
have trouble tonight.

620
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,800
I'll be wide awake at one a.m.,

621
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,672
bored to sobs.

622
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,674
Then we must try and think of
something to amuse you.

623
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,155
Barnes.

624
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,794
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- It's all right, it's fine.

625
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,231
I knew William would try
something like this. Fuck him.

626
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,390
Short arse.

627
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,192
And fuck this room.

628
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,670
You should come with me tomorrow.
I'll say I need you.

629
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,995
I got through to
the coast, finally.

630
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,599
Is that clock right?

631
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,877
We got turned down
by Una Merkel, so...

632
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,678
Sheehan's pushing for a rewrite.

633
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,798
He thinks the part's too small.

634
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,756
It's a Charlie Chan picture,
not a movie about a socialite.

635
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,949
So...

636
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,393
will I see you later?

637
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,828
I don't think I should
risk it, do you?

638
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,554
Good night, sir.

639
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,909
Henry.

640
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,636
Don't forget those.
They'll think you don't care.

641
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,436
- I took the wrong stairs.
- You better not be seen up here.

642
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,756
- I'd better go down.
- Why? There's no rush.

643
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,318
Since you're here now,

644
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,199
what about a drink?

645
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,194
What are you doing?

646
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,234
Get off me!

647
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,193
Get off me!

648
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,076
What?

649
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,875
What's this?

650
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,108
What are you doing here?

651
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,272
I took the wrong staircase, I was
waiting till the coast was clear.

652
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,357
Go down before anyone catches you.
Just a minute.

653
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,949
What?

654
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,589
Nothing.

655
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,915
- Do you want a drink?
- Sure.

656
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,873
What do you make of the place?

657
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,150
Is this a well-run house,
would you say?

658
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,269
- Sir William be good to work for?
- No.

659
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,434
- How long have you been doing this?
- What?

660
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,675
Valeting.

661
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,715
About seven years.
I was a footman before that.

662
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,277
And working for Lord Stockbridge,

663
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,072
- is that a promotion?
- No.

664
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,116
I used to be with
the Earl of Flintshire.

665
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,795
Then why did you move?

666
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,274
Because I felt like it.

667
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,355
Who's that?

668
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,033
That's my mother.

669
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,152
- Where's she live?
- She doesn't. I went to an orphanage.

670
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,556
That's right. Sorry.

671
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,629
What happened to her?

672
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,875
- What do you mean?
- Why did she die? Was she young?

673
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,993
Was it in childbirth?

674
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,272
You're not very curious, are you?

675
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,913
Yeah, she was young,
she worked in a factory,

676
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,112
she had me, and a little later,
she died. End of story.

677
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,910
Why didn't you say
she was a factory worker?

678
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,157
I didn't fancy discussing
my private life with strangers.

679
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,192
Sorry I spoke out of turn, mate.
Didn't mean to offend you.

680
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,915
I'm not offended.
And don't call me "mate".

681
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,755
Well, I'll see you later.

682
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,270
I've got a date with
a hot glass of milk.

683
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,398
I shouldn't worry about it.
It goes with the territory.

684
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,359
Look.

685
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,069
It's Mr. Novello.

686
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,875
And him sleeping downstairs.

687
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,149
I'm going to have to
watch you, girl.

688
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,192
Her Ladyship says Mr. Weissman's
a Hollywood producer.

689
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,638
- He does the Charlie Chan films.
- I like a fright in the cinema.

690
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,434
You could go with his valet.
He'd give you a fright.

691
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,116
Keep your eye on him.
I think he's a queer one.

692
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,756
He's not from Scotland
for a start.

693
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,236
At least not any part of it
that I know.

694
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,834
- What's Mrs. Nesbitt like?
- She's all right.

695
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,431
Feel a bit sorry for her.

696
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,600
- Of course, it never works.
- What never works?

697
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,554
When a man marries beneath him.
Hasn't the brains to carry it off.

698
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,680
It's romantic to marry for love.

699
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,072
Love? Not him.
He's a nasty piece of work.

700
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,797
"The Honourable Freddie Nesbitt".

701
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,629
That's a laugh.

702
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,396
He was after her father's money.
It was less than he thought.

703
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,350
Now it's spent, all he has
is a wife he's ashamed of.

704
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,833
And he's lost his job.

705
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,154
Wants Miss Isobel to put in
a word with Sir William.

706
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,788
- What's the matter?
- I never washed that shirt.

707
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,593
She's gonna kill me.

708
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,998
Do you think I could
do it now?

709
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,673
Do you want me to go with you?

710
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,270
No, I'll be all right.

711
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,193
What are you doing down here?

712
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,359
I have to wash Lady Trentham's
shirt for tomorrow.

713
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,112
There's a sink
in the ironing room.

714
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,719
Is someone in there?

715
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,753
What are you doing here?

716
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,797
I had to rinse this shirt out.

717
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,359
You should've knocked,
shouldn't you?

718
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,358
- Miss Trentham?
- I was washing a shirt

719
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,030
- for Her Ladyship.
- I hope you found all you required.

720
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,071
Does she have to have marmalade?

721
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,509
Dorothy made too little
and we've run out of home-made.

722
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,553
I don't suppose she'd care for
strawberry jam instead?

723
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,999
No, I thought not.

724
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,390
I wanted a word with Mrs. Wilson.

725
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,912
Tell Jennings we'll have the soup
after the fourth drive tomorrow.

726
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,670
And tell Mrs. Croft
to make sure it's hot.

727
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,553
It's been cold the last few weeks.
And more pepper to it.

728
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,069
Is that you?

729
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,591
Were you expecting someone else?

730
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,393
Don't coach your guns, even if
they can't hit a barn door.

731
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,953
- Or tell 'em unless they ask.
- Lovely day.

732
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,429
- Jennings.
- I hope it hold. Enjoy the shoot.

733
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,119
Can a pheasant ever be dangerous?

734
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,789
- Dangerous?
- Do I worry about it attacking?

735
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,639
- Morning, sir.
- Right, draw your pegs.

736
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,189
- Morning, Jennings.
- Are you shooting today, sir?

737
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,789
I never shoot.

738
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,190
I'm starving.
Where have you been?

739
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,395
Sorry.

740
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,029
They always send up
a good breakfast here.

741
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,512
I'll say that for Sylvia.

742
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,395
She not at all mean
in that way.

743
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,635
Oh, dear.

744
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,519
Bought marmalade.

745
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,116
I call that very feeble.

746
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,473
One can't have everything.
Mary...

747
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,838
I won't wear that shirt after all.
The other one's warmer.

748
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,994
Yummy.

749
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,879
Yummy, yummy.

750
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,675
What, you're going shooting?

751
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,350
Mr. Weissman wants me to
accompany him. Nothing wrong.

752
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,234
What for? You're not loading.
He hasn't got a gun.

753
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,031
- He might need something.
- What could he need?

754
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,318
We know the idea of service

755
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,556
is offensive to you, George,

756
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,789
but don't take it out on us.

757
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,673
Please forgive our ill manners,
Mr. Weissman.

758
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,995
He's got something to hide.

759
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,832
We all have something to hide,
Mr. Meredith.

760
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,311
Like to get changed now, miss?

761
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,273
- He won't do it.
- Who won't do what?

762
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,598
My father. He won't
give Freddie a job.

763
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,035
I spoke to him last night
and he said he'd think about it.

764
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,549
Now he says it isn't up to him.

765
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,830
- Why not?
- I don't know.

766
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,516
Something about why
Freddie was sacked,

767
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,995
but I can't get a straight answer
from either of them.

768
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,394
You've done your best.

769
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,319
Mr. Nesbitt can't ask for
more than that, can he?

770
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,192
But he can. Much more!

771
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,317
He says he's going to tell him.

772
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,154
Do you think he will?

773
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,154
I don't know. He says Daddy
will give him a job

774
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,679
to keep him quiet.

775
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,593
- Will you say something?
- To Mr. Nesbitt?

776
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,070
To Daddy.

777
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,195
Why do you think
I can make a difference?

778
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,189
Will you?

779
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,751
You should wear your
warm underwear today.

780
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,949
Nearly.

781
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,155
That's mine.

782
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,629
Oh God, it's on its way.

783
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,710
Damn!

784
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,319
Bloody gun's no good.

785
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,718
I told you not to bring this.

786
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,749
Blast!

787
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,270
I think I pricked that one.
I'm pretty sure...

788
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,395
Bugger.

789
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,635
Blast it!

790
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,275
Damn!

791
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,357
- Are you all right, sir?
- No, I'm not all right.

792
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,748
- Where the hell did that come from?
- It's nicked you.

793
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,552
God, it's nicked me.
Where did that...?

794
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,273
Whose the cretin that did that?

795
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,149
Find Strutt. Ask if he knows
who's responsible

796
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,511
and to send the gun
back to the bloody house.

797
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,675
Right you are, sir.

798
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:28,078
- Everyone knows we're desperate.
- There you are.

799
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,429
Did you find one?

800
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,596
- Well?
- Don't look at me.

801
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,110
If I so much as open my mouth,
it'll make things worse.

802
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,039
I've already tried.

803
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,999
Jennings says the cars are ready.

804
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,435
Goody. I'm starving.

805
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,312
I can't just let him down.

806
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,675
What are you wearing?

807
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,869
Why? Don't you like it?

808
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,955
You bought it.

809
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,628
Did I? How extraordinary of me.

810
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,033
Come on, better get going.

811
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,155
- Where's that wretched Mabel?
- Has anyone checked her outfit?

812
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,759
She's probably in black velvet

813
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,350
- with a feather in her hair.
- She looks perfectly normal.

814
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:07,031
- Don't be a snob, Aunt Constance.
- Me? I haven't a snobbish bone.

815
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,798
Mr. Meredith,
is Mr. Stockbridge in?

816
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,149
Search me.

817
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,475
Sorry to disturb you. I was making

818
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,159
my routine inspection.

819
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,199
How are you settling in
with Lord Stockbridge?

820
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,270
Sorry?

821
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,159
How are you settling in
with Lord Stockbridge?

822
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,635
I know you haven't been
with him for long.

823
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,949
Not long, no.

824
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,591
Smoking isn't allowed up here.

825
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,631
I hope you have everything
to make His Lordship comfortable.

826
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,671
I hope we haven't
forgotten anything.

827
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,075
I can't believe you forget much,
Mrs. Wilson.

828
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,638
No, not much.

829
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,353
Well, I'll leave you to your book.

830
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,268
You should be more selective

831
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,595
about the people you invite.

832
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,074
I've got a good appetite.

833
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,356
Terribly muddy here. Do watch.

834
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,671
Do go in and have a drink.

835
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,112
It's a bloody awful thing
to have happened.

836
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,434
- Louisa.
- Oh, I say.

837
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,228
Two inches to my right,
I would've been dead.

838
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,350
- What's happened to your ear?
- Some idiot shot me.

839
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,878
- I was a terrible shot.
- Did you have fun?

840
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,872
You don't realise
how serious this is.

841
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,115
Of course I do.

842
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,150
- Can't you get your sisters to help?
- You think I haven't tried?

843
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,837
- You know what they're like.
- They don't care if we go under,

844
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,919
as long as their dressmakers are busy

845
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,712
and dinner's served on time.

846
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,597
Wait, there's a queue here.

847
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,632
Shut the door, for heaven's sake!

848
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,351
Don't worry, it's only
Lewis and Dorothy.

849
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,640
If any men are found up here,
they get sacked on the spot.

850
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,589
Worse luck.

851
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,351
So you're a convent girl?

852
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,230
Or is that Presbyterian modesty?

853
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,075
- Is the water hot?
- Not really.

854
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,314
No. Won't be till
the guns get back.

855
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,393
I better get in yours.

856
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,229
Her Ladyship says Sir William
loves his shooting.

857
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,070
Yeah. Can't hit a barn door
but he does love it. It's sweet.

858
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,589
Elsie.

859
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,399
Last night...

860
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,709
What?

861
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,318
No, I shouldn't say.

862
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,118
Yes, you should. What?

863
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,835
Well...

864
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,711
when I went down
to wash that shirt,

865
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,156
I think I saw him
in the ironing room.

866
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,837
- With one of the kitchen maids.
- That wouldn't have been him.

867
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,748
I think it was.

868
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,833
He came down the passage
a minute later and I don't see...

869
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,314
No, it wasn't him.

870
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,750
- You weren't serious last night?
- I'm afraid I was, old boy.

871
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,996
I was going to tell you
next week.

872
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,319
I don't think you grasp
what it'll do to the project.

873
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,239
- It can't be as black as all that.
- Yes it bloody well is.

874
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,469
I'm sorry to hear that,
but business is business.

875
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,269
- I'm not a charity commissioner.
- I'm begging you.

876
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,355
Dammit.

877
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,749
Oh, dear.

878
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,038
- I'll clear that up.
- I'm sorry.

879
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,390
Meanwhile I'll get the glass
under the table.

880
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,479
Have you got a cloth?

881
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,231
A cloth... We'll clean that
at the house for you, sir.

882
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,952
I borrowed it from Lewis.

883
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,951
I've also been frightened to death.

884
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,469
Perfectly all right, sir.
You just leave this.

885
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,798
You know how you said
Sir William could have his pick

886
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,589
between Lady Sylvia
and Lady Stockbridge?

887
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,189
I asked Her Ladyship about it

888
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,915
and she said they
cut cards for him.

889
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,875
- No!
- I can't believe it either.

890
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,075
Do you suppose

891
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,429
it was a joke?

892
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,318
I wouldn't be too sure.

893
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,108
You know what I heard?

894
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,310
- Just listen to me.
- What?

895
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,954
Why do we spend our lives
living through them?

896
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,317
Look at poor old Lewis.

897
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,191
Her mother's heart attack'd mean
less to her than Lady Sylvia's farts.

898
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,359
You must know.
You can't fool me.

899
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,155
I don't look for discretion
in a maid.

900
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,831
- Except with my own secrets.
- I don't know much, my Lady.

901
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,828
But apparently he counted on
Sir William for an investment

902
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,519
and guaranteed his interest,

903
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,836
whatever that means.
Anyway, Barnes his valet

904
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,713
said he wanted to leave at once,

905
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,798
but Lady Lavinia persuaded him
to stay until tomorrow,

906
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,558
to make less of a thing of it.

907
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,231
Thank heavens. Lewis told me

908
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,910
- you were wearing white.
- She's mad. I never wear white.

909
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,678
I thought it was a little odd.

910
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,508
By the way,
don't rub him up tonight.

911
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,908
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know exactly what I mean.

912
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,549
He's in a filthy mood
with everyone.

913
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,070
He's talking about
stopping your allowance.

914
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,238
But it's for life!
That was settled. He can't.

915
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,910
Just you watch him.
He's spoiling for a fight,

916
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,951
so don't give him one.

917
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,157
Now that,
you can be discreet about.

918
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,755
Thank you.

919
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,751
Isn't it pretty here?

920
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,557
The house has such a
lovely position.

921
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,518
The best view is from
the old water tower.

922
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,869
You might walk up there tomorrow.

923
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,237
Do you really have to
go back to London?

924
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,872
I'm afraid so, Raymond.

925
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,790
When you're ruined,
there's so much to do.

926
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,150
Yes, there is, isn't there?
Moan, moan, moan.

927
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,157
Anyone care for a game
of bridge

928
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,715
- after dinner?
- Yes, I wouldn't mind.

929
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,715
Who else? Louisa, how about you?

930
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,033
I don't think so. I've rather

931
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,355
gone off cards.

932
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,317
I've never been lucky with them.

933
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,155
Me too.

934
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,269
Mr. Weissman.

935
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,635
Yes?

936
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,512
- Tell us about your film.
- Sure.

937
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,597
It's called
"Charlie Chan in London".

938
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,429
- It's a detective story.
- Set in London?

939
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,596
Not really.
Most of it takes place

940
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,793
at a shooting party in
a country house. Like this one.

941
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,118
A murder at night.
A lot of guests for the weekend.

942
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,515
Everyone's a suspect.
That sort of thing.

943
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,949
How horrid.

944
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,157
Who turns out to have done it?

945
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,874
I couldn't tell you.
That would spoil it for you.

946
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,155
But none of us will see it.

947
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,712
Are you making it here?

948
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,593
No, we'll shoot it in Hollywood.

949
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,028
On the back lot.

950
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,152
But since I was in England
I thought I'd do a little research

951
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,079
on country living and Ivor

952
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,748
was kind enough to
arrange it for me.

953
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,677
No, William arranged it for you.

954
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,553
Are you interested in films, sir?

955
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,079
Not likely.

956
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,956
Why shouldn't I be interested?

957
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,999
You don't know what
I'm interested in.

958
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,272
You're interested in money
and fiddling with your guns,

959
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:01,109
- but anything else and I'm stumped.
- That is not fair. Billy...

960
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,549
Elsie.

961
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,119
Elsie, what's...?

962
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,518
It's not as if I didn't know.

963
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,714
So we can all play bridge.

964
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,672
- All playing?
- Who's going to play bridge?

965
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,114
Where's Rupert?

966
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,718
- Rupert?
- Coming.

967
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,229
I heard Lady Sylvia
spoke out of turn.

968
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,914
- What'll happen to Elsie?
- Lucky if they don't boot her out

969
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,792
- before morning.
- You should've seen it.

970
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,518
She has been here a long time.

971
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,280
Shall I tell you what that
means to them? Bugger all.

972
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,438
Please. There are ladies present.

973
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,709
Where exactly is

974
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,230
- Sir William now?
- The library. He won't come out.

975
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,074
Dorothy.

976
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,159
Mr. Meredith,

977
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,113
may I ask what is going on?

978
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,392
George, join me in the drawing room
as soon as possible.

979
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,595
- Mr. Probert, take them downstairs.
- Certainly.

980
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,918
Dorothy, I'm surprised at you.

981
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,995
Come along, ladies.

982
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,199
Is it true then?
Has Elsie really been sacked?

983
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,233
- Lady Trentham.
- Well,

984
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,475
luck of the draw.

985
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,678
- I think I'd like to...
- Darling, we've just cut.

986
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,598
- Allow me.
- Thank you so much.

987
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:20,237
Am I awful if I ask you to play
something to cheer us up?

988
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,436
- No, of course not.
- Thank you.

989
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,992
I've booked the first passage home

990
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,997
and I'll be living on the phone
till I set sail

991
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,838
and I have to be
in London tomorrow,

992
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,991
so if you'd prefer to stay,
I can take a train.

993
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,350
- I'll give you a lift.
- Thank you.

994
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,991
You're providing a lot of
entertainment for nothing.

995
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,592
I'm used to it.

996
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,869
Excuse me.

997
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,349
Somewhere there's another land...

998
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,598
Darling, you're not going to
watch over my shoulder?

999
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,234
You'll put me off.

1000
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,915
...that little place we know.

1001
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,034
Innocence...

1002
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,071
Do you think he'll be
as long as he usually is?

1003
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,876
- Anyway...
- I think he's rather wonderful.

1004
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,958
Wonderful.

1005
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,832
I have only seen one.

1006
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,718
We shall never find

1007
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,876
that lovely land

1008
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,151
of Might-Have-Been.

1009
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,077
I shall never be your king,

1010
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,068
nor you shall be my queen.

1011
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,036
Days may pass
and years may pass

1012
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,391
and seas may lie between...

1013
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,913
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- Come on.

1014
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,598
Sometimes, on the rarest nights,

1015
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,394
comes the vision...

1016
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,636
I don't know. It's just...

1017
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,432
- How could she let him touch her?
- Sounds like you don't like him.

1018
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,159
You'd be surprised.

1019
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,828
- All right, surprise me.
- Maybe I will.

1020
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,632
I saw him in "The Lodger",

1021
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,230
but I've never heard him
sing in person.

1022
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,838
Hope that plays her tune alone,

1023
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:26,230
love that conquers pain
and death.

1024
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,717
Will you excuse me a minute?

1025
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,514
- You don't need my help?
- No.

1026
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,957
Shall I ever be your king?

1027
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,355
Oh, my Lord!

1028
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,834
Days may pass or years
may pass and seas

1029
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,031
may lie between.

1030
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,955
Shall we ever find

1031
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,711
our lovely land?

1032
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:02,671
It seems much more than
background music somehow.

1033
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,757
Ivor, darling, it was lovely.

1034
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,589
Thank you.

1035
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,073
I seem to be the victim

1036
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,993
of a cruel jest.

1037
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,512
It dogs my footsteps

1038
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,711
with the girl I love the best.

1039
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:21,955
Anthony.

1040
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,594
It's the commander!

1041
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,115
- Oh, excuse me.
- Good evening, sir.

1042
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,439
- No, carry on.
- Yes, sir.

1043
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,471
My car will meet her

1044
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,678
and her mother comes too.

1045
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,070
What do you want?

1046
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,758
- Brought you some coffee.
- Lf I wanted it, I'd have rung.

1047
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,470
Leave that. Give me some whisky.

1048
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,951
And her brother comes too.

1049
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,637
I thought you might
need a drink.

1050
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,073
And some company.

1051
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,398
That's very kind of you.

1052
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,434
Give me just a sec.

1053
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,792
Lovely, long repertoire.

1054
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,000
- Where's Anthony?
- Washing his hands, I suppose.

1055
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,718
Managed to escape this, didn't he?

1056
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,070
He hasn't gone to bother
William again, has he?

1057
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,513
I can give you the starlight,

1058
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,916
love unchanging and true...

1059
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,273
We've run out of milk.
Won't be a moment.

1060
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,278
Desperate for a fag.

1061
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,434
...pools of shimmering blue.

1062
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,118
All that I can be,

1063
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:47,113
all you ask of me,
music in spring,

1064
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,670
flowers for a king,

1065
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,714
all these I bring for you.

1066
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,678
When I was young,

1067
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,033
my foolish fancies...

1068
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,758
Where's Mr. Weissman's man?

1069
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,713
He's missing the music.

1070
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,509
What are you doing?
Dorothy, get back to work.

1071
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,755
Excuse me...

1072
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,549
but Dorothy's under
my jurisdiction as well,

1073
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,759
and I say she can listen to
a spot of music if she likes.

1074
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,917
- Excuse me, where's the telephone?
- Sorry, sir.

1075
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,912
It's just over there.

1076
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,598
...pools of shimmering blue.

1077
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,478
Call and I can be

1078
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,596
all you ask of me.

1079
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,075
Music in spring,

1080
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,068
flowers for a king,

1081
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,997
all these I bring to you.

1082
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,554
Don't encourage him.
He'll just go on and on.

1083
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,678
In BC 33, ah me,

1084
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,717
that's a dash long time ago,

1085
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,275
there lived a Roman hero

1086
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,711
who had shaken hands with Nero.

1087
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,839
You're still here.

1088
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:38,074
- I thought that...
- Appearances can be deceptive.

1089
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,669
Elsie.

1090
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,839
Good night.

1091
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,920
So if you wonder
what a duke should be,

1092
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,077
just you take another look at me.

1093
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,072
When old King Canute
was buying fruit

1094
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,032
one day, so runs the tale,

1095
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,676
a young convicted felon

1096
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,679
brought him a juicy melon

1097
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,072
and was then released from jail.

1098
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,198
This noble youth,
to tell the truth,

1099
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,112
sailed right away to sea

1100
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,835
and the Duke of Malta's daughter

1101
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,230
brought up his shaving water

1102
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:47,188
and the grand result was me.

1103
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,436
So if you wonder what

1104
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,518
a duke should be, just take
another look at me.

1105
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,869
I'm doubty,

1106
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,072
I'm gouty,
I'm wonderful to see.

1107
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,750
All my people,
upon my soul it's true

1108
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,158
look on Noah as a parvenu.
You can search your family tree

1109
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:10,069
but you'll never find
a duke like me.

1110
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,790
If you wonder what a duke
could be, take another look at me.

1111
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,558
I'm doubty, I'm gouty,

1112
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,876
I'm wonderful to see.

1113
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,752
All my people,
upon my soul it's true,

1114
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,033
look on Noah as a parvenu.
You can search your family tree,

1115
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,037
but you'll never find...

1116
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,117
So he gave you that
for your birthday, did he?

1117
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,310
He gave you that for your
birthday, William did?

1118
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,836
I've got a call booked
for California.

1119
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:41,914
California.

1120
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,514
We're both undoubtedly sane.

1121
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,434
We're not so horribly plain.

1122
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,718
Something is wrong, but who
can tell us what.

1123
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,953
- Freddie, we gave up on you.
- No, please, sit down.

1124
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,679
We waited as long as we could.

1125
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,072
- Is William still in the library?
- Where have you been?

1126
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,630
- I suppose...
- Where could he be?

1127
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,759
None of your bloody business.

1128
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,440
- I could try and fetch him.
- Would you?

1129
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,232
He's always preferred you to me.

1130
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,509
Yes, I'd be delighted.

1131
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,315
Goodness.

1132
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,918
Today is not my day.

1133
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,509
If that's what you call a moment,
I'd like to see

1134
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,914
when you take a real break.

1135
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,476
Here, did yours as well.

1136
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,550
- Before the rush starts.
- Thank you.

1137
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,391
Why isn't it you?

1138
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:58,389
Why must we miss
a chance like this?

1139
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,155
- Where have you been?
- It's fine, it's fine.

1140
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,390
William?

1141
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,079
God, Bill.

1142
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,350
Come here, you horrid dirty thing.

1143
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,510
Bill.

1144
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:23,077
You've got lips for me,
the hips for me,

1145
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,669
the feet for me,
and the beat for me.

1146
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,915
Dear God!

1147
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,675
Louisa!

1148
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,069
Isobel!

1149
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,594
Isobel!

1150
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,191
George?

1151
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:42,870
Excuse me, sir.

1152
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,389
Jennings.

1153
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,908
Excuse me, madam.

1154
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:59,709
Oh, dear.

1155
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,396
- Stand back, Johnny.
- Give her some air.

1156
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,031
Could somebody get
a glass of water?

1157
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,152
- Keep everybody out of this room.
- Yes, certainly, sir.

1158
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,675
Now Louisa, do sit
and be quiet.

1159
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:17,875
Bennett.

1160
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,595
Mummy.

1161
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,115
- Just stay there.
- Is she all right?

1162
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,629
- Everything's fine.
- Sylvia...

1163
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,589
Mummy.

1164
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,598
You can tell Mr. Warner...

1165
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,633
- Excuse me, I need that phone.
- Excuse me, I'm on the telephone.

1166
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,751
I'm on a call to California.

1167
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,838
Could you connect me with
the police station, please?

1168
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:58,073
I'm looking for a realistic
Charlie Chan movie.

1169
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,953
This isn't out of the question.
We should try.

1170
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,993
We can't do the same shit
over and over again.

1171
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:10,195
Alan Mowbray. I like that.
These people look like him.

1172
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,758
They're tall, don't say much,

1173
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,554
and have fucking British accents.

1174
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,478
They talk like they're
from England.

1175
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,635
- Evening. We've been expecting you.
- This is Constable Dexter, I'm...

1176
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,751
- You must be the police.
- Yes, I'm Inspector Thom...

1177
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,872
I'm Lady Sylvia McCordle.
We haven't moved him.

1178
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,879
Everyone's in the red room.
Like to come straight through?

1179
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,913
- Certainly.
- He's just an American staying here.

1180
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:38,990
I'll tell you who we are
and we can leave you with William.

1181
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,760
Yes, indeed. I'm Inspector...

1182
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,110
- Lady Trentham.
- Yes, the Countess of Trentham.

1183
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,709
I served with your husband
on a committee...

1184
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,275
My brother-in-law Lord Stockbridge,
Lady Stockbridge.

1185
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,833
Jennings, please would you remove

1186
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:51,995
that vile animal.

1187
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,474
Mrs. Nesbitt, Mr. Nesbitt.

1188
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,279
Ivor Novello, but I'm sure needs

1189
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,436
no introduction. No, wait.

1190
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,990
Would you like to speak to
the servants tonight?

1191
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,198
He ought to speak to Probert.
Tell him to come up.

1192
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,753
- Certainly.
- Where was I?

1193
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,589
- Isobel McCordle, my daughter.
- Chan's in London, not California.

1194
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:14,438
We have rewrites of
the cockney maid part

1195
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,472
and she runs in
and says all these things.

1196
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,955
I'm here. They don't talk.

1197
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:23,153
The butlers and maids,
they stand. They serve.

1198
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,829
What about Claudette Colbert?
She sounds British.

1199
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,236
Is she affected or British?

1200
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,868
Dorothy, would you take...?

1201
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,832
Come on, spit it out.

1202
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,829
- The police would like to see you.
- Me?

1203
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,837
No, Mrs. Croft, Mr. Probert.

1204
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,829
Me?

1205
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:54,669
Why?

1206
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,472
I don't know what I can tell them.

1207
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,390
George, see if anything more
is required in the red room.

1208
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,076
I don't see the point in
the rest of you waiting up.

1209
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,554
What about me, Mr. Jennings?

1210
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,670
You can go as soon as the police
release you. Some time tomorrow.

1211
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,278
Until then, you can
stay in your room.

1212
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,198
I'm not contagious, you know.

1213
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,719
Nobody's going anywhere.

1214
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,958
Those with remaining duties,
see to them quickly.

1215
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,515
Otherwise,

1216
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,352
good night, everyone.

1217
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,313
Fat old oik.

1218
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,438
- Mr. Jennings.
- Yes, Mr. Weissman.

1219
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,198
I have a confession to make.

1220
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,913
I think it's clear
the valet did it.

1221
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,030
No, because the valet has
access to everybody.

1222
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,191
No, the valet isn't the butler.

1223
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,116
There's one butler
and lots of valets.

1224
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,471
He takes care of people.
He's in their rooms at night.

1225
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,877
The valet could easily
have done it.

1226
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,831
Pull yourself together, Mr. Probert.

1227
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,957
Be patient.
They'll be along in a minute.

1228
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,594
Couldn't I just make him

1229
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,389
a bit more comfortable, sir?

1230
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,194
- Have a heart, Inspector.
- It wouldn't be wise, sir.

1231
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,199
We shouldn't have to wait
much longer now.

1232
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,197
I don't think it would
do any harm. Go on.

1233
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,833
See that's why we have
rules and regulations.

1234
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,274
What is it, Dexter?

1235
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,188
There doesn't seem to be

1236
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,515
much blood, sir.

1237
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,191
- Is that everything, my Lord?
- Yes. Thank you, Parks.

1238
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,551
- You should try to sleep.
- It's so unfair.

1239
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,468
Nobody liked him.

1240
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,229
Stop snivelling. Anyone would
think you were Italian.

1241
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:09,829
Christ.

1242
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,559
Will you let me help you?

1243
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,113
No, I can manage.

1244
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,839
- Then I'll say good night.
- No, wait.

1245
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,394
Thank you, my Lady.

1246
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,474
What is it?

1247
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,995
Please tell me you haven't
come with condolences.

1248
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,995
No, I was just wondering

1249
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,519
- if you wanted some com...
- What?

1250
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:12,069
I said I was just wondering
if you wanted some company.

1251
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,752
I suppose life must go on.

1252
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,359
Unhook me.

1253
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,230
No, there's another one.
You'll never get it off like that.

1254
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,149
I'm sorry, for everything.

1255
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,799
Don't feel sorry for me.
Pity that poor Dorothy.

1256
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:49,757
She's got the early morning teas
and the breakfast trays...

1257
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:54,759
then get Miss Isobel down,
if there's anything in black.

1258
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,600
She needs your sympathy.
I'm well out of it.

1259
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,479
I would think Miss Isobel
would stay in bed tomorrow.

1260
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,315
Unmarried girls

1261
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,034
don't have breakfast trays.
Not in this house.

1262
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,352
I wish I could help.

1263
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,508
Well, you can't.

1264
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:38,718
George says Mr. Novello
was in on it. And Sir William.

1265
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,953
The point is, that Henry Denton,
he's an actor.

1266
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,309
An actor?

1267
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,830
He's playing a butler
in the next Charlie Chan.

1268
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,792
I'd say the joke was on Lady Sylvia.

1269
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,195
I hope Mr. Jennings
wasn't his model,

1270
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,470
or he'd be too squiffy
to remember his lines.

1271
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:58,630
Mrs. Croft, isn't it?
I wonder if I could

1272
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,671
have a few words with you.
I'm Inspector Thom...

1273
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,075
I haven't got time for this.
I'm doing the breakfasts.

1274
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:09,758
It won't take much time.
Perhaps you have a room.

1275
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:13,512
You better come to my room.
Bertha, I'm leaving you in charge.

1276
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:16,837
Dorothy, make sure the menus
are on Her Ladyship's tray.

1277
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,871
Get that filthy dog out of here.

1278
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,353
Honestly,

1279
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:27,075
these days the countryside
is more dangerous than Piccadilly.

1280
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,709
Why a silver pantry knife?
It doesn't make sense.

1281
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,392
He must have forgotten
to bring one.

1282
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,991
Think of what they
have to carry about.

1283
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:41,079
All those jemmies and torches
and skeleton keys.

1284
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,955
It's a miracle anyone
ever gets burgled.

1285
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:47,831
It's glacial in here.
Get my fur, will you?

1286
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,195
Anyway, it wasn't in
the silver pantry.

1287
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,595
It went missing yesterday.

1288
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,553
Obviously William had it.

1289
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,910
When the fellow surprised him,

1290
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,997
there it was, handy as you like.

1291
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:06,277
Are any of the others
getting up for breakfast?

1292
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,631
Lady Lavinia may be.

1293
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,750
That settles it. Come back
at 8:30. I'll get dressed.

1294
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:15,792
It's the greatest bore,
of course.

1295
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,752
But I don't want to
miss anything.

1296
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,869
When I came back last night,

1297
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,153
- I found this on my table.
- What is it?

1298
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,272
"This is your final warning.

1299
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,398
If I've not received an offer..."

1300
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,997
Freddie". What a stupid idiot!

1301
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,273
At least he's off your back.

1302
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,914
No one will give him
a job to shut up.

1303
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,552
He's quite a bonny lad.

1304
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,076
What's he up to these days?

1305
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,269
He's dead.

1306
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,678
I don't know what I can tell you.

1307
01:27:58,920 --> 01:27:59,989
Shouldn't you be looking for

1308
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,315
signs of a break in?

1309
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,273
I understand that no one has
served Sir William

1310
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,550
longer than you have.

1311
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:10,117
I better be off.
Might not see you again.

1312
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,039
I'm only staying

1313
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,275
till the police give the nod.

1314
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:16,549
But Elsie,

1315
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,518
you're not in any difficulty?

1316
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,916
Apart from having
no home and no job?

1317
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,631
No, there's no worries there.

1318
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:31,235
Yes, I was forgetting.
You were much cleverer than I was.

1319
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,039
You'll be fine.

1320
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,397
What will Lady Sylvia do?

1321
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,990
I'd set up in London
as a glamorous widow

1322
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,749
with all the gentlemen
chasing me for my money.

1323
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,313
I wouldn't. I grew up in London.

1324
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:51,272
- Is that where the orphanage was?
- On the edge. Isleworth.

1325
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,195
And don't you get homesick?

1326
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:56,517
Not if you never had a home.
Heard about Weissman's valet?

1327
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,119
- What about him?
- Turns out he's a fraud.

1328
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,354
- He isn't Scottish at all.
- I could've told you that.

1329
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,238
- Who is he then?
- Is he the murderer?

1330
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,556
Worse than that. He's an actor.

1331
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,517
Yes, I want you to wake him up.
How else do I talk to him?

1332
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,110
Yes, right. What did he say?

1333
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,188
He's talking about
Clara Bow again? Listen.

1334
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,990
Tell Sheehan I think
Clara Bow is a nice person,

1335
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,432
and I don't want her
in the fucking movie.

1336
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,630
This bastard's death
may have saved my bacon.

1337
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,149
For God's sake, be quiet.
What the matter with you?

1338
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:40,715
Arthur.

1339
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,556
- Are these tomatoes?
- Yes, my Lady.

1340
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,352
That's exactly what I want.

1341
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,071
- Good morning.
- Morning, dear.

1342
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,596
Have you heard? That frightful
inspector won't let anyone leave.

1343
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:59,274
Another day of Weissman
shouting down the telephone.

1344
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,193
He has some work problems

1345
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,674
in Los Angeles.

1346
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,998
I must say he conducts
his affairs very oddly.

1347
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,909
Coming downstairs, I thought
I was in a Marseilles bar.

1348
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:14,631
Excuse me. I'm expecting
a really important phone call.

1349
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,149
- Would you get me when it comes?
- Very good, sir.

1350
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,989
Thank you. And I'd like
tomato and eggs.

1351
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,233
Of course, sir, but...

1352
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,719
perhaps you would prefer to
choose for yourself, sir?

1353
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:29,275
What do you mean,
like cafeteria style?

1354
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,509
The Englishman is never
waited on at breakfast.

1355
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:36,632
Really? That's interesting,
because an American is.

1356
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,828
I'm gonna make a note of that.

1357
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,715
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1358
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,677
I'd like some coffee, Jennings.

1359
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:54,834
There it is.

1360
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,551
You haven't made
a lot of friends here.

1361
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:01,400
Good. Good morning,
ladies, gents.

1362
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,399
I wonder, excuse me...

1363
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,232
- Will Lady Sylvia be down soon?
- I shouldn't think so.

1364
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,637
She has breakfast in her room,
then usually goes for a ride.

1365
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,234
But she won't be doing that
this morning, will she?

1366
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,069
Oh, I see.

1367
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:26,116
In that case, Lady Trentham,
I wonder if you'd be kind enough

1368
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,914
to join us for some questions?

1369
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,717
If you wish, Inspector.
I won't be much help.

1370
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:36,993
But on a day like this
we all have to pull our weight.

1371
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,509
Mr. Denton made a chump
out of Mr. Jennings.

1372
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,836
Never mind that.
Did you hear about Sir William?

1373
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:46,516
Apparently he wasn't stabbed.
I mean, he was,

1374
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,359
but that's not why he died.

1375
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,998
He was poisoned.
That's what killed him.

1376
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,198
Inspector told Mrs. Croft.

1377
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,155
They don't know why the killer
stabbed him but he was dead.

1378
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,952
That's why there was no blood.

1379
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,717
Dead bodies don't bleed.

1380
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,515
Trust Sir William
to be murdered twice.

1381
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:11,316
He wasn't murdered,
not that sort of murder.

1382
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,950
Some ruffian broke in
thinking the library was empty.

1383
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,917
Sir William surprised him
and paid the price for it.

1384
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,831
- And very tragic it is too.
- I can't see that.

1385
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,155
I mean...

1386
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:27,511
ruffians don't poison people
and then stab the corpses.

1387
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,234
Apart from anything else,

1388
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,192
they're usually in a hurry
to get away, aren't they?

1389
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,389
What are you suggesting?

1390
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,749
Nothing, just...

1391
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,075
Just what?

1392
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,509
It looks like Sir William
was killed deliberately.

1393
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,998
No wonder they won't let us go.

1394
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,230
Tough luck on anyone
who's got secrets to hide.

1395
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,876
Now they've cancelled
the shooting,

1396
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,435
muggins here has to pull
a luncheon out of the hat.

1397
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:56,398
- Is Her Ladyship back yet?
- No.

1398
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,472
Then she'll take what she gets.

1399
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,112
Why would anyone kill Sir William?

1400
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,709
He wasn't exactly
Father Christmas.

1401
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:05,919
Get on with your work.

1402
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:07,997
And take that filthy dog out.

1403
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,916
He made a few enemies in his time.

1404
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:15,715
- "Enemies"? When?
- Is this before the war?

1405
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,751
When you were a factory worker?

1406
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:20,838
I was never a factory worker.

1407
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,310
I was a cook in
one of his factories.

1408
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:25,636
He had two in Isleworth
and two in Twickenham,

1409
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,149
all full of girls,
so you can imagine.

1410
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,999
Weren't factory girls risky?
Suppose they had complained?

1411
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,633
Who to exactly?

1412
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,511
What if they got in trouble?

1413
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,552
- What sort of trouble?
- Take these. Whites only.

1414
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,590
Didn't happen very often.
When it did,

1415
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,992
he'd arrange to have it adopted.

1416
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,472
What if you didn't want it adopted?

1417
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,840
- Say you wanted to keep it?
- Then you lost your job.

1418
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,749
Take my word, he was
a hard-hearted, randy old sod.

1419
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:01,316
- Come in, I'm Inspector...
- This is all

1420
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,592
too tiresome and absurd.
He's making the most dreadful fuss.

1421
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,314
I'd like to ask the young lady
some questions.

1422
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,878
I'm not leaving,
if that's what you think.

1423
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,353
Does it bother you
if Lady Trentham stays?

1424
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,993
- Why should it?
- Sir, someone's

1425
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,872
traipsed a load of mud in here.

1426
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,308
Not now, Dexter.

1427
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:21,989
I understood there was

1428
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,236
some difficulty between

1429
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:27,432
- Sir William and your employer.
- This is too vulgar.

1430
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,037
I wasn't aware of that.
They got on well.

1431
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,595
- You were not conscious...?
- There's a broken coffee cup.

1432
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,075
They have people to
clear these things up.

1433
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,713
On with your job.

1434
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:40,709
So you were not aware of

1435
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,229
trouble over the matter of
an allowance?

1436
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,552
An allowance, I might add,

1437
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,910
that Sir William's death
has now made secure.

1438
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:52,269
What allowance would that be, sir?

1439
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:01,869
There you are.

1440
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,519
Have you got enough light?

1441
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,795
Black on black. We don't
want you going blind.

1442
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:12,392
They've got to be done.
Outside staff

1443
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,359
need them for the funeral.

1444
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,792
Sorry this business with Elsie
has landed you with so much work.

1445
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,560
That's what comes of being reliable.

1446
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,672
Never mind me.
Mr. Jennings...

1447
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,917
have you spoken to
the police again?

1448
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,674
Not yet, no.

1449
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,954
I suppose they have to
ask their questions, don't they?

1450
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:36,869
Well, yes.

1451
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,793
Will they be talking to
all of us?

1452
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,273
I shouldn't think so.

1453
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:46,589
I'll leave you to it then.

1454
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:47,630
Mr. Jennings.

1455
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:53,033
You know I'd say anything
you want me to.

1456
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,593
- What?
- Anything

1457
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:02,669
I don't care if it'll help you.
You've only to ask.

1458
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:22,392
Let me pour you a cup of tea.

1459
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:26,149
Yes, thank you. Mind putting
the milk in afterwards?

1460
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:31,392
I don't know what came over me.
I usually put it in afterwards,

1461
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,794
- but on that occasion...
- Sir.

1462
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,355
Not now, thank you.
So sorry.

1463
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:39,112
Mrs. Thompson prefers the milk
in first, so I...

1464
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:42,039
get used to pouring for her.
Some nonsense

1465
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,550
about bacteria. You know
what women are like, well, wives.

1466
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,877
She's a funny old... Sugar?

1467
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,559
No, thank you.

1468
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,670
- Mr. Parks.
- Robert.

1469
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,669
Robert, then.

1470
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:02,674
It's just...

1471
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,550
last night when you said
you'd surprise me,

1472
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,633
you didn't mean anything
by it, did you?

1473
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,877
Why? Don't you like surprises?

1474
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,713
Mr. Stockbridge.

1475
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,788
I assume you're all aware

1476
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,752
that Mr. Denton

1477
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:24,670
played a trick on us by
posing as a valet.

1478
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,790
Since Sir William was aware of it,

1479
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,037
it's not for anyone to criticise it.

1480
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,432
However, it leaves us with
some adjustments for this evening.

1481
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:40,156
Arthur, you'll dress Mr. Weissman.
That leaves Mr. Novello.

1482
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,430
I don't want to ask you,
Mr. Probert.

1483
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:45,438
- I don't mind.
- You've got enough on your plate.

1484
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:49,872
- I'll do him if you like.
- That's very generous of you.

1485
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:53,592
- I could always do it myself.
- No.

1486
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,916
- It's no trouble for a night or two.
- Good.

1487
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,917
Splendid. That's settled then.

1488
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:02,036
I think we can leave Mr. Denton
to dress himself.

1489
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,230
"The bastard's death may have
saved my bacon".

1490
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:11,077
- What did he mean by that?
- Isn't it obvious?

1491
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:12,676
Is it?

1492
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,111
Perhaps the investment
Sir William had agreed

1493
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,754
would have to be paid now. Sir.

1494
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:22,635
What about the low shot
that nearly killed him?

1495
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:24,319
- Sir.
- What is it?

1496
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,750
We haven't dusted those things
for fingerprints yet.

1497
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,389
Good.

1498
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:34,234
- Might the shot have been intended?
- It nearly took his ear off.

1499
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,196
Thank you.
You've been most helpful.

1500
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,958
Ask Commander Meredith
to join us now.

1501
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:45,279
You won't tell him
what I said, Inspector Thomas?

1502
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:50,756
Thompson! Never mind.
Just go and fetch him, please.

1503
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:54,995
Sir.

1504
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:04,350
- We've only got this.
- Mine hasn't go any black here.

1505
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:05,669
We've got some new ones.

1506
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,757
- You're a lech.
- George.

1507
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:09,989
They're coming in a minute.

1508
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,553
The dressing bell's just gone.

1509
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,593
I'm going out of my mind.
I've read my magazines twice.

1510
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,756
Get something from the library,

1511
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,554
even if it's "Horse and Hound".

1512
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,238
Well, we are honoured.

1513
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:29,159
In case you've forgotten,
this is the servants' area.

1514
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,193
Yours is at the top of the
stairs behind that door.

1515
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:35,472
Barnes, I just wanted to explain.

1516
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,352
No explanation necessary,
Mr. Denton.

1517
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,869
If you'll excuse me,
some of us have real work to do.

1518
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:43,789
- Come on, Arthur.
- The accent was a dead give away.

1519
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,278
- I was just having fun.
- Enjoy your fun in the drawing room.

1520
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:53,119
They're afraid you'll repeat things,
be indiscreet.

1521
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:57,069
But I'm very discreet.
I'm known in Hollywood for it.

1522
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:58,874
My discretion.

1523
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,357
- Tell Rupert, he won't give money.
- You misunderstand me.

1524
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,516
And mummy wouldn't pay
five pounds to save me.

1525
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:12,680
Poor darling, come here.

1526
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:17,593
Don't think I'm enjoying this.
All I wanted was a job.

1527
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:21,592
I'll give you a cheque
after dinner.

1528
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:31,389
- Have you seen my man Parks?
- No, I've been with the police.

1529
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,876
You look as if you've had
rather a pasting.

1530
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,840
They kept on about
the low shot yesterday

1531
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,994
and wouldn't let it go.

1532
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,876
Obviously I told them it was
nothing to do with me.

1533
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,753
I'm sure, but another time
try to be less greedy.

1534
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,234
- Parks.
- What?

1535
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,158
Attend to Mr. Novello first.
I want a word with Her Ladyship.

1536
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,515
Very well, my Lord.

1537
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:54,075
- What?
- I saw you.

1538
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,272
Of course it was an accident.

1539
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:00,349
It's hard for a short man like you
to gauge the height of the birds.

1540
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,635
Mr. Meredith.

1541
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:11,397
You haven't seen Commander Meredith
anywhere, have you?

1542
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,909
He's not downstairs or in his room.

1543
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:18,591
I washed and dressed him.
Not my fault he can't find his way.

1544
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:31,993
- I didn't mean to disturb you.
- No, please.

1545
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,873
I'm just trying
some of your jam.

1546
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,594
I must be in your way.

1547
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,036
No, no bother.

1548
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:42,875
What one is that, sir?

1549
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:47,476
It's raspberry, October '31.

1550
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,038
You might like to try

1551
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,596
- the strawberry one.
- Was there strawberry?

1552
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,753
Are you all right, sir?

1553
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,752
I've just been with the inspector

1554
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,679
and I feel a little bruised.

1555
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,278
Why is it, would you say,

1556
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,235
that some people seem to get
whatever they want in life?

1557
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,076
Everything they touch
turns to gold.

1558
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,359
Whereas others can strive
and strive...

1559
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,269
and have nothing?

1560
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,438
Do you believe in luck?

1561
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,439
Do you believe some men are lucky

1562
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,717
and some men just aren't,

1563
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,997
- and nothing they can do about it?
- I believe in love.

1564
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,630
Not just getting it,
giving it.

1565
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:56,236
As long as you can love somebody,
whether or not they love you,

1566
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:58,431
then it's worth it.

1567
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:08,959
That's a good answer.

1568
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,439
I'd better go.

1569
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,471
They must've finished dinner.

1570
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:18,275
Thank you.

1571
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:23,033
I thought the wine was
frightful tonight. Vile.

1572
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:24,673
Jennings, old boy.

1573
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,355
I'll have a bourbon.

1574
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:30,471
We don't have bourbon.
Ordinary Scotch or single malt.

1575
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,356
Ordinary for me.
I'm just an American.

1576
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:41,277
This is not an ideal time,
but I'd like to

1577
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:42,708
see you again.

1578
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,391
Mabel is so clever
to travel light.

1579
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:48,999
Why wear a different frock
every night?

1580
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:52,516
- We're not in a fashion parade.
- No, and I wouldn't want to be.

1581
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,229
- Excuse me.
- Difficult colour, green.

1582
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:59,193
- What did she say?
- Very tricky.

1583
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,238
- Isobel.
- Excuse me.

1584
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,829
This tune used to make me cry.

1585
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:23,994
I promise you I can
pay you back every penny.

1586
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,189
I must say...

1587
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:30,558
your guests have more
comfortable beds than servants.

1588
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:34,835
Excuse me.

1589
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,194
What did Isobel give you?

1590
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,355
What did Isobel give to you?
Tell me!

1591
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,036
Ivor...

1592
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:45,837
would you play something cheerful?

1593
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,758
We're all quite emotional
enough as it is.

1594
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:52,235
Excuse me.

1595
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:54,158
Freddie, stop all your lies!

1596
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:57,868
If you don't give it to me now,
I'll scream this house down.

1597
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,393
If you don't believe me,
try me.

1598
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,272
Where have you been?

1599
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:05,433
You've missed dinner.
We can organise a tray.

1600
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:11,275
Try buying yourself
a new frock with that.

1601
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,195
- We gave up, Louisa.
- Right.

1602
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,674
I'm so sorry.

1603
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,629
No coffee, but I'll have...

1604
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:25,069
- I apologise. I can't imagine...
- Son of a bitch, it was on purpose.

1605
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:27,072
Shall I fetch you a towel?

1606
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,592
- Arthur...
- Oh dear.

1607
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:40,915
Clean this up.

1608
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:46,990
They fished parts of her body
from the Thames.

1609
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:50,715
- Some more tea, Constable?
- I'll take that, Bertha.

1610
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,236
- Well, go on.
- No head, no hands.

1611
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:58,199
What's the point?
Won't it all be chucked out?

1612
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:02,439
I'll know I've left it in order.
That's all I can do now.

1613
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:04,591
- Yeah, but he won't...
- Leave him alone.

1614
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,797
George had his revenge on Denton.
Hot coffee in the lap.

1615
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:13,710
- Poor Mr. Denton.
- I'm glad I caught you.

1616
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:18,355
I assume the inspector won't
keep everyone beyond tomorrow.

1617
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,473
- He hasn't spoken to some servants.
- Dexter. We're going home.

1618
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:24,830
I was asking how long
our guests will be staying.

1619
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,679
Mrs. Croft has meals to arrange,
and one of the maids

1620
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:30,474
- is anxious to get away.
- No need to worry about that.

1621
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:34,555
I've no interest in the servants,
only those connected to the dead man.

1622
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:36,913
I see. Thank you.

1623
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:38,633
Do you have a light, Inspector?

1624
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:40,596
Yes.

1625
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:44,470
I think we can
let them all go home.

1626
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:46,352
Got their addresses after all.

1627
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,875
Dexter will be here tomorrow
to confirm that.

1628
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:52,279
But don't worry,
it doesn't end here.

1629
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,190
Whoever he is, I'll find him.
I always do.

1630
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,356
Inspector. Matches.

1631
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,233
Yes. Thank you.

1632
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:08,359
- Sir, it's this way.
- Yes, yes.

1633
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:11,990
There's a way out that way,
but we'll take your way.

1634
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:30,230
Beg your pardon, just collecting
Mr. Nesbitt's shoes.

1635
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:43,395
These stairs are
the easiest way up.

1636
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,711
- Thank you...
- George, sir.

1637
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:47,389
George.

1638
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,589
You naughty, naughty girl.

1639
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,194
Poor bloke.

1640
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:04,195
We were in the ironing room
and a visiting maid came in.

1641
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,551
He must think
I did it on purpose.

1642
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:09,276
- You won't tell, will you?
- I won't tell.

1643
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:12,359
You're lucky you're in kitchen
and not under Mrs. Wilson.

1644
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:15,399
She'd have sniffed you out
without my help.

1645
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:30,075
Do you think Sir William
was in love with you?

1646
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,959
No, I was a bit of fun,
that's all.

1647
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:36,909
And you?

1648
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,793
No, I didn't love him.
I didn't mind him, but...

1649
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,514
I liked the way he'd talk.
He only talked to me

1650
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:50,269
because he was sick of her,
but I liked it. He said...

1651
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,072
I could be what I wanted

1652
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:53,872
as long as I wanted it enough.

1653
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:57,719
You're not sorry then,

1654
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:01,157
- even the way things turned out?
- No, I'm not sorry.

1655
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:06,149
Time for a change. Who knows?
Could be the making of me.

1656
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:10,157
What did he use to day?
Carpe Diem. Seize the day.

1657
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:17,635
What's up?

1658
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,438
What did I say?
Where are you going?

1659
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:30,469
Who is it?

1660
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:34,348
What are you doing?

1661
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:45,114
Get back to your room.
You don't want to be caught here.

1662
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,915
You didn't really
dislike him, did you?

1663
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:53,709
Not really.

1664
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,916
At least, not enough
to kill him.

1665
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,438
You can't have.

1666
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:08,919
You didn't know him.

1667
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:12,154
You'd have to hate him,
and why would you?

1668
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:16,191
Can't a man hate his own father?

1669
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:24,832
Sir William McCordle...

1670
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,359
was my father.

1671
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:31,229
He didn't know it,

1672
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:33,708
but he was.

1673
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:40,311
- You said you were an orphan.
- I said I grew up in an orphanage.

1674
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:52,515
Before I left, a group of us
broke in and took our files.

1675
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:58,275
I found my birth certificate:
Mother's name, father unknown.

1676
01:50:58,480 --> 01:50:59,390
I found this photograph.

1677
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,638
And they had my admission form.

1678
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,195
I was two days old.
Guess who brought me to the door.

1679
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:09,989
- That doesn't mean he...
- Yes, it does.

1680
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:14,875
I found out she worked
in one of his factories.

1681
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,839
She wasn't the only one.

1682
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:24,994
The authorities didn't know
or want to. They took his babies

1683
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:27,079
and took his money.

1684
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:31,237
What happened to your mother?

1685
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:33,949
She died.

1686
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:41,359
Is that why you took the job
with Lord Stockbridge?

1687
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,952
To get to Sir William?

1688
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:48,113
- To poison him?
- I didn't poison him.

1689
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:52,592
- What?
- I didn't poison him.

1690
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:57,277
Then you didn't kill him!

1691
01:51:58,480 --> 01:51:59,754
Did you stab him?

1692
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:02,635
Even if you did,

1693
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,353
he was already dead.

1694
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:08,519
Whoever did it must've known.
You can't stab a corpse and not know.

1695
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,915
When was the last time
you stabbed a corpse?

1696
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,118
Who really murdered him then?

1697
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:20,189
I don't know.

1698
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:24,679
I don't care.

1699
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,798
I've wanted to do that ever since
I first set eyes on you.

1700
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,275
Mr. Jennings.

1701
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,676
Wilson, Mrs. Wilson...

1702
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,192
Dorothy. I need your help.

1703
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,957
Of course, Mrs. Wilson.
Are you all right?

1704
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:36,513
No-one must see him like this.

1705
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:41,470
- Mr. Jennings, come on.
- Come on, Mr. Jennings.

1706
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:47,394
- All right. Bed time.
- No. This way, Mr. Jennings.

1707
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:49,793
Bedtime now. Come on.

1708
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:57,672
- My reference?
- You'll get your reference.

1709
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,434
Into bed now.

1710
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,754
Take his trousers off,
would you Dorothy?

1711
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,034
I couldn't do that,
Mrs. Wilson.

1712
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:13,437
Take his trousers off.
Come on, girl.

1713
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,268
Is Lady Sylvia?
She's not here, is he?

1714
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:28,633
- Who is it?
- I'm ever so sorry, sir.

1715
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:32,355
- Sorry for what?
- I'm not meant to wake you.

1716
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,836
Why does everyone treat me like
one of these stupid snobs?

1717
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:38,429
I spent half the week
downstairs with all of you.

1718
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,791
You can't be
on both teams at once.

1719
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:47,196
It's official.
They're off after breakfast.

1720
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:49,436
Thank God for that
What about him?

1721
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,354
He's going too. As soon as
he's seen Mr. Jennings.

1722
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:55,870
Are you all right?
You sound a bit funny.

1723
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:59,675
Just too many fags.
They'll be the death of me.

1724
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:01,313
Here, you finish it.

1725
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:06,389
- Did you tell the police that stuff?
- I did not. Sorry if I shock you,

1726
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:09,068
but the plain fact is he only
got what he deserved.

1727
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:11,428
There, I've said it.

1728
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:14,951
I can't stop thinking about
those girls.

1729
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,634
- The ones that got, you know.
- I'm not surprised,

1730
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:20,159
the way you carry on.

1731
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:22,476
Just see it never happens to you.

1732
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:28,150
No, and even if it did, I couldn't
part with my baby for a job.

1733
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:30,319
I'm very glad to hear it.

1734
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,035
Who is it?

1735
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:35,636
Don't mind me.

1736
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:39,594
- Inspector asked me to take a look.
- Is the inspector with you?

1737
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:41,473
We're working from

1738
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:44,956
the station. See if we can't manage
things better from here.

1739
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:48,438
What about the poison?
Have you traced that at least?

1740
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,235
Hardly.

1741
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,828
This house is a poisoner's paradise.

1742
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,639
We've found the stuff
in practically...

1743
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:01,909
every room.

1744
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:06,312
Unfortunately, no one's got
a police record.

1745
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:09,272
Except you, of course.

1746
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:11,514
Perhaps the butler did it.

1747
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:25,509
I had a brother who was
a conscientious objector.

1748
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:28,798
He did a bit of time, too.

1749
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:34,397
Do they know upstairs you refused
to fight and were sent to prison?

1750
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:38,958
I'd forget about it if I were you.

1751
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:41,757
Not everyone's cut out to be
a soldier.

1752
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:06,954
Did you remember the others boxes?

1753
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:10,357
- Everything's in the car.
- Wonderful.

1754
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,357
Darling. Here I come.

1755
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:15,313
- I can't wait to leave this place.
- Let's go.

1756
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,716
What are we supposed to do now?

1757
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:22,159
Freddie, do try to stop being so
frightened all the time.

1758
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:26,990
- Have I made a fool of myself?
- Maybe, but you're my fool.

1759
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,156
Anthony, I just...

1760
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:33,074
I wanted to remind you of the
conversation we had the other night.

1761
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:36,635
Perhaps this is not the most
appropriate moment, but

1762
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:40,196
when you get the Sudan you'll
need an expert,

1763
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,317
and I'm your man.

1764
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:45,155
Did you ask her?

1765
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:47,874
- No.
- I think that's a good thing.

1766
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:49,877
Servants' hall gossip says

1767
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:53,356
- it won't be till her mother dies.
- Jeremy, you are so...

1768
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:55,710
If that's the case, it's too long
for you to wait.

1769
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:57,755
You can do better.

1770
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,952
Have you checked your room?

1771
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:05,437
You mustn't leave anything behind.

1772
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:07,758
I'm sure mummy's going to sell
the house.

1773
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:09,229
Isobel.

1774
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:10,998
Isobel! Isobel!

1775
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:13,759
Kent's taking over the studio.

1776
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,678
He loves Charlie Chan
and he hates Winfield Sheehan.

1777
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,069
No more rewrites

1778
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:20,474
and I can cast whoever I like.

1779
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:23,433
- That was painless, wasn't it?
- No it wasn't.

1780
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:25,828
Not for me, anyway.

1781
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:29,638
Careful. Watch yourself.

1782
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:38,674
Do they know?

1783
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:41,036
- No.
- Do you think they might notice?

1784
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:42,389
I don't care.

1785
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:43,715
Hey, you there.

1786
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,399
Where are you going?

1787
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:47,829
To the station.

1788
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:49,839
You want a ride to London?

1789
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:54,748
Sure, why not?

1790
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,517
- Hop in.
- Thank you.

1791
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:03,549
There you go.

1792
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:05,758
Good luck.

1793
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:09,875
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
- That gives me room for maneuver.

1794
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,352
Keep your hands to yourself.

1795
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,833
You Brits don't have a sense
of humor, do you?

1796
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:20,836
We do if something's funny, sir.

1797
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:22,672
- Mr. Jennings.
- Be quick about.

1798
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:24,994
Honestly,

1799
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:28,909
it's getting so expensive leaving
something for the housemaids,

1800
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,473
one might as well take a suite

1801
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:31,829
at the Ritz.

1802
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:37,079
What about William's little maid?
I never saw her again after dinner.

1803
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:38,595
Elsie?

1804
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,599
- She's gone.
- It's a pity really.

1805
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:45,429
It was a good idea to have
someone whose sorry he's dead.

1806
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:51,190
- Did you have a nice ride?
- I feel guilty. Everyone's gone.

1807
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:54,919
Apart from you and Louisa.
Why don't you stay for luncheon?

1808
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:58,192
No. Best be off.
Leave you in peace.

1809
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,754
You will telephone about
the funeral plans?

1810
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:07,797
- Don't come if it's a bore.
- Of course I'm coming.

1811
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:11,871
- What will you do with this place?
- I don't know.

1812
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,234
Will you keep it?

1813
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:17,028
It's so difficult.

1814
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:20,594
Does one really want
the bother nowadays?

1815
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:24,838
I could shut it up

1816
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:28,077
and make a decision when
my head stops spinning.

1817
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:30,555
Mrs. Wilson could manage till
you're ready.

1818
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:33,274
She could manage all right.
Let's not worry about that.

1819
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:37,918
She'll get rid of
the wretched Mrs. Croft.

1820
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:40,111
- Why are those two such enemies?
- I don't know.

1821
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,639
They were both workers in
one of William's sweatshops.

1822
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:46,556
Mrs. Croft was the senior then.
She was the cook.

1823
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,439
And Mrs. Wilson,
a lowly factory worker.

1824
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:52,513
Now that she's gone up,
poor Crofty can't abide it.

1825
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:54,515
Usual rubbish.

1826
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,110
Was there ever a Mr. Wilson?

1827
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:59,038
- I can't imagine it.
- Nor could I.

1828
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:01,871
Although, funnily enough,
I think there must have been.

1829
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:04,478
Really? You amaze me.

1830
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:09,310
She might have changed her name,
but when she worked with William

1831
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:13,832
she was something different.
Parks or Parker or Parkinson,

1832
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:15,275
or something like that.

1833
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:19,589
Come in.

1834
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:25,275
- You're busy.
- I was checking the linen rotation.

1835
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:29,314
If left it to the maids,
twenty sheets would be rags.

1836
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,828
Why did you do it?

1837
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:49,918
How did you know it was him?

1838
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:55,431
- The name or the photograph.
- Yes, the photograph.

1839
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:00,635
It's a miracle that survived.
His mother put it into his blanket.

1840
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:03,513
I suppose she wanted him to have
something of hers.

1841
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:05,278
Does he know what happened to her?

1842
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:09,952
They said she died just after
he was born.

1843
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:12,991
She didn't die, she gave him away.

1844
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:19,632
He promised the boy would be
adopted, that he knew the family.

1845
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:20,955
Turns out we all

1846
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:23,913
clung to that dream.
All us girls.

1847
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:26,432
A better start in life
for our children.

1848
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:32,557
And he was dumping them
in some God-forsaken place.

1849
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:35,679
And I believed him.

1850
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:40,590
I suppose it was easier that way.
My sister never forgave me.

1851
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:44,909
- Your sister?
- Mrs. Croft. She's my sister.

1852
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:47,634
Didn't you know?
She kept hers.

1853
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:51,590
It was very hard for her.
She lost her job and the baby died.

1854
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:53,793
Scarlet fever.

1855
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:58,118
I made him take her back.
She never forgave me for that either.

1856
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,468
But even if Robert is your son,

1857
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:03,989
how did you know that
he meant to harm his father?

1858
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:09,436
What gift separates a good servant
from the others?

1859
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:12,517
It's the gift of anticipation.

1860
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:16,477
I am a good servant.
I'm better. I'm the best.

1861
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:17,829
I'm the perfect servant.

1862
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:22,552
When they're hungry, food is ready.
When they're tired, a bed.

1863
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:25,196
I know before they know it.

1864
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:31,119
Are you going to tell him?

1865
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:36,517
Why? What purpose
would it possibly serve?

1866
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:43,917
- What if they find out what happened?
- Not much a crime

1867
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:45,838
to stab a dead man, is it?

1868
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:49,552
They can never touch him.
That's important. His life.

1869
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:52,909
And your life?

1870
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,798
I'm the perfect servant.
I have no life.

1871
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:06,069
- Her Ladyship's leaving now, miss.
- Thank you, George.

1872
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:13,597
You should go now, Miss Trentham.

1873
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:34,072
- Here you are.
- Most generous. Thank you.

1874
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:37,317
Let us know if there's
anything we can do to help.

1875
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:41,636
- Are you going to go away at all?
- Not once the shooting's finished.

1876
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:44,839
- Thank you for your help last night.
- You don't have to thank me.

1877
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:47,395
I would kill for Mr. Jennings
if I had to.

1878
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,996
Don't cry, Jane, they'll hear you.

1879
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:21,155
Come on.

1880
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:24,798
You did what you felt

1881
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,558
was best for him at the time.

1882
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:28,753
I see that now.

1883
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:31,869
Lizzie...

1884
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:34,873
I've lost him.

1885
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:39,078
I've lost him.
He'll never know me now.

1886
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:44,118
- My boy.
- At least your boy's alive.

1887
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,918
He's alive.

1888
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:50,358
That's what matters.

1889
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:08,755
- So, you're leaving.
- Yes.

1890
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:13,635
Goodbye then.

1891
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:18,231
- Goodbye.
- Parks.

1892
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,870
Goodbye, my dear. Chin up.

1893
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:29,237
Heavens, what a relief to be going.

1894
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:32,311
It'll take me a month to recover.

1895
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:35,557
Mary, Mary dear...
Do you think if there's

1896
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:37,876
a trial I might have to testify

1897
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:39,953
in court? Or you?

1898
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:42,677
I can't think of anything worse.

1899
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:47,271
Imagine a person being hanged
because of what one said in court.

1900
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:52,068
I know. And what purpose could it
possibly serve anyway?

1901
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:01,269
Goodbye.

1902
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:28,397
Somewhere there's another land

1903
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:32,316
different from this world below,

1904
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,338
far more mercifully planned

1905
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:39,310
than the cruel place we know.

1906
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:44,314
Innocence and peace are there

1907
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:48,629
all is good that is desired,

1908
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:54,070
faces there are always fair

1909
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:59,431
love grows never old nor tired.

1910
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:06,795
We shall never find that lovely land

1911
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:09,469
of Might-Have-Been,

1912
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:13,670
I can never be your king

1913
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:17,429
nor you can be my queen.

1914
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:22,114
Days my pass,
and years my pass

1915
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:26,029
and seas may lie between.

1916
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:32,230
We shall never find that
lovely land

1917
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:35,672
of Might-Have-Been.
