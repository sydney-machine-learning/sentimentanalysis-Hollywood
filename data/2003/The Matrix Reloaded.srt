1
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,425
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:49,778
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:13,928
I'm in.

4
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,834
We're almost there.

5
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:12,963
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,049
I understand, sir. It's just that...

7
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:18,594
...I'm scoping some serious
sentinel activity up here.

8
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:59,176
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

9
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:02,471
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...

10
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:05,307
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

11
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:09,478
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

12
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,480
What's that, sir?

13
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:13,524
To trust me.

14
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,651
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

15
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,865
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

16
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:24,410
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

17
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:25,661
Yes, sir.

18
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:36,755
Still can't sleep?

19
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:40,092
You wanna talk?

20
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:44,805
They're just dreams.

21
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:49,518
If you're afraid of something...

22
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,520
I just wish...

23
00:05:52,188 --> 00:05:54,440
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

24
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:56,442
That's all.

25
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,944
I just wish I knew.

26
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:03,365
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

27
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:04,575
Here you are.

28
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:08,204
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

29
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the Osiris.</i>

30
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,419
The machines are digging.

31
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,381
They're boring from the surface
down to Zion.

32
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:22,134
- Mother...
- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.

33
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,802
How fast are they moving?

34
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:27,348
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.

35
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:29,975
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.

36
00:06:30,142 --> 00:06:33,687
<i>- What about the scans from the Osiris?
- They can't be accurate.</i>

37
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:35,773
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

38
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,400
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

39
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,069
- That's right.
- That can't be.

40
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:41,904
Why not?

41
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:45,824
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

42
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:50,746
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

43
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:53,082
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

44
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:54,750
Niobe.

45
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:59,505
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

46
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:03,467
...it's become difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.

47
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:06,387
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Lines are crawling with them.

48
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:10,349
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

49
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:11,642
What are we gonna do?

50
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:14,103
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.

51
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:17,022
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

52
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:22,319
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

53
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:25,155
A strategy is still being formulated.

54
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:26,991
I'm sure it is.

55
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:44,008
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

56
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:46,343
- We should proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

57
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,553
I don't know.

58
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,514
...however, I must ask one of you
for help.

59
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:56,395
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. Those of you that do...

60
00:07:56,562 --> 00:07:59,106
...know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

61
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:03,527
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

62
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:07,031
...the Oracle must be consulted.

63
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:17,208
If we return and recharge now...

64
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:21,128
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

65
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:23,172
Do you understand what you're asking?

66
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:26,175
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

67
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:29,053
...in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

68
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,348
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

69
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:37,061
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

70
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:39,855
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

71
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:41,941
What happens when you
get back to Zion...

72
00:08:42,107 --> 00:08:44,527
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

73
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:45,903
He won't.

74
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,241
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

75
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,702
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

76
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:55,412
You got 36 hours.

77
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:00,042
I'm looking for Neo.

78
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:03,587
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

79
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:07,007
A gift.

80
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:10,094
You see, he set me free.

81
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:14,765
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

82
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:18,352
- Who was that?
- How did you know someone was here?

83
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,979
He gave you this.

84
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:27,152
He said you set him free.

85
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:31,448
Is everything all right, sir?

86
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:34,451
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

87
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:36,829
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

88
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:38,664
Go.

89
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:49,550
Hiya, fellas.

90
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:50,843
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

91
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,261
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

92
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,930
- He is still...
- Only human.

93
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:03,355
Upgrades.

94
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:00,830
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

95
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:03,666
It's happening exactly as before.

96
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,502
Well, not exactly.

97
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:12,341
- What happened?
- I can't figure it out.

98
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,176
Agents just came out of nowhere.

99
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:17,346
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

100
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:20,432
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

101
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:22,017
Where is he now?

102
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:25,229
He's doing his Superman thing.

103
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:16,655
Where are you?

104
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:24,914
<i>This is the Nebuchadnezzar,
requesting access through Gate Three.</i>

105
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,422
<i>Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.</i>

106
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:35,090
<i>Roger that, Control,</i>

107
00:12:35,257 --> 00:12:38,761
This is Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

108
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:42,765
<i>We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach. Let's open her up.</i>

109
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:51,273
<i>You are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven,</i>

110
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,150
Roger that, Control.

111
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:03,369
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

112
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:06,288
No place like it.

113
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:24,181
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

114
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:16,108
<i>The Nebuchadnezzar is down,
Bay Seven,</i>

115
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:17,443
Understood.

116
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:28,704
Captain Mifune.

117
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:30,956
Captain Morpheus.

118
00:14:31,123 --> 00:14:33,959
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

119
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:37,546
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands...

120
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:41,967
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

121
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:44,720
- Link.
- Sir?

122
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:47,473
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

123
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,183
Understood, sir.

124
00:14:56,357 --> 00:14:58,776
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

125
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:02,071
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

126
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:05,449
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

127
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,285
What happened?

128
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:11,914
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

129
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:14,750
Yeah, she can do that.

130
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,085
Neo!

131
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:19,964
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

132
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,091
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

133
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:24,969
You know what they say
about the life you save.

134
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:26,929
I didn't save his life.

135
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:30,474
Hiya, Neo.

136
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:34,270
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

137
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:38,107
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

138
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:41,026
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

139
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:42,862
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

140
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:46,699
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

141
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,125
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

142
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:59,044
I've been thinking about it,
and I've made my decision.

143
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:00,671
Let me guess.

144
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:03,132
<i>I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

145
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:07,678
Morpheus hasn't filled the other
positions, except for you, Link.

146
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:09,221
I'm sure he has reasons...

147
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:12,725
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

148
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:14,435
You know, it's fate.

149
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:16,145
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

150
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:18,856
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.

151
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:21,567
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

152
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:24,320
You saved yourself.

153
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:43,923
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

154
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:45,674
I spoke to the other captains.

155
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:48,677
I wanted to offer you a chance
to explain your actions.

156
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:51,514
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

157
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,057
You were given an order...

158
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:55,267
...to return to Zion.
- I did.

159
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,186
You asked for one ship
to remain behind.

160
00:16:57,353 --> 00:17:00,022
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

161
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:02,900
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

162
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:06,487
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

163
00:17:06,654 --> 00:17:08,614
I don't want to hear that shit!

164
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:11,450
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

165
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:15,037
I care about one thing: Stopping
that army from destroying this city.

166
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:18,040
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

167
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:22,795
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

168
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:24,380
How?

169
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:27,341
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

170
00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:30,135
Not everyone believes what you believe.

171
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:32,388
My beliefs do not require them to.

172
00:17:40,563 --> 00:17:44,483
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

173
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,403
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

174
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,531
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

175
00:17:50,698 --> 00:17:53,868
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

176
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:02,293
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

177
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:18,267
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

178
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:20,769
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

179
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:24,815
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set
foot on a ship for the rest of your life.

180
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:28,277
Then I am grateful
that it is not up to you.

181
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,619
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

182
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:39,997
- Captain.
- Councillor.

183
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:43,542
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

184
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,085
The presence of the fleet...

185
00:18:45,252 --> 00:18:47,796
...and the persistence of rumors
must be addressed.

186
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:50,466
The people must be told
what is happening.

187
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:52,343
Of course, councillor.

188
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:58,307
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

189
00:18:58,474 --> 00:19:01,477
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

190
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:04,730
A panic is not what anyone wants.

191
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:08,234
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

192
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:15,407
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

193
00:19:15,574 --> 00:19:17,701
That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.

194
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:22,081
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

195
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,124
Consider that in the past six months...

196
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,335
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

197
00:19:26,502 --> 00:19:29,505
This attack is an act of desperation.

198
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:33,509
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

199
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:37,513
I hope you're right, captain.

200
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,391
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

201
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,143
It is simply a matter of time.

202
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:46,772
My stop.

203
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:48,357
See you soon.

204
00:19:48,524 --> 00:19:49,984
Hopefully not too soon.

205
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,320
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

206
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:04,498
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

207
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:07,084
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

208
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:10,588
<i>- How long do we charge the Neb?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.</i>

209
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:14,967
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

210
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:43,746
<i>Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.</i>

211
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:47,416
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

212
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,668
<i>I have a daughter on the Icarus.</i>

213
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:51,754
No, wait.

214
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:54,423
It's all right. They need you.

215
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,842
- I need you.
- I know.

216
00:20:57,384 --> 00:20:59,678
There's time.

217
00:21:04,642 --> 00:21:06,769
Where's my puss...?

218
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:09,271
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

219
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:11,065
God!

220
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:13,192
Uncle Link!

221
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,946
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

222
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:19,281
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

223
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:20,991
- Yeah!
- Okay!

224
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:22,868
Okay? All right.

225
00:21:23,035 --> 00:21:26,080
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

226
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,457
One, two, three, lift!

227
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:31,794
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

228
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:34,672
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

229
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:37,800
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

230
00:21:38,342 --> 00:21:40,886
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

231
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:42,888
You be careful with her.

232
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:45,850
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

233
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:50,062
Out the door! Both of you, march!

234
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:52,273
- Bye!
- Bye!

235
00:21:58,654 --> 00:22:00,197
I'm gonna get what?

236
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:03,200
Every ship up there's
been home two...

237
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:05,703
<i>...even three times more
than the Nebuchadnezzar,</i>

238
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,582
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

239
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:13,169
- We'll be when you operate another ship.
- I can't do that.

240
00:22:13,335 --> 00:22:14,837
- Why?
- You know why.

241
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:18,174
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

242
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:21,427
Maybe. But it's too late now.

243
00:22:21,594 --> 00:22:24,221
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

244
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:27,099
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

245
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:30,227
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

246
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,361
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

247
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,656
I'm afraid of it.

248
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:46,869
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

249
00:22:47,536 --> 00:22:49,371
It won't.

250
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:51,373
How can you say that to me?

251
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,501
Because of Morpheus.

252
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:58,297
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

253
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:02,676
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

254
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:06,388
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

255
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:10,017
...after being on that ship and seeing
Neo do the things he can do...

256
00:23:10,184 --> 00:23:11,894
...I gotta say...

257
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:14,104
...I'm starting to believe him too.

258
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:21,654
Be careful, Link.

259
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:29,370
Please be careful.

260
00:23:38,337 --> 00:23:39,505
They started yet?

261
00:23:39,672 --> 00:23:41,882
Only Councillor Hamann's
opening prayer.

262
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:45,135
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

263
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:47,930
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

264
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:52,351
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

265
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,186
...our children.

266
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,898
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

267
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:01,277
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

268
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:04,738
...and who stand here beside us.

269
00:24:04,947 --> 00:24:08,617
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

270
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:11,996
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

271
00:24:12,163 --> 00:24:17,543
...but who I believe has something
to say that we all need to hear.

272
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:20,129
I give you Morpheus.

273
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:43,819
Zion! Hear me!

274
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,948
It is true what many of you have heard.

275
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:52,119
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

276
00:24:52,286 --> 00:24:56,207
...that army is drawing nearer
to our home.

277
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:02,338
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

278
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:09,178
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

279
00:25:09,678 --> 00:25:14,600
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

280
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:16,936
Why?

281
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:20,189
Because I believe something you do not?

282
00:25:20,356 --> 00:25:22,191
No!

283
00:25:22,483 --> 00:25:27,446
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

284
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:31,534
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

285
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,037
...but because of the path
that lies behind me.

286
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:39,875
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

287
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:44,797
I remember that for 100 years they
have sent their armies to destroy us.

288
00:25:44,964 --> 00:25:51,053
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

289
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:54,932
We are still here!

290
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:03,732
Tonight...

291
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:07,278
...let us send a message to that army.

292
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:10,489
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

293
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:14,535
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

294
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:17,830
...of earth, steel and stone.

295
00:26:17,997 --> 00:26:23,252
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

296
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:27,965
Tonight, let us make them remember:

297
00:26:28,132 --> 00:26:33,095
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

298
00:26:56,452 --> 00:26:58,454
I remember.

299
00:26:59,288 --> 00:27:01,707
I remember you used to dance.

300
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:06,629
I remember you were pretty good.

301
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:10,633
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

302
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:14,220
...that will never change.

303
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:17,431
Niobe!

304
00:27:22,144 --> 00:27:23,896
Some things do change.

305
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:45,000
Excuse me.

306
00:27:56,846 --> 00:28:00,349
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

307
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:04,520
I was thinking, everyone is here.

308
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:07,356
Follow me.

309
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:31,936
Neo, what is it?

310
00:31:32,228 --> 00:31:34,480
What's wrong?

311
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:38,400
It's okay, you can tell me.

312
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:41,278
Trinity...

313
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:44,240
Don't be afraid.

314
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:46,742
I can't lose you.

315
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:48,786
You're not gonna lose me.

316
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:55,793
You feel this?

317
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,753
I'm never letting go.

318
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:37,626
Good night, Zion.

319
00:32:37,793 --> 00:32:40,462
Sweet dreams.

320
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:52,308
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

321
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:55,102
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

322
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:57,354
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.

323
00:32:57,521 --> 00:32:59,815
You first.

324
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:13,579
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

325
00:33:25,508 --> 00:33:29,386
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

326
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:22,064
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

327
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,776
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

328
00:34:26,235 --> 00:34:29,780
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

329
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,616
So could I.

330
00:34:35,744 --> 00:34:38,247
It's nice tonight.

331
00:34:38,747 --> 00:34:41,167
Very calm.

332
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:44,086
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

333
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:46,922
Not everyone.

334
00:34:47,214 --> 00:34:51,927
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

335
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:56,140
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

336
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,312
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

337
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:05,941
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

338
00:35:06,108 --> 00:35:09,278
That you are in fact still human.

339
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:16,785
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

340
00:35:16,952 --> 00:35:19,997
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

341
00:35:20,164 --> 00:35:22,708
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

342
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:37,848
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

343
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:43,103
That's how it is with people. Nobody
cares how it works as long as it works.

344
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,564
I like it down here.

345
00:35:45,731 --> 00:35:51,529
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

346
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:53,531
These machines are keeping us alive...

347
00:35:53,697 --> 00:35:56,826
...while other machines
are coming to kill us.

348
00:35:57,243 --> 00:36:02,081
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

349
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:05,459
...and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

350
00:36:05,626 --> 00:36:08,337
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

351
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:11,966
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

352
00:36:12,132 --> 00:36:15,135
And when I look at these machines...

353
00:36:15,302 --> 00:36:20,391
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

354
00:36:20,683 --> 00:36:23,561
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

355
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:26,981
Of course not. How could they?

356
00:36:27,147 --> 00:36:29,692
The idea is pure nonsense...

357
00:36:30,192 --> 00:36:33,320
...but it does make one wonder just...

358
00:36:33,487 --> 00:36:35,072
...what is control?

359
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:38,367
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

360
00:36:38,742 --> 00:36:43,205
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

361
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:47,209
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

362
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:49,461
Although if we did,
we'd have to consider...

363
00:36:49,628 --> 00:36:51,589
...what would happen to our lights...

364
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:54,425
...our heat, our air.

365
00:36:55,426 --> 00:36:59,555
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

366
00:36:59,722 --> 00:37:02,349
No. No point.

367
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:07,146
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

368
00:37:07,938 --> 00:37:11,734
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

369
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:13,569
Good point.

370
00:37:14,278 --> 00:37:18,449
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

371
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:21,869
There is so much in this world...

372
00:37:22,036 --> 00:37:24,955
...that I do not understand.

373
00:37:26,749 --> 00:37:31,504
See that machine? It has something
to do with recycling our water supply.

374
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,673
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

375
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,928
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

376
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:44,934
I have absolutely no idea how you are
able to do some of the things you do.

377
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:49,271
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

378
00:37:50,147 --> 00:37:55,277
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

379
00:38:01,784 --> 00:38:03,452
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

380
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:08,457
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

381
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:13,128
It's time to go.

382
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:16,549
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

383
00:38:16,715 --> 00:38:21,136
I don't know. Maybe
the prophecy's true, maybe it's not.

384
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,849
All I know is,
that ship needs an operator.

385
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:28,310
Right now, that operator's me.

386
00:38:28,936 --> 00:38:31,021
I know.

387
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:37,653
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it.

388
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,906
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

389
00:38:41,198 --> 00:38:44,160
It's always brought me luck.

390
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:48,455
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

391
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:53,169
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

392
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:57,506
Just keep it with you. Please.

393
00:38:57,673 --> 00:38:59,758
For me.

394
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:04,471
Okay.

395
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:26,118
- Neo!
- How the hell...?

396
00:39:26,535 --> 00:39:28,704
Bane.

397
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:30,206
Is something wrong?

398
00:39:30,372 --> 00:39:32,082
No, I'm fine.

399
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:35,044
I just wanted to catch you to say...

400
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:37,046
...good luck.

401
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:40,424
Thanks.

402
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:43,010
We'll see you.

403
00:39:44,595 --> 00:39:47,681
Neo! Just in time.

404
00:39:47,848 --> 00:39:50,184
- You're gonna see the Oracle?
- There's no time.

405
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:51,977
I had to give something to Neo.

406
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:55,397
A gift from one of the orphans.

407
00:39:55,564 --> 00:39:58,984
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

408
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,321
He said you'd understand.

409
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,117
Thanks.

410
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:17,127
<i>I was just told you cleared
the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.</i>

411
00:40:17,294 --> 00:40:19,255
That is correct.

412
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:21,382
Am I still in charge
of our defense system?

413
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:22,842
Of course.

414
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:27,596
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

415
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,349
I understand that, commander.

416
00:40:30,516 --> 00:40:33,102
<i>Then why did you allow
the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?</i>

417
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:38,148
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

418
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:42,945
Be careful.

419
00:41:11,974 --> 00:41:14,185
Hello.

420
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:28,032
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

421
00:41:31,076 --> 00:41:35,581
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

422
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:37,541
Apologize for what?

423
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:40,002
For this.

424
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:39,562
Good.

425
00:42:42,064 --> 00:42:45,234
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

426
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:47,611
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

427
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:51,824
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone...

428
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:54,243
...until you fight them.

429
00:42:54,785 --> 00:42:58,247
Come. She's waiting.

430
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:15,181
Where the hell did they go?

431
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:18,267
These are back doors, aren't they?

432
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:21,353
Programmer access.

433
00:43:22,438 --> 00:43:26,192
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

434
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:31,363
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

435
00:43:33,115 --> 00:43:35,951
Are you a programmer?

436
00:43:36,118 --> 00:43:38,454
Then what are you?

437
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:44,126
I protect that which matters most.

438
00:44:03,646 --> 00:44:07,024
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

439
00:44:07,441 --> 00:44:10,236
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

440
00:44:13,447 --> 00:44:15,825
My goodness, look at you.

441
00:44:16,158 --> 00:44:18,994
You turned out all right, didn't you?

442
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:21,372
- How do you feel?
- I...

443
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:25,125
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

444
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:28,003
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

445
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:32,842
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

446
00:44:43,978 --> 00:44:46,522
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

447
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,608
So...

448
00:44:51,694 --> 00:44:54,113
...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

449
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:56,115
You're not human, are you?

450
00:44:56,282 --> 00:44:58,868
It's tough to get any more obvious
than that.

451
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:04,874
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

452
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:09,461
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

453
00:45:09,628 --> 00:45:12,798
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

454
00:45:12,965 --> 00:45:15,551
...another kind of control.

455
00:45:15,718 --> 00:45:17,303
Keep going.

456
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:20,222
I suppose
the most obvious question is...

457
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:24,310
...how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

458
00:45:25,352 --> 00:45:28,606
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

459
00:45:28,772 --> 00:45:32,443
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

460
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:36,155
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

461
00:45:36,322 --> 00:45:41,118
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

462
00:45:42,411 --> 00:45:44,580
Candy?

463
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:49,460
Do you already know if I'll take it?

464
00:45:49,627 --> 00:45:51,712
Wouldn't be much of an oracle
if I didn't.

465
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:55,090
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

466
00:45:55,257 --> 00:45:59,303
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

467
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:04,099
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

468
00:46:09,647 --> 00:46:12,608
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

469
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,946
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

470
00:46:17,196 --> 00:46:19,949
I love candy.

471
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:22,952
But why help us?

472
00:46:23,118 --> 00:46:26,622
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

473
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:30,251
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
The future.

474
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:34,630
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

475
00:46:35,464 --> 00:46:40,386
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

476
00:46:40,553 --> 00:46:43,222
Look. See those birds?

477
00:46:43,472 --> 00:46:46,851
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

478
00:46:47,017 --> 00:46:50,938
A program was written to watch over
the trees and the wind...

479
00:46:51,105 --> 00:46:52,857
...the sunrise and sunset.

480
00:46:53,107 --> 00:46:55,985
There are programs running
all over the place.

481
00:46:56,152 --> 00:47:00,614
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

482
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:04,618
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

483
00:47:04,785 --> 00:47:08,873
Well, you hear about them all the time.

484
00:47:09,456 --> 00:47:12,334
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

485
00:47:12,501 --> 00:47:17,423
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

486
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:22,178
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

487
00:47:22,344 --> 00:47:24,680
...is the system assimilating
some program...

488
00:47:24,847 --> 00:47:29,518
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

489
00:47:29,685 --> 00:47:32,688
Programs hacking programs.

490
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:35,733
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

491
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,862
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

492
00:47:40,279 --> 00:47:44,200
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

493
00:47:44,366 --> 00:47:48,913
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

494
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,043
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

495
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,879
...or return to the source.

496
00:47:58,547 --> 00:48:01,842
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

497
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:04,512
Where you must go.

498
00:48:04,678 --> 00:48:08,891
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

499
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:12,895
...in your dreams, haven't you?

500
00:48:13,062 --> 00:48:15,898
A door made of light?

501
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,695
What happens when you go through
the door?

502
00:48:23,823 --> 00:48:26,826
I see Trinity...

503
00:48:26,992 --> 00:48:30,162
...and something happens...

504
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:32,248
...something bad.

505
00:48:32,414 --> 00:48:36,418
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

506
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:41,340
- Do you see her die?
- No.

507
00:48:42,132 --> 00:48:45,177
You have the sight now, Neo.

508
00:48:45,344 --> 00:48:48,347
You are looking at the world
without time.

509
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:50,933
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

510
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,854
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

511
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,190
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

512
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,236
No, you've already made the choice.

513
00:49:02,403 --> 00:49:04,947
Now you have to understand it.

514
00:49:05,573 --> 00:49:06,949
No.

515
00:49:07,116 --> 00:49:10,369
I can't do that. I won't.

516
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:13,455
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

517
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:17,126
Because you're the One.

518
00:49:19,295 --> 00:49:22,298
What if I can't?

519
00:49:22,464 --> 00:49:24,466
What happens if I fail?

520
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:28,053
Then Zion will fall.

521
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,399
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

522
00:49:40,566 --> 00:49:43,861
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

523
00:49:44,028 --> 00:49:45,070
The Keymaker?

524
00:49:45,237 --> 00:49:48,866
Yes. He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

525
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:52,786
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

526
00:49:52,953 --> 00:49:56,499
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

527
00:49:56,665 --> 00:49:59,543
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

528
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:04,548
What do all men with power want?
More power.

529
00:50:05,257 --> 00:50:08,511
Be there at that exact time...

530
00:50:08,677 --> 00:50:11,347
...and you will have a chance.

531
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:14,391
We must go.

532
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:19,939
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

533
00:50:20,523 --> 00:50:23,400
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

534
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:26,320
But for what it's worth...

535
00:50:27,363 --> 00:50:31,033
...you've made a believer out of me.

536
00:50:32,326 --> 00:50:34,453
Good luck, kiddo.

537
00:50:54,348 --> 00:50:57,351
Mr. Anderson.

538
00:50:58,394 --> 00:51:00,396
Did you get my package?

539
00:51:00,563 --> 00:51:02,731
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

540
00:51:03,899 --> 00:51:06,777
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent.

541
00:51:06,944 --> 00:51:10,823
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

542
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:13,576
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

543
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:16,787
Our connection.

544
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:19,623
I don't fully understand how it happened.

545
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:23,169
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

546
00:51:23,335 --> 00:51:26,005
...something overwritten or copied.

547
00:51:26,172 --> 00:51:28,883
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

548
00:51:29,049 --> 00:51:32,136
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

549
00:51:32,303 --> 00:51:33,971
And what reason is that?

550
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:38,392
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

551
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,812
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

552
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:45,483
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

553
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:47,485
...but it happened anyway.

554
00:51:48,194 --> 00:51:51,363
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

555
00:51:53,365 --> 00:51:57,953
Afterward, I knew the rules, I
understood what I was supposed to do...

556
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,123
...but I didn't.

557
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,461
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

558
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,465
...compelled to disobey.

559
00:52:10,049 --> 00:52:13,802
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

560
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:17,932
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

561
00:52:18,098 --> 00:52:21,310
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

562
00:52:21,477 --> 00:52:26,315
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

563
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:28,025
Congratulations.

564
00:52:28,776 --> 00:52:31,111
Thank you.

565
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:36,325
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

566
00:52:36,492 --> 00:52:41,664
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

567
00:52:41,831 --> 00:52:46,710
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

568
00:52:46,877 --> 00:52:50,798
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

569
00:52:50,965 --> 00:52:54,343
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

570
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:59,348
...we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

571
00:52:59,515 --> 00:53:02,518
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

572
00:53:02,685 --> 00:53:04,520
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

573
00:53:04,687 --> 00:53:09,400
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

574
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:12,027
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

575
00:53:12,194 --> 00:53:16,574
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

576
00:53:18,534 --> 00:53:20,619
Purpose.

577
00:53:23,706 --> 00:53:25,583
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

578
00:53:28,627 --> 00:53:32,214
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

579
00:55:19,071 --> 00:55:21,532
- You.
- Yes, me.

580
00:55:25,703 --> 00:55:28,581
Me, me, me.

581
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,129
Me too.

582
00:57:42,882 --> 00:57:43,924
More.

583
00:58:46,195 --> 00:58:49,031
It is inevitable.

584
00:58:49,448 --> 00:58:50,866
Come on, get out of there.

585
00:59:34,076 --> 00:59:36,412
Are you all right?

586
00:59:37,496 --> 00:59:39,415
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

587
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:42,918
- Now there's more than one of them?
- A lot more.

588
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:46,881
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

589
00:59:47,047 --> 00:59:49,508
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

590
00:59:49,675 --> 00:59:53,888
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

591
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:56,807
...but I know what it felt like.
- What?

592
00:59:57,725 --> 01:00:01,437
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

593
01:00:01,604 --> 01:00:03,189
It felt like dying.

594
01:00:03,522 --> 01:00:06,400
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

595
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:10,404
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

596
01:00:10,571 --> 01:00:13,115
These points of intersection
are crucial...

597
01:00:13,282 --> 01:00:16,076
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

598
01:00:16,243 --> 01:00:20,289
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

599
01:00:20,456 --> 01:00:24,126
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

600
01:00:24,293 --> 01:00:27,630
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

601
01:00:27,796 --> 01:00:31,634
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

602
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,804
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

603
01:00:36,096 --> 01:00:40,643
You have our leave to prepare our
defense by any and all means necessary.

604
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:43,479
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

605
01:00:43,729 --> 01:00:47,066
<i>...we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

606
01:00:47,316 --> 01:00:49,819
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

607
01:00:51,445 --> 01:00:55,407
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

608
01:00:55,574 --> 01:00:59,328
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

609
01:00:59,495 --> 01:01:03,040
...can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

610
01:01:03,207 --> 01:01:05,543
<i>It could take one ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

611
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:08,754
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

612
01:01:08,921 --> 01:01:11,924
Careful, commander.

613
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:15,469
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

614
01:01:15,636 --> 01:01:19,515
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

615
01:01:19,682 --> 01:01:22,852
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

616
01:01:23,018 --> 01:01:25,479
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains...

617
01:01:25,646 --> 01:01:27,356
There's no need for such an order.

618
01:01:27,523 --> 01:01:31,068
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

619
01:01:31,527 --> 01:01:36,782
<i>The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

620
01:01:36,949 --> 01:01:41,120
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

621
01:01:42,413 --> 01:01:46,208
<i>Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.</i>

622
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:49,295
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

623
01:01:49,461 --> 01:01:51,922
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

624
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,758
Is there another?

625
01:01:55,551 --> 01:01:59,263
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

626
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:01,307
- Listen...
- Shut your hole, Bane...

627
01:02:01,473 --> 01:02:02,975
...before I put you in one.

628
01:02:12,818 --> 01:02:14,570
Is there no other?

629
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:17,239
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

630
01:02:17,406 --> 01:02:20,367
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

631
01:02:20,826 --> 01:02:24,330
<i>Captain Niobe of the Logos
will answer the councillor's call.</i>

632
01:02:24,497 --> 01:02:26,749
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

633
01:02:26,957 --> 01:02:32,046
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

634
01:02:36,759 --> 01:02:39,345
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

635
01:02:39,512 --> 01:02:40,554
Why?

636
01:02:41,847 --> 01:02:45,100
Because some things
never change, Jason...

637
01:02:45,267 --> 01:02:47,603
...and some things do.

638
01:03:04,036 --> 01:03:05,454
What can you see, Neo?

639
01:03:05,621 --> 01:03:07,957
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

640
01:03:08,123 --> 01:03:09,708
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

641
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:11,836
Is that good for us or bad for us?

642
01:03:12,545 --> 01:03:15,673
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

643
01:03:16,298 --> 01:03:17,842
Bad for us.

644
01:03:18,259 --> 01:03:19,760
Here we go.

645
01:03:27,768 --> 01:03:30,688
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

646
01:03:31,147 --> 01:03:34,984
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

647
01:03:35,151 --> 01:03:36,193
Follow me.

648
01:03:58,174 --> 01:04:04,054
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.

649
01:04:04,221 --> 01:04:05,639
Right?

650
01:04:05,806 --> 01:04:08,142
And the legendary Morpheus.

651
01:04:08,976 --> 01:04:13,856
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

652
01:04:14,023 --> 01:04:17,485
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

653
01:04:18,402 --> 01:04:21,697
Something to eat? Drink?

654
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:25,034
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

655
01:04:25,201 --> 01:04:27,703
For the sake of appearances.

656
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:31,332
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

657
01:04:31,499 --> 01:04:32,875
Who has time?

658
01:04:33,042 --> 01:04:36,587
But then, if we do not ever take time,
how can we ever have time?

659
01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:43,677
Chàteau Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

660
01:04:43,844 --> 01:04:46,764
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

661
01:04:46,931 --> 01:04:51,101
I have sampled every language. French
is my favorite. Fantastic language...

662
01:04:51,268 --> 01:04:53,395
...especially to curse with.

663
01:04:57,399 --> 01:05:02,029
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

664
01:05:03,781 --> 01:05:05,491
You know why we are here.

665
01:05:07,284 --> 01:05:12,164
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

666
01:05:12,581 --> 01:05:18,420
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

667
01:05:18,712 --> 01:05:21,131
We are looking for the Keymaker.

668
01:05:21,841 --> 01:05:26,303
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

669
01:05:26,512 --> 01:05:29,431
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

670
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,352
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

671
01:05:33,561 --> 01:05:39,316
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

672
01:05:39,483 --> 01:05:42,653
...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

673
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:44,947
But do you?

674
01:05:45,156 --> 01:05:47,449
You think you do, but you do not.

675
01:05:47,658 --> 01:05:50,828
You are here
because you were sent here.

676
01:05:51,036 --> 01:05:54,123
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

677
01:05:55,332 --> 01:05:57,626
It is, of course, the way of all things.

678
01:05:57,835 --> 01:06:00,504
You see, there is only one constant...

679
01:06:00,671 --> 01:06:04,800
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

680
01:06:05,009 --> 01:06:06,635
Causality.

681
01:06:06,844 --> 01:06:09,096
Action, reaction.

682
01:06:09,305 --> 01:06:13,517
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

683
01:06:13,684 --> 01:06:15,394
No. Wrong.

684
01:06:15,603 --> 01:06:20,149
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

685
01:06:20,357 --> 01:06:22,401
...and those without.

686
01:06:23,986 --> 01:06:27,156
Look there at that woman.

687
01:06:27,865 --> 01:06:31,744
My God, just look at her...

688
01:06:32,036 --> 01:06:34,705
...affecting everyone around her.

689
01:06:34,872 --> 01:06:39,585
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

690
01:06:39,877 --> 01:06:43,589
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

691
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:48,052
...a very special dessert.

692
01:06:52,389 --> 01:06:54,809
I wrote it myself.

693
01:06:55,017 --> 01:06:58,187
It starts so simply...

694
01:06:58,395 --> 01:07:02,942
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

695
01:07:04,026 --> 01:07:05,653
...poetry.

696
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,196
First...

697
01:07:07,738 --> 01:07:13,160
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

698
01:07:13,744 --> 01:07:16,330
You can see it, Neo, yes?

699
01:07:16,997 --> 01:07:19,542
She does not understand why.

700
01:07:19,834 --> 01:07:22,211
Is it the wine? No.

701
01:07:22,419 --> 01:07:24,755
What is it then? What is the reason?

702
01:07:25,422 --> 01:07:27,716
And soon it does not matter.

703
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:30,928
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

704
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:37,393
...and all that matters
is the feeling itself.

705
01:07:37,893 --> 01:07:40,980
And this is the nature of the universe.

706
01:07:41,147 --> 01:07:43,649
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

707
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:46,402
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

708
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:50,573
Beneath our poised appearance...

709
01:07:50,781 --> 01:07:56,036
...the truth is, we are completely...

710
01:07:58,956 --> 01:08:01,792
...out of control.

711
01:08:07,173 --> 01:08:12,011
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

712
01:08:12,469 --> 01:08:17,892
Our only hope, our only peace, is to
understand it, to understand the why.

713
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,520
"Why" is what separates us from them...

714
01:08:21,687 --> 01:08:23,939
...you from me.

715
01:08:24,148 --> 01:08:27,860
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

716
01:08:28,068 --> 01:08:31,322
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

717
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:34,283
Another link in the chain.

718
01:08:34,533 --> 01:08:35,784
But fear not.

719
01:08:35,993 --> 01:08:39,830
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

720
01:08:40,039 --> 01:08:42,625
...I will tell you what to do next.

721
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:47,963
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

722
01:08:48,214 --> 01:08:52,426
Her time is almost up.

723
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:57,014
<i>Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say adieu and goodbye.</i>

724
01:08:57,223 --> 01:08:59,683
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

725
01:08:59,892 --> 01:09:06,232
The Keymaker is mine, and I see
no reason why I should give him up.

726
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:10,486
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

727
01:09:10,653 --> 01:09:15,324
<i>Please, ma cherie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.</i>

728
01:09:15,533 --> 01:09:18,869
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

729
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:22,456
<i>Cause and effect. Au revoir.</i>

730
01:09:27,545 --> 01:09:30,631
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

731
01:09:39,515 --> 01:09:40,975
Well, that didn't go so well.

732
01:09:41,183 --> 01:09:43,519
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

733
01:09:43,727 --> 01:09:45,855
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

734
01:09:46,522 --> 01:09:47,815
Or didn't do something.

735
01:09:48,023 --> 01:09:51,277
No, what happened couldn't have
happened any other way.

736
01:09:51,443 --> 01:09:55,197
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

737
01:09:57,491 --> 01:10:00,744
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

738
01:10:07,751 --> 01:10:09,795
Get out.

739
01:10:11,755 --> 01:10:18,053
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

740
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:24,185
A long time ago, when we first
came here, it was so different.

741
01:10:25,936 --> 01:10:28,606
He was so different.

742
01:10:30,441 --> 01:10:33,027
He was like you.

743
01:10:35,779 --> 01:10:39,533
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

744
01:10:40,326 --> 01:10:42,578
- What?
- A kiss.

745
01:10:42,995 --> 01:10:44,079
Excuse me?

746
01:10:45,623 --> 01:10:49,502
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

747
01:10:51,462 --> 01:10:55,007
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

748
01:10:55,299 --> 01:10:57,259
It's all over you both.

749
01:10:57,927 --> 01:11:02,473
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

750
01:11:03,808 --> 01:11:09,563
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

751
01:11:09,814 --> 01:11:11,607
Just a sample.

752
01:11:11,816 --> 01:11:14,819
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

753
01:11:17,029 --> 01:11:21,951
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

754
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:24,286
Why should we trust you?

755
01:11:24,495 --> 01:11:28,457
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

756
01:11:35,589 --> 01:11:37,716
All right.

757
01:11:38,008 --> 01:11:41,804
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

758
01:11:43,055 --> 01:11:45,057
All right.

759
01:11:51,438 --> 01:11:53,232
Terrible. Forget it.

760
01:11:56,235 --> 01:11:57,695
Wait.

761
01:11:58,612 --> 01:12:00,156
Okay.

762
01:12:37,234 --> 01:12:39,278
Yes.

763
01:12:39,904 --> 01:12:42,364
That's it.

764
01:12:57,171 --> 01:13:02,593
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

765
01:13:05,596 --> 01:13:06,972
Come with me.

766
01:13:38,045 --> 01:13:39,755
Not again.

767
01:13:43,217 --> 01:13:45,803
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

768
01:13:46,512 --> 01:13:48,848
These fellas work for my husband.

769
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:52,852
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

770
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,603
Aren't you, boys?

771
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:55,771
Yes, mistress.

772
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:58,649
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

773
01:13:58,858 --> 01:14:02,987
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

774
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:08,742
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

775
01:14:08,951 --> 01:14:12,997
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

776
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:20,880
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

777
01:14:21,088 --> 01:14:23,632
...or you can stay there and die.

778
01:14:24,592 --> 01:14:26,552
He's in the ladies' room!

779
01:14:32,641 --> 01:14:34,518
Hurry.

780
01:15:00,127 --> 01:15:03,297
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

781
01:15:03,464 --> 01:15:05,341
I've been waiting for you.

782
01:15:12,223 --> 01:15:15,851
My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

783
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:23,067
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

784
01:15:23,234 --> 01:15:26,237
There is no cause for this. What cause?

785
01:15:26,403 --> 01:15:30,699
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

786
01:15:30,866 --> 01:15:33,536
Lipstick? Lipstick.

787
01:15:33,744 --> 01:15:37,540
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

788
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:41,961
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

789
01:15:44,421 --> 01:15:47,508
Woman, this is nothing.

790
01:15:47,716 --> 01:15:53,222
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

791
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:55,391
Have fun.

792
01:16:01,939 --> 01:16:03,566
All right.

793
01:16:03,774 --> 01:16:05,484
All right.

794
01:16:05,776 --> 01:16:08,529
Let us find out where this goes.

795
01:16:08,737 --> 01:16:11,574
You two, get the Keymaker.

796
01:16:18,122 --> 01:16:20,082
That's a nice trick.

797
01:16:20,416 --> 01:16:21,584
I cannot go back.

798
01:16:22,126 --> 01:16:24,086
I'll handle them.

799
01:16:24,628 --> 01:16:27,089
Handle us? You'll handle us?

800
01:16:27,298 --> 01:16:30,718
You know, your predecessors
had much more respect.

801
01:16:44,148 --> 01:16:46,192
Okay, you have some skill.

802
01:16:48,402 --> 01:16:50,362
Kill him.

803
01:17:50,548 --> 01:17:52,591
You see? He's just a man.

804
01:20:07,393 --> 01:20:10,146
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

805
01:20:12,273 --> 01:20:16,235
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

806
01:20:16,443 --> 01:20:21,615
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

807
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:45,055
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

808
01:20:49,226 --> 01:20:51,103
Close it, quick!

809
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:58,402
Could we move along?

810
01:21:01,989 --> 01:21:03,532
Run!

811
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:21,801
Step away from the door.

812
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:28,182
We owe you for that.

813
01:21:30,476 --> 01:21:31,602
Just like new.

814
01:21:31,936 --> 01:21:33,395
Drop your weapon.

815
01:21:38,776 --> 01:21:40,569
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

816
01:21:40,778 --> 01:21:42,321
He can handle himself.

817
01:21:45,407 --> 01:21:46,450
Get in back.

818
01:22:24,155 --> 01:22:25,281
Shit.

819
01:22:25,823 --> 01:22:27,283
<i>- Operator.
- Link, where am I?</i>

820
01:22:27,867 --> 01:22:31,036
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

821
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:33,622
<i>- Really?
- It'll take me a while to get an exit,</i>

822
01:22:34,165 --> 01:22:35,166
<i>- Shit!
- What?</i>

823
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:38,085
The twins are after Morpheus and
Trinity. They don't have a way out.

824
01:22:38,252 --> 01:22:41,589
<i>- Where are they?
- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south,</i>

825
01:22:58,397 --> 01:22:59,940
<i>- Operator,
- Get us out of here.</i>

826
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:02,902
<i>- Won't be easy,
- I know. We're inside the core network.</i>

827
01:23:03,068 --> 01:23:05,654
<i>The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass,</i>

828
01:23:05,863 --> 01:23:07,907
<i>- Off the freeway.
- Yes, sir,</i>

829
01:23:08,115 --> 01:23:11,827
<i>- Fine, we'll make it.
- I should... Oh, shit! Look out behind you!</i>

830
01:23:16,874 --> 01:23:18,417
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

831
01:23:26,717 --> 01:23:27,843
Hold on!

832
01:23:44,902 --> 01:23:47,363
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.

833
01:23:47,571 --> 01:23:49,281
Are you watching this, Link?

834
01:23:49,448 --> 01:23:53,035
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

835
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:56,080
Any suggestions?

836
01:23:57,957 --> 01:23:59,917
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

837
01:24:07,424 --> 01:24:10,261
Straight here. You'll hit
a connecting tunnel to the 101.

838
01:24:10,427 --> 01:24:11,804
<i>- Got it,
- You sure about this?</i>

839
01:24:11,971 --> 01:24:14,807
The freeway, I mean. In 14 years
of operating, I've never seen...

840
01:24:15,015 --> 01:24:16,976
Link, what did I tell you?

841
01:24:17,309 --> 01:24:19,562
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

842
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:22,231
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

843
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:24,567
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

844
01:24:24,775 --> 01:24:27,361
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

845
01:24:27,611 --> 01:24:29,488
Then let us hope...

846
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:31,073
...that I was wrong.

847
01:24:42,543 --> 01:24:44,003
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

848
01:24:44,211 --> 01:24:45,838
We've been sent to bring you in.

849
01:24:46,005 --> 01:24:49,091
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

850
01:24:49,258 --> 01:24:51,218
<i>- Where is he?
- Just follow the sirens.</i>

851
01:24:58,809 --> 01:25:00,686
Repeat, they're approaching the...

852
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:08,110
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

853
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:12,716
<i>Shots fired,</i>

854
01:26:15,344 --> 01:26:17,221
Move!

855
01:28:07,206 --> 01:28:10,376
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

856
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:58,424
Trinity.

857
01:28:58,883 --> 01:28:59,967
Get him out of here.

858
01:29:03,637 --> 01:29:05,681
Come on!

859
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:24,200
Crush him.

860
01:29:54,730 --> 01:29:55,731
Morpheus.

861
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:57,399
He's okay. Keep moving.

862
01:29:58,442 --> 01:30:00,236
Let's go.

863
01:30:05,991 --> 01:30:08,118
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

864
01:30:08,327 --> 01:30:10,621
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle...

865
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:12,206
Wait.

866
01:30:13,624 --> 01:30:15,084
Cancel that.

867
01:30:15,251 --> 01:30:17,419
You are handy.

868
01:30:17,628 --> 01:30:19,505
Jump on.

869
01:32:46,944 --> 01:32:48,821
- She means nothing.
- Find the exile.

870
01:32:50,114 --> 01:32:51,115
We have them.

871
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:53,576
<i>One-Adam-twelve, please respond,</i>

872
01:33:00,082 --> 01:33:01,792
Get down.

873
01:35:12,798 --> 01:35:14,425
Gotcha.

874
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:16,218
She's good.

875
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:22,892
You are no longer necessary.

876
01:35:29,607 --> 01:35:33,277
We do only what we're meant to do.

877
01:35:34,945 --> 01:35:38,491
Then you are meant for one more thing:
Deletion.

878
01:35:39,492 --> 01:35:41,368
Go kick his ass.

879
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:34,171
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

880
01:36:34,922 --> 01:36:36,382
What is that?

881
01:37:06,245 --> 01:37:09,081
Yes! Yes!

882
01:37:15,713 --> 01:37:18,215
<i>Sir, we have confirmation
from the Icarus.</i>

883
01:37:18,424 --> 01:37:20,801
First two ships are in position
for counterattack.

884
01:37:21,093 --> 01:37:22,094
Good.

885
01:37:23,137 --> 01:37:24,138
Any change?

886
01:37:24,346 --> 01:37:27,099
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

887
01:37:27,266 --> 01:37:30,352
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

888
01:37:30,561 --> 01:37:33,063
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

889
01:37:33,939 --> 01:37:35,566
Yes, sir.

890
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:10,392
<i>There is a building,</i>

891
01:38:10,601 --> 01:38:16,273
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

892
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:18,317
...and no stair can reach.

893
01:38:19,026 --> 01:38:25,074
<i>This level is filled with doors,
These doors lead to many places,</i>

894
01:38:25,282 --> 01:38:27,576
Hidden places.

895
01:38:27,952 --> 01:38:31,539
But one door is special.

896
01:38:31,747 --> 01:38:33,916
One door leads to the source.

897
01:38:42,299 --> 01:38:46,679
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

898
01:38:46,887 --> 01:38:51,350
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

899
01:38:51,642 --> 01:38:54,311
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

900
01:38:54,478 --> 01:38:57,481
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

901
01:38:57,648 --> 01:39:00,985
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

902
01:39:01,569 --> 01:39:06,282
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

903
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:09,326
You'd have to take out a city block
to kill the power.

904
01:39:09,493 --> 01:39:13,164
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

905
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:16,459
<i>There is a power station,</i>

906
01:39:16,667 --> 01:39:18,878
<i>It must be destroyed,</i>

907
01:39:19,086 --> 01:39:23,382
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

908
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:28,804
<i>The core network of the grid
must be accessed,</i>

909
01:39:29,013 --> 01:39:31,849
<i>The emergency system
must be deactivated,</i>

910
01:39:32,016 --> 01:39:33,392
<i>What do you need us for?</i>

911
01:39:33,601 --> 01:39:35,728
Neo could take them out
easier than we could.

912
01:39:35,936 --> 01:39:37,646
- There's no time.
- Why?

913
01:39:37,855 --> 01:39:40,941
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

914
01:39:41,150 --> 01:39:43,402
But another connection
must first be made.

915
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:48,073
<i>- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds,</i>

916
01:39:48,282 --> 01:39:49,825
<i>Just over five minutes,</i>

917
01:39:50,034 --> 01:39:52,244
<i>That is the length and breadth
of the window,</i>

918
01:39:52,453 --> 01:39:54,705
Only the One can open the door...

919
01:39:54,955 --> 01:39:57,875
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

920
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:00,669
How do you know all this?

921
01:40:00,878 --> 01:40:06,008
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

922
01:40:06,217 --> 01:40:11,722
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

923
01:40:22,483 --> 01:40:25,236
Neo, I know something's wrong.

924
01:40:25,945 --> 01:40:27,947
You don't have to tell me.

925
01:40:28,155 --> 01:40:31,867
I just want you to know that I'm here.

926
01:40:35,454 --> 01:40:36,914
All must be done as one.

927
01:40:41,669 --> 01:40:43,295
Can't hurt.

928
01:40:46,882 --> 01:40:48,926
If one fails...

929
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,470
<i>,,, all fail,</i>

930
01:40:51,804 --> 01:40:55,599
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

931
01:40:56,851 --> 01:41:00,229
<i>At midnight, we will strike,</i>

932
01:41:00,896 --> 01:41:01,939
Hey!

933
01:41:02,148 --> 01:41:06,068
- You count sheep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

934
01:41:16,287 --> 01:41:18,497
Okay, they're inside.

935
01:41:18,664 --> 01:41:21,125
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

936
01:41:23,878 --> 01:41:24,920
Oh, shit.

937
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:33,762
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

938
01:41:35,306 --> 01:41:37,433
<i>Tonight is not an accident,</i>

939
01:41:38,809 --> 01:41:40,769
<i>There are no accidents,</i>

940
01:41:42,188 --> 01:41:47,193
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

941
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:52,990
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

942
01:41:53,157 --> 01:41:56,619
...I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

943
01:41:56,994 --> 01:41:59,288
<i>I see purpose,</i>

944
01:42:02,041 --> 01:42:08,339
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

945
01:42:08,547 --> 01:42:13,511
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

946
01:42:13,719 --> 01:42:17,056
...the very meaning of our lives.

947
01:42:17,223 --> 01:42:21,352
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

948
01:42:21,977 --> 01:42:23,854
I promise you, if I can, I will.

949
01:42:25,231 --> 01:42:28,567
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

950
01:42:29,527 --> 01:42:31,487
...no matter what...

951
01:42:31,695 --> 01:42:33,989
...to stay out of the Matrix?

952
01:42:35,115 --> 01:42:36,909
Why?

953
01:42:45,126 --> 01:42:46,168
Please.

954
01:42:48,295 --> 01:42:49,588
All right.

955
01:42:52,967 --> 01:42:55,427
What is it, Niobe?

956
01:42:55,636 --> 01:42:59,765
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

957
01:42:59,932 --> 01:43:03,185
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

958
01:43:03,394 --> 01:43:07,356
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

959
01:43:07,815 --> 01:43:10,401
But how would that be different
from any other day?

960
01:43:19,910 --> 01:43:26,375
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

961
01:43:26,667 --> 01:43:29,587
<i>Death can come for us at any time,,,</i>

962
01:43:30,129 --> 01:43:31,922
<i>,,, in any place,</i>

963
01:43:32,089 --> 01:43:33,966
Incoming. Incoming!

964
01:43:35,968 --> 01:43:37,595
Incoming!

965
01:43:43,517 --> 01:43:45,936
Now consider the alternative.

966
01:43:46,145 --> 01:43:50,691
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

967
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:55,279
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

968
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:59,283
Isn't that worth fighting for?

969
01:44:00,409 --> 01:44:02,995
Isn't that worth dying for?

970
01:44:03,954 --> 01:44:06,540
- Time?
- Three minutes.

971
01:44:06,749 --> 01:44:07,833
Almost there.

972
01:44:27,937 --> 01:44:29,313
It is done.

973
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:30,731
Find the others.

974
01:44:31,899 --> 01:44:34,109
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.

975
01:44:34,318 --> 01:44:36,987
- What about Soren?
- There.

976
01:44:37,154 --> 01:44:38,948
They're still inside, but...

977
01:44:39,865 --> 01:44:40,866
They're not moving.

978
01:45:05,057 --> 01:45:06,934
That's it, let's go.

979
01:45:09,103 --> 01:45:10,896
Call Neo now.

980
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:17,736
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

981
01:45:21,866 --> 01:45:25,327
Everything is operational. The
emergency system is rerouting power.

982
01:45:31,041 --> 01:45:33,169
Jesus.

983
01:45:33,377 --> 01:45:37,423
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

984
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:39,550
The hell it is.

985
01:45:40,301 --> 01:45:41,594
What are you...? Trinity!

986
01:45:42,928 --> 01:45:45,848
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.

987
01:45:46,056 --> 01:45:48,184
We're talking less than five minutes.

988
01:45:48,392 --> 01:45:50,853
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.

989
01:45:51,061 --> 01:45:54,565
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

990
01:45:55,900 --> 01:45:59,862
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

991
01:46:01,071 --> 01:46:03,532
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

992
01:46:06,785 --> 01:46:09,872
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.

993
01:46:27,973 --> 01:46:29,517
<i>- Operator.
- I'm in,</i>

994
01:46:29,725 --> 01:46:31,852
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

995
01:46:32,478 --> 01:46:36,607
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

996
01:46:36,816 --> 01:46:42,154
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

997
01:46:42,363 --> 01:46:45,282
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

998
01:46:45,449 --> 01:46:50,955
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

999
01:46:51,121 --> 01:46:53,791
I want exactly what you want.

1000
01:46:53,958 --> 01:46:56,001
I want everything.

1001
01:46:56,502 --> 01:46:58,963
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

1002
01:46:59,171 --> 01:47:00,965
Go ahead, shoot.

1003
01:47:01,132 --> 01:47:06,387
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

1004
01:47:17,815 --> 01:47:21,402
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

1005
01:47:22,319 --> 01:47:24,363
Hold it right there, little lady.

1006
01:47:33,706 --> 01:47:35,499
If you can't beat us...

1007
01:47:35,666 --> 01:47:37,460
Join us.

1008
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:40,713
Morpheus!

1009
01:47:54,351 --> 01:47:57,438
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

1010
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:12,203
One minute.

1011
01:48:21,504 --> 01:48:22,505
Come on.

1012
01:48:23,714 --> 01:48:25,591
Come on.

1013
01:48:26,217 --> 01:48:28,093
Please.

1014
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:39,563
Kill them.

1015
01:48:47,446 --> 01:48:48,447
They're in.

1016
01:48:48,656 --> 01:48:50,616
<i>I don't believe it,</i>

1017
01:49:06,173 --> 01:49:08,300
It was meant to be.

1018
01:49:08,467 --> 01:49:13,806
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

1019
01:49:22,606 --> 01:49:26,902
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

1020
01:49:32,449 --> 01:49:35,619
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1021
01:50:27,922 --> 01:50:29,298
Hello, Neo.

1022
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:33,594
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1023
01:50:33,803 --> 01:50:37,389
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1024
01:50:37,681 --> 01:50:39,058
You have many questions.

1025
01:50:39,225 --> 01:50:41,811
Though the process has altered
your consciousness...

1026
01:50:42,019 --> 01:50:43,979
...you remain irrevocably human.

1027
01:50:44,188 --> 01:50:47,733
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

1028
01:50:48,192 --> 01:50:52,238
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1029
01:50:52,404 --> 01:50:56,075
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1030
01:50:56,992 --> 01:50:58,619
Why am I here?

1031
01:50:58,786 --> 01:51:02,665
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1032
01:51:02,873 --> 01:51:05,167
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1033
01:51:05,376 --> 01:51:09,421
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1034
01:51:09,630 --> 01:51:12,466
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1035
01:51:12,633 --> 01:51:17,096
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1036
01:51:17,429 --> 01:51:19,723
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1037
01:51:19,932 --> 01:51:24,395
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1038
01:51:24,562 --> 01:51:28,482
...which has led you, inexorably...

1039
01:51:29,483 --> 01:51:30,693
...here.

1040
01:51:30,901 --> 01:51:34,947
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

1041
01:51:35,156 --> 01:51:38,909
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1042
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:41,704
<i>Others? How many?
What others?</i>

1043
01:51:41,912 --> 01:51:44,206
The Matrix is older than you know.

1044
01:51:44,415 --> 01:51:46,917
I count from the emergence
of one integral anomaly...

1045
01:51:47,126 --> 01:51:50,963
...to the emergence of the next.
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1046
01:51:51,172 --> 01:51:53,591
<i>Five before me?
He's lying, Bullshit,</i>

1047
01:51:53,799 --> 01:51:57,303
<i>There are only two possible explanations,
There were five before me,</i>

1048
01:51:57,511 --> 01:51:58,762
<i>Either no one told me,,,</i>

1049
01:52:00,055 --> 01:52:04,018
...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

1050
01:52:04,226 --> 01:52:07,480
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1051
01:52:07,688 --> 01:52:11,066
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1052
01:52:11,275 --> 01:52:14,528
<i>You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>

1053
01:52:14,695 --> 01:52:16,489
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

1054
01:52:16,655 --> 01:52:19,825
<i>You can't make me do anything,
You old, white prick!</i>

1055
01:52:22,119 --> 01:52:23,579
Choice.

1056
01:52:23,788 --> 01:52:25,581
The problem is choice.

1057
01:52:47,853 --> 01:52:51,440
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

1058
01:52:51,649 --> 01:52:53,442
Flawless, sublime.

1059
01:52:53,651 --> 01:52:57,112
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1060
01:52:57,822 --> 01:53:00,199
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1061
01:53:00,407 --> 01:53:03,744
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

1062
01:53:03,911 --> 01:53:06,831
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1063
01:53:07,039 --> 01:53:11,001
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1064
01:53:11,752 --> 01:53:15,798
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1065
01:53:17,216 --> 01:53:19,552
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1066
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,804
...because it required a lesser mind.

1067
01:53:21,971 --> 01:53:27,893
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1068
01:53:28,352 --> 01:53:32,731
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1069
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:37,736
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1070
01:53:37,903 --> 01:53:43,826
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1071
01:53:44,493 --> 01:53:46,745
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1072
01:53:47,288 --> 01:53:49,540
As I was saying, she stumbled
upon a solution...

1073
01:53:49,748 --> 01:53:51,459
...whereby 99 percent of subjects...

1074
01:53:51,667 --> 01:53:54,670
...accepted the program,
as long as they were given a choice...

1075
01:53:54,837 --> 01:53:58,799
...even if they were only aware of
the choice at a near unconscious level.

1076
01:53:59,008 --> 01:54:02,428
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1077
01:54:02,595 --> 01:54:06,557
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1078
01:54:06,765 --> 01:54:09,435
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1079
01:54:09,852 --> 01:54:13,981
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1080
01:54:14,148 --> 01:54:18,194
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1081
01:54:18,402 --> 01:54:20,196
This is about Zion.

1082
01:54:20,654 --> 01:54:24,283
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1083
01:54:24,492 --> 01:54:28,871
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1084
01:54:29,205 --> 01:54:30,206
Bullshit.

1085
01:54:30,414 --> 01:54:33,584
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1086
01:54:33,793 --> 01:54:40,216
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1087
01:54:40,424 --> 01:54:44,386
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1088
01:54:57,149 --> 01:54:58,400
The function of the One...

1089
01:54:58,609 --> 01:55:01,695
...is now to return to the source,
allowing a dissemination...

1090
01:55:01,904 --> 01:55:05,157
...of the code you carry,
reinserting the prime program.

1091
01:55:05,741 --> 01:55:09,703
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1092
01:55:09,912 --> 01:55:13,165
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1093
01:55:13,332 --> 01:55:17,878
Failure to comply with this process will
result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1094
01:55:18,045 --> 01:55:20,339
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1095
01:55:20,548 --> 01:55:23,092
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1096
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:27,513
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1097
01:55:27,847 --> 01:55:31,892
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1098
01:55:32,726 --> 01:55:36,313
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1099
01:55:36,522 --> 01:55:38,983
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1100
01:55:39,191 --> 01:55:43,028
...to accept responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

1101
01:55:49,535 --> 01:55:52,037
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1102
01:55:53,122 --> 01:55:56,917
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1103
01:55:57,126 --> 01:55:58,669
...a contingent affirmation...

1104
01:55:58,836 --> 01:56:01,589
...that was meant to create
a profound attachment...

1105
01:56:01,755 --> 01:56:05,301
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1106
01:56:05,509 --> 01:56:07,803
While the others experience this
in a general way...

1107
01:56:08,012 --> 01:56:10,931
...your experience is far more specific...

1108
01:56:11,307 --> 01:56:14,143
...vis-a-vis love.

1109
01:56:15,186 --> 01:56:16,812
Trinity!

1110
01:56:19,106 --> 01:56:23,402
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

1111
01:56:23,819 --> 01:56:24,820
No.

1112
01:56:25,571 --> 01:56:29,700
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1113
01:56:29,867 --> 01:56:32,953
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1114
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:37,082
...as both beginning and end.

1115
01:56:37,291 --> 01:56:38,751
There are two doors.

1116
01:56:38,959 --> 01:56:42,296
The door to your right leads
to the source and the salvation of Zion.

1117
01:56:42,922 --> 01:56:45,758
The door to your left leads back
to the Matrix, to her...

1118
01:56:45,925 --> 01:56:49,178
...and to the end of your species.

1119
01:56:49,386 --> 01:56:53,766
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

1120
01:56:53,933 --> 01:56:57,436
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

1121
01:56:57,603 --> 01:57:01,649
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

1122
01:57:01,857 --> 01:57:03,567
...the onset of an emotion...

1123
01:57:03,776 --> 01:57:07,112
...designed specifically
to overwhelm logic and reason.

1124
01:57:07,279 --> 01:57:11,909
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

1125
01:57:12,076 --> 01:57:18,541
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

1126
01:57:23,587 --> 01:57:27,716
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

1127
01:57:27,883 --> 01:57:31,554
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

1128
01:57:31,762 --> 01:57:36,058
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

1129
01:57:36,267 --> 01:57:37,643
We won't.

1130
01:57:45,109 --> 01:57:47,319
We got a serious situation, sir.

1131
01:57:47,778 --> 01:57:48,821
Oh, no.

1132
01:58:48,506 --> 01:58:50,466
- What was that?
- It's moving faster...

1133
01:58:50,674 --> 01:58:52,051
...than anything I've seen.

1134
01:59:42,685 --> 01:59:44,478
Holy shit, he caught her.

1135
01:59:58,409 --> 02:00:00,202
Neo, I had to.

1136
02:00:00,411 --> 02:00:02,121
I know.

1137
02:00:07,209 --> 02:00:09,712
The bullet is still inside.

1138
02:00:20,514 --> 02:00:22,391
Trinity...

1139
02:00:23,642 --> 02:00:25,352
...don't you quit on me now.

1140
02:00:34,528 --> 02:00:37,072
I'm sorry.

1141
02:00:43,621 --> 02:00:45,873
Trinity.

1142
02:00:55,883 --> 02:00:57,843
Trinity...

1143
02:00:58,010 --> 02:00:59,804
...I know you can hear me.

1144
02:01:00,596 --> 02:01:03,098
I'm not letting go.

1145
02:01:03,307 --> 02:01:04,934
I can't.

1146
02:01:06,143 --> 02:01:08,354
I love you too damn much.

1147
02:01:37,049 --> 02:01:38,300
I can't take this.

1148
02:01:42,096 --> 02:01:45,182
I guess this makes us even.

1149
02:01:57,862 --> 02:01:59,822
I don't understand it.

1150
02:01:59,989 --> 02:02:02,992
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

1151
02:02:03,159 --> 02:02:06,162
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

1152
02:02:06,370 --> 02:02:09,206
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

1153
02:02:09,373 --> 02:02:13,669
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

1154
02:02:14,128 --> 02:02:15,754
- What?
- How do you know that?

1155
02:02:16,213 --> 02:02:18,257
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

1156
02:02:19,258 --> 02:02:22,094
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

1157
02:02:22,261 --> 02:02:26,056
- Impossible. The prophecy tells us...
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

1158
02:02:27,850 --> 02:02:30,352
The prophecy was a lie.

1159
02:02:31,604 --> 02:02:34,607
The One was never meant
to end anything.

1160
02:02:34,773 --> 02:02:37,776
It was all another system of control.

1161
02:02:37,985 --> 02:02:41,071
I don't believe that.

1162
02:02:41,405 --> 02:02:43,699
But you said it yourself.

1163
02:02:43,908 --> 02:02:47,870
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

1164
02:02:54,084 --> 02:02:56,504
I'm sorry.

1165
02:02:56,712 --> 02:03:00,049
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

1166
02:03:00,257 --> 02:03:03,427
...I swear to you it's the truth.

1167
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:09,308
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1168
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:12,728
Oh, no!

1169
02:03:22,112 --> 02:03:25,449
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

1170
02:03:25,950 --> 02:03:27,159
It's a bomb.

1171
02:03:28,369 --> 02:03:30,579
We have to get out of here. Now.

1172
02:04:07,283 --> 02:04:09,160
I have dreamed a dream...

1173
02:04:12,204 --> 02:04:15,541
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

1174
02:04:26,635 --> 02:04:28,846
Here they come.

1175
02:04:29,138 --> 02:04:30,848
Let's go, Morpheus.

1176
02:04:32,266 --> 02:04:35,269
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

1177
02:04:43,027 --> 02:04:46,030
- Come on!
- Something's different.

1178
02:04:46,197 --> 02:04:48,157
What?

1179
02:04:48,866 --> 02:04:50,326
I can feel them.

1180
02:05:13,307 --> 02:05:14,850
Neo!

1181
02:05:21,065 --> 02:05:24,610
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1182
02:05:29,907 --> 02:05:31,784
<i>It's the Hammer.</i>

1183
02:05:43,504 --> 02:05:46,173
He's in some kind of coma...

1184
02:05:46,382 --> 02:05:48,592
...but his vitals are stable.

1185
02:05:49,844 --> 02:05:51,720
What about you?

1186
02:05:51,929 --> 02:05:54,056
I'm fine.

1187
02:05:54,223 --> 02:05:56,559
You could use some rest.

1188
02:05:56,767 --> 02:05:58,561
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1189
02:06:05,693 --> 02:06:08,279
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

1190
02:06:08,487 --> 02:06:11,323
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1191
02:06:11,532 --> 02:06:14,285
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1192
02:06:14,535 --> 02:06:17,913
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

1193
02:06:18,289 --> 02:06:20,791
...until someone screwed it up.

1194
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,586
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

1195
02:06:23,794 --> 02:06:27,590
- Five ships were instantly downed.
- When the machines broke through...

1196
02:06:27,798 --> 02:06:30,968
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1197
02:06:31,177 --> 02:06:34,013
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1198
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:36,599
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

1199
02:06:36,807 --> 02:06:38,517
Who?

1200
02:06:38,726 --> 02:06:42,396
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1201
02:06:42,605 --> 02:06:44,857
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1202
02:06:45,107 --> 02:06:46,150
You found one?

1203
02:06:47,943 --> 02:06:49,653
Only one.

1204
02:16:42,746 --> 02:16:46,000
<i>Everything that has a beginning,,,</i>

1205
02:16:46,208 --> 02:16:47,918
<i>,,, has an end,</i>

1206
02:16:50,337 --> 02:16:53,174
<i>I see the end coming,</i>

1207
02:16:53,382 --> 02:16:55,593
<i>I see the darkness spreading,</i>

1208
02:16:55,801 --> 02:16:57,178
<i>I see death,</i>

1209
02:16:59,305 --> 02:17:02,308
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1210
02:17:02,475 --> 02:17:04,435
We missed you.

1211
02:17:04,643 --> 02:17:06,437
It ends tonight.

1212
02:17:13,694 --> 02:17:16,781
<i>And you are all that stands in his way,</i>

1213
02:17:18,407 --> 02:17:22,953
<i>If you cannot stop him tonight, then
I fear that tomorrow may never come,</i>
