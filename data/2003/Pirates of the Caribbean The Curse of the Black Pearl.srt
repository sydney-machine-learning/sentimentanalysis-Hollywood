1
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:33,719
<i>Drink up, me hearties, yo ho</i>

2
00:00:33,844 --> 00:00:38,349
<i>We kidnap and ravage</i>
<i>and don't give a hoot</i>

3
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:42,311
<i>Drink up, me hearties, yo ho</i>

4
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:45,397
<i>Yo ho, yo ho</i>

5
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:48,442
<i>A pirate's life for me</i>

6
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:54,406
<i>We extort, we pilfer</i>
<i>We filch, we sack...</i>

7
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:58,160
Quiet, missy!
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

8
00:00:58,494 --> 00:01:00,537
You don't want to bring
them down on us.

9
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:02,539
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

10
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:05,334
She was singing about pirates!

11
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,463
Bad luck to sing about pirates
with us mired in this unnatural fog.

12
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:12,925
- Mark my words.
- Consider them marked.

13
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:16,178
- On your way.
- Aye, Lieutenant.

14
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:21,225
Bad luck to have a woman on board,
too. Even a miniature one.

15
00:01:21,809 --> 00:01:24,270
It'd be exciting to meet a pirate.

16
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,901
Think again, Miss Swann.
Vile creatures, the lot of them.

17
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:35,364
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

18
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:37,449
gets what he deserves.

19
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:40,202
A short drop and a sudden stop.

20
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,583
I appreciate your fervor,

21
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,547
but I'm concerned about the effect this
subject will have upon my daughter.

22
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:53,382
My apologies, Governor Swann.

23
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:57,511
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- That's what concerns me.

24
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:28,334
There's a boy in the water!

25
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:32,630
Man overboard!

26
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:37,926
Man the ropes! Fetch a hook!
Haul him aboard!

27
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:48,395
He's still breathing.

28
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,731
Mary, Mother of God!

29
00:02:57,154 --> 00:02:59,823
What happened here?

30
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:04,078
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

31
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,293
Lot of good it did them.
Everyone's thinking it, I'm saying it.

32
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:13,212
Pirates!

33
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:17,341
There's no proof of that!
It was probably an accident.

34
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,722
Rouse the captain. Heave to
and take in sail. Launch the boats.

35
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:28,560
Elizabeth, accompany the boy.

36
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:31,230
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

37
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:32,773
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

38
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,588
It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann.

39
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:59,383
Will Turner.

40
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:02,386
I'm watching over you, Will.

41
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,234
You're a pirate!

42
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,111
Has he said anything?

43
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:23,198
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

44
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:25,200
Take him below.

45
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:36,397
Elizabeth!

46
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:40,276
Are you all right?

47
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:42,569
Are you decent?

48
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:43,821
Yes.

49
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:45,823
Yes?

50
00:05:46,282 --> 00:05:48,784
Still abed at this hour?

51
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:51,662
It's a beautiful day.

52
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:55,708
I have a gift for you.

53
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:01,255
- It's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

54
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,092
May I inquire as to the occasion?

55
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:09,013
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

56
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:11,515
Go on.

57
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,065
Actually... I had hoped you might
wear it for the ceremony today.

58
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,400
The ceremony?

59
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:24,194
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

60
00:06:24,278 --> 00:06:25,446
I knew it!

61
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:28,490
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

62
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:32,786
A fine gentleman, don't you think?
He fancies you, you know.

63
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:36,665
Elizabeth? How's it coming?

64
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:41,462
- It's difficult to say.
- It's the latest fashion in London.

65
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:45,299
Women in London
must've learned not to breathe!

66
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:48,469
My Lord, you have a visitor.

67
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:09,782
Mr. Turner! Good to see you again.

68
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:13,494
Good day, sir. I have your order.

69
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:25,381
The blade is folded steel. That's
gold filigree laid into the handle.

70
00:07:26,173 --> 00:07:27,967
If I may?

71
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:31,845
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the width of the blade.

72
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:34,098
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the width of the blade.

73
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:39,186
Impressive. Very impressive.

74
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:44,316
Commodore Norrington's
going to be very pleased with this.

75
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:47,569
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

76
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,407
I shall.

77
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,036
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

78
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,499
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning!

79
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,503
Will! It's so good to see you!

80
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:08,757
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?

81
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:12,803
- Elizabeth, is that proper?
- About the day we met. Remember?

82
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:14,972
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

83
00:08:15,097 --> 00:08:18,392
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

84
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:21,729
At least once more, Miss Swann.
As always.

85
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:25,566
There. See? At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

86
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:27,860
We really must be going.

87
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:31,447
Good day, Mr. Turner.

88
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:34,033
Come along!

89
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:38,120
Good day...

90
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,082
Elizabeth.

91
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:15,134
Hold up there, you!

92
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,555
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

93
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:24,018
I need to know your name.

94
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:30,524
What do you say to three shillings
and we forget the name?

95
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:35,738
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

96
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:13,275
Two paces... march!

97
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:17,863
Right about... face!

98
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:23,118
Present... arms!

99
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:48,811
This dock is off limits to civilians.

100
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,187
This dock is off limits to civilians.

101
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:52,523
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.

102
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,775
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.

103
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:02,032
There's some high-toned
and fancy to-do at the fort.

104
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:07,204
How could it be that two upstanding
gentlemen did not merit an invitation?

105
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:11,208
We have to make sure this dock
stays off limits to civilians.

106
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:17,256
It's a fine goal, to be sure,
but it seems to me, a ship like that

107
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:19,925
makes this one here
a bit superfluous.

108
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,095
The Dauntless is the power
in these waters,

109
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,099
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

110
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:31,020
I've heard of one. It's supposed
to be fast, nigh uncatchable.

111
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:33,272
The Black Pearl.

112
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:39,153
There's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor.

113
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:42,323
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

114
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:45,409
- No, it's not.
- It is. I've seen it!

115
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,329
- You've seen it?
- Yes.

116
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:51,498
- You haven't seen it!
- Yes, I have!

117
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:56,795
You've seen a ship with black sails,
that's crewed by the damned

118
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,092
and captained by a man so evil
that Hell itself spat him back out?

119
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:05,554
- No.
- No.

120
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,557
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

121
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:11,060
No ship not crewed by the damned

122
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:14,188
and captained by a man so evil,
Hell spat him back out,

123
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:18,651
could have black sails, so couldn't be
any other ship than The Black Pearl.

124
00:13:18,776 --> 00:13:21,278
Is that what you're saying?

125
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:22,488
No.

126
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:27,159
Like I said, there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

127
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:37,711
You! Get away from there!
You don't have permission to be aboard!

128
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:40,589
I'm sorry, but it's such a pretty
boat. Ship!

129
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:45,177
- What's your name?
- Smith! Or Smithy, if you like.

130
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:48,555
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
'Mr. Smith'?

131
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:52,226
- And no lies!
- All right. I confess.

132
00:13:53,143 --> 00:13:54,770
I intend to commandeer a ship,
pick up a crew in Tortuga,

133
00:13:54,812 --> 00:13:56,438
I intend to commandeer a ship,
pick up a crew in Tortuga,

134
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:59,400
rape, pillage and otherwise
pilfer my black guts out.

135
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:03,445
- I said no lies!
- I think he's telling the truth.

136
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,824
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

137
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:10,911
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth even if he told you.

138
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:23,007
May I have a moment?

139
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:34,226
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

140
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:41,525
I apologize if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

141
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:50,409
This promotion throws into sharp relief
that which I have not yet achieved.

142
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:55,164
A marriage to a fine woman.

143
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:58,876
You have become a fine woman.

144
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:01,462
I can't breathe!

145
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:04,340
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

146
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:09,428
Then they made me their chief.

147
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,515
Elizabeth?

148
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:17,478
Elizabeth!

149
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:21,982
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

150
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:26,946
- Will you be saving her?
- I can't swim!

151
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:32,660
Pride of the King's Navy, you are!
Do not lose these.

152
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:48,717
What was that?

153
00:16:31,427 --> 00:16:33,220
I got her!

154
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:36,181
- She's not breathing!
- Move!

155
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:46,817
- I never would've thought of that.
- You've never been to Singapore.

156
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:53,616
Where did you get that?

157
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:57,244
On your feet.

158
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:01,874
Elizabeth!

159
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:04,084
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

160
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:10,966
- Shoot him!
- Father!

161
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:14,970
Commodore, do you intend
to kill my rescuer?

162
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:22,937
I believe thanks are in order.

163
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:31,654
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, pirate?

164
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:34,323
Hang him!

165
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:38,285
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

166
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,580
Well, well. Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

167
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:44,959
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

168
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:48,045
I don't see your ship... 'Captain'.

169
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:50,547
I'm in the market, as it were.

170
00:17:50,673 --> 00:17:52,925
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

171
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:56,136
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his.

172
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:02,142
No additional shot nor powder.

173
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:05,854
A compass that doesn't point north.

174
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:14,154
I half expected it to be made from wood.

175
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:19,660
You are without doubt
the worst pirate I've ever heard of!

176
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:21,996
But you have heard of me.

177
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:26,166
Commodore, I must protest!

178
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,335
Carefully, Lieutenant.

179
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,629
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

180
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:34,633
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man for his wickedness!

181
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:37,469
- It seems enough to condemn him.
- Indeed.

182
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:40,431
Finally.

183
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:44,977
- Don't shoot!
- I knew you'd warm up to me.

184
00:18:45,102 --> 00:18:49,189
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please. And my hat.

185
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:51,191
Commodore.

186
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:57,114
- Elizabeth... it is Elizabeth?
- It's Miss Swann.

187
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:02,453
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

188
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:05,873
If you'll be very kind.

189
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,600
Easy on the goods, darling.

190
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:28,520
- You're despicable.
- Sticks and stones, love.

191
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:31,398
I saved your life, you saved mine.
We're square.

192
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:35,110
Gentlemen, my lady,

193
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:38,530
you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

194
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:41,075
Captain Jack Sparrow!

195
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:02,888
- Now will you shoot him?
- Open fire!

196
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:12,231
On his heels!

197
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,623
Take cover, man!

198
00:20:29,748 --> 00:20:34,461
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has
a dawn appointment with the gallows.

199
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:36,755
I would hate for him to miss it.

200
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,428
Search up the stairs!

201
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,180
Look lively, men!

202
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,525
Right where I left you.

203
00:22:26,573 --> 00:22:29,159
Not where I left you.

204
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:40,713
You're the one they're hunting.

205
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,132
The pirate!

206
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:46,343
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

207
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:49,221
I avoid familiarity with pirates.

208
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:54,810
It would be a shame to put a black
mark on your record. Excuse me.

209
00:22:58,772 --> 00:23:03,235
Do you think this wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?

210
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:06,822
You threatened Miss Swann.

211
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:10,784
Only a little.

212
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:29,637
You know what you're doing.
Excellent form. How's your footwork?

213
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:31,847
If I step here...

214
00:23:33,182 --> 00:23:34,558
Good.

215
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:36,727
And now I step again.

216
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:43,567
Ta.

217
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:04,922
That is a wonderful trick.

218
00:24:05,756 --> 00:24:09,259
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

219
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:12,388
And now...
you have no weapon.

220
00:24:34,785 --> 00:24:36,370
Who makes all these?

221
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:39,164
I do.

222
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:43,127
And I practice with them
three hours a day.

223
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:47,131
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

224
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:58,726
Or, the reason you practice three hours
a day is that you already found one

225
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:02,438
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

226
00:25:02,563 --> 00:25:05,024
You're not a eunuch, are you?

227
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:09,486
I practice three hours a day
so when I meet a pirate, I can kill him!

228
00:26:26,772 --> 00:26:29,024
- You cheated!
- Pirate.

229
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:34,613
- Move away!
- No.

230
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:36,073
Please?

231
00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:39,952
No! I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

232
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:44,540
This shot is not meant for you.

233
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:56,885
There he is! Over here!

234
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:04,810
Excellent work, Mr. Brown. You've
assisted in the capture of a fugitive.

235
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:07,187
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

236
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:14,236
I trust you will remember this as the
day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

237
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:15,863
Take him away.

238
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,415
- Come here, boy. Come here.
- Who wants a juicy bone?

239
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,792
Come here, boy!

240
00:27:29,627 --> 00:27:33,797
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.

241
00:27:33,922 --> 00:27:38,010
Excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet.

242
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:49,104
There you go, miss. It was
a difficult day for you, I'm sure.

243
00:27:49,229 --> 00:27:54,360
I suspected Commodore Norrington would
propose, but I wasn't prepared for it.

244
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:58,614
I meant you being threatened
by that pirate! Sounds terrifying!

245
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:01,992
Yes, it was terrifying.

246
00:28:02,117 --> 00:28:05,287
But... the Commodore proposed!
Fancy that.

247
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:09,166
That's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

248
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:10,668
It is a smart match.

249
00:28:11,835 --> 00:28:13,587
He's a fine man.

250
00:28:14,713 --> 00:28:18,342
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

251
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:22,805
That Will Turner...
he's a fine man, too.

252
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,682
That is too bold.

253
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:28,560
Beggin' your pardon.
It was not my place.

254
00:29:17,443 --> 00:29:20,404
Has my daughter
given you an answer yet?

255
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:22,114
No, she hasn't.

256
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:24,533
She has had a trying day.

257
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:30,331
- Ghastly weather, don't you think?
- Really bleak.

258
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,792
What's that?

259
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:36,086
Cannon fire!

260
00:29:37,504 --> 00:29:39,340
Return fire!

261
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:41,759
I know those guns.

262
00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:49,475
It's the Pearl.

263
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,560
The Black Pearl?

264
00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:55,314
I've heard stories.

265
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:59,401
She's been preying on ships
and settlements for ten years.

266
00:29:59,526 --> 00:30:02,571
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?

267
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:06,450
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

268
00:30:30,224 --> 00:30:31,642
Mama!

269
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:41,003
- Sight the muzzle flash.
- Aim for the flashes!

270
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:45,466
I need a full spread, fore and aft.
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges.

271
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:49,678
Governor. Barricade yourself
in my office.

272
00:31:50,971 --> 00:31:53,140
That's an order.

273
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:12,242
Don't!

274
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:14,703
Hello, chum.

275
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:19,625
Up there!

276
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:32,137
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you.

277
00:32:32,221 --> 00:32:34,807
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

278
00:32:34,932 --> 00:32:36,809
In here!

279
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:41,897
They haven't seen you.
First chance you get, run to the fort.

280
00:32:50,864 --> 00:32:52,533
Gotcha!

281
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,041
No! It's hot. I'm burning!

282
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,209
Come on!

283
00:33:06,672 --> 00:33:08,841
Come on, me men.

284
00:33:45,628 --> 00:33:49,298
We know you're here, poppet.

285
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,052
- Poppet!
- Come out.

286
00:33:53,302 --> 00:33:55,721
We promise we won't hurt you.

287
00:33:57,931 --> 00:34:00,476
We will find you, poppet.

288
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,272
You've got something of ours
and it calls to us.

289
00:34:11,028 --> 00:34:13,447
The gold calls to us.

290
00:34:14,573 --> 00:34:16,909
The gold.

291
00:34:21,872 --> 00:34:23,916
Hello, poppet.

292
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,669
Parley.

293
00:34:26,794 --> 00:34:30,130
- What?
- I invoke the right of parley.

294
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:35,594
The Code of the Brethren states
you have to take me to your captain.

295
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,346
I know the Code.

296
00:34:37,471 --> 00:34:41,308
You can do me no harm
until the parley is complete.

297
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:46,021
- To blazes with the Code.
- She wants to be taken to the Captain.

298
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:48,774
And she'll go, without a fuss.

299
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,903
We must honor the Code.

300
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:05,541
Say goodbye!

301
00:35:09,503 --> 00:35:10,879
Goodbye.

302
00:35:15,175 --> 00:35:17,636
- Come on.
- Elizabeth.

303
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:28,439
Out of my way, scum!

304
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:43,454
My sympathies. You've no manner
of luck at all.

305
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:09,146
Come on, doggy! It's just
you and me now.

306
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:15,611
It's you and old Jack. Come on.
That's a boy! Get your bone!

307
00:36:15,736 --> 00:36:19,281
That's a good boy.
A bit closer!

308
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,700
That's it, doggy!

309
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:25,120
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy character!

310
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:29,833
No! I didn't mean it!

311
00:36:36,757 --> 00:36:38,926
This ain't the armory!

312
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:46,266
Well, well, well. Look what we have
here, Twigg. Captain Jack Sparrow!

313
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:49,603
Last time I saw you,

314
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:56,318
you were all alone on a godforsaken
island, shrinking into the distance.

315
00:36:56,652 --> 00:36:59,154
His fortunes aren't improved much.

316
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,658
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

317
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:07,413
The deepest circle of Hell is reserved
for betrayers and mutineers.

318
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,711
So there is a curse.

319
00:37:15,254 --> 00:37:19,091
- That's interesting.
- You know nothing of Hell.

320
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:29,310
That's very interesting.

321
00:38:04,553 --> 00:38:07,056
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

322
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:10,434
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

323
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,146
- I am here to...
- You will speak when spoken to.

324
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:20,194
And ye will not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parley.

325
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:22,196
Aye, sir.

326
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,117
My apologies, miss.

327
00:38:27,242 --> 00:38:32,998
Captain Barbossa... I am here to
negotiate the cessation of hostilities.

328
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:38,462
There are a lot of long words there.
We're naught but humble pirates.

329
00:38:39,254 --> 00:38:43,384
- What is it you want?
- Leave and never come back.

330
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:49,556
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

331
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:52,142
Means "no."

332
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,813
Very well.

333
00:38:57,231 --> 00:38:59,233
I'll drop it.

334
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:07,950
Me holds are burstin' with swag.
That bit of shine matters to us?

335
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:10,077
Why?

336
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:14,081
It's what you've been searching for.
I recognize the ship.

337
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:17,084
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

338
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:19,253
Did you now?

339
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:27,052
Fine. I suppose if it is worthless
there's no point in me keeping it.

340
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:28,846
No!

341
00:39:39,148 --> 00:39:41,191
You have a name, missy?

342
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:47,990
Elizabeth... Turner. I'm a maid
in the Governor's household.

343
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:53,287
Miss Turner!

344
00:39:53,996 --> 00:39:56,665
- Turner!
- Bootstrap!

345
00:40:00,711 --> 00:40:05,883
How does a maid come to own
that trinket? Family heirloom?

346
00:40:06,842 --> 00:40:09,845
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

347
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:14,350
You hand it over
and we'll leave and never return.

348
00:40:28,364 --> 00:40:30,324
Our bargain?

349
00:40:32,368 --> 00:40:37,331
Still the guns and stow them. Signal
the men and make good to clear port.

350
00:40:37,456 --> 00:40:40,250
You have to take me to shore.
According to the Code...

351
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:42,002
First...

352
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:46,256
Your return to shore was not part of
our negotiations so I must do nothing.

353
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:50,511
Secondly, you must be a pirate for the
Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not.

354
00:40:50,636 --> 00:40:55,975
Thirdly, the code is more what
you'd call guidelines than actual rules.

355
00:40:56,058 --> 00:40:59,561
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

356
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:22,751
They've taken Elizabeth!

357
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:25,671
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

358
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:28,757
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

359
00:41:28,882 --> 00:41:31,385
Where do you propose we start?

360
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:36,015
If you have any information
concerning my daughter, share it.

361
00:41:37,474 --> 00:41:41,353
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.

362
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:44,440
Mentioned it is more what he did.

363
00:41:45,232 --> 00:41:47,985
Ask him where it is!
He could lead us to it.

364
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,778
No.

365
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:55,784
The pirates left Sparrow in his cell,
ergo they are not his allies.

366
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:59,246
We will establish their
most likely course...

367
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:01,707
That's not good enough!

368
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:09,006
Mr. Turner, you are not a military man
or a sailor. You are a blacksmith.

369
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:13,052
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

370
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,059
Do not think you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

371
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,315
Please.

372
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:33,238
- You! Sparrow!
- Aye?

373
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:36,283
You are familiar with
the Black Pearl?

374
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,786
- I've heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?

375
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:43,040
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?

376
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:51,173
Captain Barbossa and his crew of
miscreants sail from the Isla de Muerta.

377
00:42:51,298 --> 00:42:57,262
It's an island that cannot be found,
except by those who know where it is.

378
00:42:57,346 --> 00:43:02,559
The ship's real, therefore its anchorage
must be a real place. Where?

379
00:43:03,602 --> 00:43:06,855
- Why ask me?
- Because you're a pirate.

380
00:43:07,106 --> 00:43:10,609
You want to turn pirate yourself.
Is that it?

381
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,070
Never!

382
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:19,201
- They took Miss Swann.
- So it is that you found a girl!

383
00:43:19,451 --> 00:43:21,161
I see!

384
00:43:21,287 --> 00:43:24,373
If you intend to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

385
00:43:24,456 --> 00:43:28,794
and so, win fair lady's heart,
you'll have to do it alone, mate.

386
00:43:28,877 --> 00:43:31,880
I see no profit in it for me.

387
00:43:32,006 --> 00:43:34,800
- I can get you out of here.
- The key's run off.

388
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:39,471
I helped build these cells.
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

389
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:46,437
With leverage and the proper application
of strength, the door will lift free.

390
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:52,234
- What's your name?
- Will Turner.

391
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:57,114
That would be short for William,
I imagine. Good, strong name.

392
00:43:58,157 --> 00:44:01,118
No doubt named for your father.

393
00:44:01,952 --> 00:44:03,871
Yes.

394
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:08,917
Mr. Turner, I've changed me mind.

395
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:12,004
If you spring me from here,
I swear, on pain of death,

396
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:16,008
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,
and your bonny lass.

397
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:18,677
Do we have an accord?

398
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:24,642
- Agreed.
- Agreed! Get me out!

399
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:31,690
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

400
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,407
We're going to steal a ship?

401
00:44:41,742 --> 00:44:44,411
- That ship?
- Commandeer.

402
00:44:44,536 --> 00:44:47,957
We're going to "commandeer" that ship.
Nautical term.

403
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:52,544
One question about your business,
or there's no use going.

404
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:56,507
This girl, how far are you willing to go
to save her?

405
00:44:56,632 --> 00:45:01,345
- I'd die for her.
- Good. No worries then.

406
00:45:20,406 --> 00:45:22,866
This is either madness or brilliance.

407
00:45:23,742 --> 00:45:27,329
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

408
00:45:57,067 --> 00:46:00,863
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

409
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:02,990
Aye! Avast!

410
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:10,873
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.
You'll never make it out of the bay.

411
00:46:11,957 --> 00:46:16,003
Son... I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

412
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:18,088
Savvy?

413
00:46:21,634 --> 00:46:24,887
- Commodore!
- They're taking the Dauntless!

414
00:46:26,972 --> 00:46:30,434
Commodore! They've taken the ship!

415
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:33,812
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

416
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:36,941
Rash, Turner. Too rash.

417
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:42,738
That is, without doubt, the worst pirate
I have ever seen.

418
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:48,243
Here they come.

419
00:46:52,164 --> 00:46:54,416
Bring her around!

420
00:47:01,048 --> 00:47:03,968
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

421
00:47:20,276 --> 00:47:22,861
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!

422
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:32,830
Thank you, Commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

423
00:47:32,955 --> 00:47:35,541
We'd have had
a hard time by ourselves.

424
00:47:38,794 --> 00:47:41,088
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

425
00:47:41,213 --> 00:47:43,549
With this wind we won't catch them.

426
00:47:43,674 --> 00:47:46,802
I don't need to. Get them in range
of the long nines.

427
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:50,014
Run out the guns!

428
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:52,683
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

429
00:47:52,808 --> 00:47:57,771
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

430
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,358
Commodore!
He's disabled the rudder chain.

431
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,072
Abandon ship!

432
00:48:13,454 --> 00:48:16,749
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

433
00:48:17,124 --> 00:48:19,543
So it would seem.

434
00:48:28,302 --> 00:48:32,097
When I was a lad living in England,
my mother raised me by herself.

435
00:48:32,222 --> 00:48:36,101
After she died, I came here,
looking for my father.

436
00:48:37,603 --> 00:48:39,605
Is that so?

437
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:43,484
My father, Bill Turner?

438
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:46,570
It was only after you learned my name
you agreed to help.

439
00:48:46,695 --> 00:48:49,448
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

440
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:53,035
I'm not a simpleton.
You knew my father.

441
00:48:59,249 --> 00:49:03,629
I knew him. Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

442
00:49:03,754 --> 00:49:06,840
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap".

443
00:49:06,966 --> 00:49:08,842
Bootstrap?

444
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:13,389
Good man. Good pirate.
I swear, you look just like him.

445
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:18,686
It's not true. He was a merchant sailor.
A respectable man who obeyed the law.

446
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:21,981
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

447
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:25,192
My father was not a pirate!

448
00:49:26,402 --> 00:49:30,197
Put it away, son.
It's not worth you getting beat again.

449
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:34,785
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

450
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:37,871
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

451
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,424
As long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

452
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:51,302
The only rules that matter are these:

453
00:49:51,427 --> 00:49:54,847
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

454
00:49:55,597 --> 00:50:01,061
You can accept your father was a
pirate and a good man, or you can't.

455
00:50:01,186 --> 00:50:05,482
Pirate is in your blood, so you'll
have to square with that someday.

456
00:50:05,608 --> 00:50:08,110
Me, for example,
I can let you drown,

457
00:50:08,235 --> 00:50:12,698
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies, savvy?

458
00:50:12,948 --> 00:50:14,575
So.

459
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:21,957
Can you sail under the command
of a pirate?

460
00:50:23,292 --> 00:50:25,252
Or can you not?

461
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:29,006
Tortuga?

462
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:30,549
Tortuga.

463
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:56,450
It is a sad life
that has never breathed deep

464
00:50:56,533 --> 00:50:59,954
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

465
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:03,540
What do you think?

466
00:51:07,127 --> 00:51:09,797
- It'll linger.
- I'll tell you, mate,

467
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:15,761
if every town were like this one,
no man would ever feel unwanted.

468
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:18,722
Scarlett!

469
00:51:19,848 --> 00:51:20,891
Not sure I deserved that.

470
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:21,976
Not sure I deserved that.

471
00:51:22,935 --> 00:51:23,560
Giselle.

472
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:24,186
Giselle.

473
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:25,980
- Who was she?
- What?

474
00:51:27,856 --> 00:51:29,650
I may have deserved that.

475
00:51:32,111 --> 00:51:35,072
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

476
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,660
Mother's love!

477
00:51:39,785 --> 00:51:41,453
Jack!

478
00:51:41,787 --> 00:51:44,873
You should know not to wake a man
when he's sleepin'.

479
00:51:44,999 --> 00:51:48,836
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

480
00:51:48,961 --> 00:51:52,089
The man who did the waking
buys the man who was sleeping a drink.

481
00:51:52,464 --> 00:51:57,303
The man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to his proposition.

482
00:51:59,638 --> 00:52:02,433
Aye, that'll about do it.

483
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,439
Blast! I'm already awake!

484
00:52:08,814 --> 00:52:10,941
That was for the smell.

485
00:52:20,701 --> 00:52:22,661
Keep a sharp eye.

486
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:31,462
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

487
00:52:31,503 --> 00:52:33,130
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

488
00:52:34,423 --> 00:52:36,550
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

489
00:52:40,346 --> 00:52:43,641
I know where it's going to be,
and I'm gonna take it.

490
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,062
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

491
00:52:48,187 --> 00:52:51,440
You know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

492
00:52:51,565 --> 00:52:54,568
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

493
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:56,904
All I need is a crew.

494
00:52:57,029 --> 00:53:01,867
Captain Barbossa is not a man to suffer
fools nor strike a bargain with one.

495
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:04,203
It's a good thing I'm not a fool, then.

496
00:53:04,328 --> 00:53:09,333
Prove me wrong. What makes you think
Barbossa will give up his ship to you?

497
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:12,753
Let's just say it's a matter
of leverage.

498
00:53:29,061 --> 00:53:31,021
The kid?

499
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:34,608
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

500
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:38,153
His only child. Savvy?

501
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:40,823
Is he now?

502
00:53:43,158 --> 00:53:45,494
Leverage, says you.

503
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:48,622
I feel a change in the wind, says I.

504
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:52,918
I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be
some sailors on this rock crazy as you.

505
00:53:53,127 --> 00:53:55,379
One can only hope.

506
00:53:55,504 --> 00:53:56,880
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

507
00:53:56,922 --> 00:53:58,257
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

508
00:54:23,032 --> 00:54:27,244
You'll be dining with the captain,
and he requests you wear this.

509
00:54:28,287 --> 00:54:31,790
Tell him that I am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.

510
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:35,169
He said you'd say that.

511
00:54:35,294 --> 00:54:39,715
He also said if that be the case,
you'll be dining with the crew.

512
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,801
And you'll be naked.

513
00:54:47,848 --> 00:54:48,932
Fine.

514
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:09,244
There's no need to stand on ceremony,
no call to impress anyone.

515
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:12,790
You must be hungry.

516
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:31,100
Try the wine.

517
00:55:35,229 --> 00:55:38,190
And the apples. One of those next.

518
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,993
It's poisoned.

519
00:55:49,702 --> 00:55:51,870
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

520
00:55:52,121 --> 00:55:56,083
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

521
00:55:59,586 --> 00:56:03,132
You don't know what this is, do you?

522
00:56:03,257 --> 00:56:05,217
It's a pirate medallion.

523
00:56:05,509 --> 00:56:08,387
This is Aztec gold.

524
00:56:08,512 --> 00:56:14,476
One of 882 identical pieces they
delivered in a stone chest to Cortés.

525
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,397
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

526
00:56:18,439 --> 00:56:20,774
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

527
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:23,902
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

528
00:56:24,236 --> 00:56:27,656
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

529
00:56:29,575 --> 00:56:32,077
a terrible curse.

530
00:56:32,828 --> 00:56:38,000
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

531
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,793
shall be punished for eternity.

532
00:56:39,835 --> 00:56:41,462
Shall be punished for eternity.

533
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,300
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

534
00:56:46,425 --> 00:56:47,509
Aye.

535
00:56:48,427 --> 00:56:51,847
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

536
00:56:51,972 --> 00:56:54,933
Buried on an island of the dead
what cannot be found,

537
00:56:55,059 --> 00:56:57,645
except for those who know where it is.

538
00:56:58,479 --> 00:57:00,481
Find it, we did.

539
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:05,611
There be the chest.
Inside be the gold.

540
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:07,821
And we took 'em all!

541
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:10,199
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

542
00:57:10,324 --> 00:57:14,411
and frittered 'em away on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

543
00:57:14,828 --> 00:57:20,000
The more we gave 'em away,
the more we came to realize...

544
00:57:20,876 --> 00:57:24,171
the drink would not satisfy.

545
00:57:24,296 --> 00:57:26,090
Food turned to ash in our mouths,

546
00:57:26,131 --> 00:57:27,925
Food turned to ash in our mouths,

547
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:32,680
and all the pleasurable company
in the world could not slake our lust.

548
00:57:34,306 --> 00:57:37,601
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

549
00:57:38,811 --> 00:57:41,981
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

550
00:57:42,106 --> 00:57:44,525
we are consumed by it.

551
00:57:55,744 --> 00:57:59,999
There is one way we can end our curse.

552
00:58:02,835 --> 00:58:07,423
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold must be restored,

553
00:58:07,548 --> 00:58:09,508
and the blood repaid.

554
00:58:12,511 --> 00:58:16,098
Thanks to ye, we have the final piece.

555
00:58:18,142 --> 00:58:20,311
And the blood to be repaid?

556
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:23,981
That's why there's no sense
to be killing you.

557
00:58:24,106 --> 00:58:26,025
Yet.

558
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,361
Apple?

559
00:58:45,252 --> 00:58:49,214
I'm curious. After killing me,
what are you planning on doing next?

560
00:59:53,696 --> 00:59:54,905
Look!

561
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:58,158
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

562
00:59:58,993 --> 01:00:00,577
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

563
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:02,162
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

564
01:00:02,288 --> 01:00:04,081
But neither are we dead.

565
01:00:05,249 --> 01:00:09,003
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

566
01:00:09,128 --> 01:00:11,588
Too long I've been starvin' to death
and haven't died.

567
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:14,091
Too long I've been starvin' to death
and haven't died.

568
01:00:14,216 --> 01:00:16,302
I feel nothing.

569
01:00:16,427 --> 01:00:19,305
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

570
01:00:20,764 --> 01:00:23,225
nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

571
01:00:23,976 --> 01:00:28,397
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

572
01:00:28,522 --> 01:00:30,399
You're in one!

573
01:00:48,334 --> 01:00:50,669
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

574
01:00:50,794 --> 01:00:53,797
You heard the captain.
Back to work.

575
01:00:59,553 --> 01:01:04,224
Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

576
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:07,394
Every man worth his salt,

577
01:01:07,645 --> 01:01:09,480
and crazy to boot.

578
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:12,566
So this is your able-bodied crew?

579
01:01:18,906 --> 01:01:20,824
- You, sailor!
- Cotton, sir.

580
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:24,411
Mr. Cotton, do you have the courage
and fortitude to follow orders

581
01:01:24,536 --> 01:01:27,539
and stay true in the face of danger
and almost certain death?

582
01:01:28,082 --> 01:01:32,127
- Mr. Cotton. Answer, man!
- He's a mute, sir.

583
01:01:32,252 --> 01:01:36,465
Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so
he trained the parrot to talk for him.

584
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,592
No one's yet figured how.

585
01:01:41,303 --> 01:01:45,224
Mr. Cotton's parrot,
same question.

586
01:01:45,474 --> 01:01:48,811
Wind in your sails!
Wind in your sails!

587
01:01:49,353 --> 01:01:51,730
Mostly, we figure that means "yes".

588
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:54,066
Of course it does. Satisfied?

589
01:01:55,067 --> 01:01:57,027
Well, you've proved they're mad.

590
01:01:57,152 --> 01:01:59,488
What's the benefit for us?

591
01:02:09,581 --> 01:02:10,624
Anamaria!

592
01:02:13,127 --> 01:02:16,964
- I suppose you didn't deserve that.
- No, that one I deserved.

593
01:02:17,089 --> 01:02:19,925
- You stole my boat!
- Actually...

594
01:02:22,052 --> 01:02:27,099
Borrowed without permission, but with
every intention of bringing it back.

595
01:02:27,224 --> 01:02:29,977
- But you didn't!
- You'll get another one.

596
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:33,731
- I will.
- A better one.

597
01:02:33,856 --> 01:02:35,649
A better one!

598
01:02:35,774 --> 01:02:38,027
- That one.
- What one?

599
01:02:39,903 --> 01:02:41,530
That one?

600
01:02:44,617 --> 01:02:46,285
Aye. That one.

601
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:47,911
- What say you?
- Aye!

602
01:02:48,037 --> 01:02:49,371
Aye!

603
01:02:49,496 --> 01:02:51,457
Anchor's aweigh!

604
01:02:51,582 --> 01:02:55,669
No, it's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

605
01:02:55,794 --> 01:02:58,047
It'll be far worse not to have her.

606
01:03:31,914 --> 01:03:35,250
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

607
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:37,544
with a compass that doesn't work?

608
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:42,383
The compass doesn't point north, but
we're not trying to find north, are we?

609
01:03:53,102 --> 01:03:55,479
We should drop canvas, sir.

610
01:03:55,604 --> 01:03:57,606
She can hold a bit longer.

611
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,445
What's in your head as puts you
in such a fine mood, Cap'n?

612
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:05,197
We're catching up.

613
01:04:20,296 --> 01:04:22,298
Time to go, poppet.

614
01:05:17,978 --> 01:05:22,358
Dead men tell no tales.

615
01:05:24,944 --> 01:05:29,490
Chills the bones, how many honest
sailors been claimed by this passage.

616
01:05:44,964 --> 01:05:47,299
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

617
01:05:47,424 --> 01:05:50,469
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
before he came to Tortuga

618
01:05:50,594 --> 01:05:53,263
with a mind to find the treasure
of the Isla de Muerta.

619
01:05:53,472 --> 01:05:56,767
That was before I'd met him, when he
was captain of the Black Pearl.

620
01:05:57,685 --> 01:05:58,686
What?

621
01:06:02,606 --> 01:06:06,360
- He failed to mention that.
- He plays things close to the vest now.

622
01:06:06,485 --> 01:06:08,654
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

623
01:06:08,779 --> 01:06:13,242
Three days into the trip, the first mate
says, "Everything's an equal share."

624
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:18,080
"The location of the treasure, too."
So Jack gives up the bearings.

625
01:06:18,205 --> 01:06:21,458
That night, there was a mutiny.

626
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:24,628
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

627
01:06:24,753 --> 01:06:28,048
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

628
01:06:31,093 --> 01:06:33,220
So that's the reason for all the...

629
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:38,058
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

630
01:06:38,183 --> 01:06:43,606
When a pirate's marooned, he's given
a pistol with a single shot. One shot.

631
01:06:43,731 --> 01:06:46,567
That won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

632
01:06:46,692 --> 01:06:50,321
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

633
01:06:50,446 --> 01:06:53,407
that pistol looks real friendly.

634
01:06:53,532 --> 01:06:56,785
But Jack escaped the island,
and still has that single shot.

635
01:06:56,910 --> 01:07:00,414
He won't use it, though,
save on one man.

636
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:02,541
His mutinous first mate.

637
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:04,627
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

638
01:07:05,919 --> 01:07:09,214
- How did Jack get off the island?
- I'll tell ye.

639
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:13,636
He waded out into the shallows,
and waited three days and three nights,

640
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:18,474
till all manner of sea creatures
became acclimated to his presence.

641
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:22,394
On the fourth morning,
he roped a couple of sea turtles,

642
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:24,855
lashed them together
and made a raft.

643
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:30,361
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

644
01:07:32,655 --> 01:07:34,949
What did he use for rope?

645
01:07:40,245 --> 01:07:42,456
Human hair.

646
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:45,042
From my back.

647
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:48,587
- Let go the anchor!
- Lower the anchor line!

648
01:07:48,712 --> 01:07:49,922
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

649
01:07:49,964 --> 01:07:51,131
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

650
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:52,841
Captain.

651
01:07:52,967 --> 01:07:55,469
What if the worst should happen?

652
01:07:55,594 --> 01:07:58,847
- Keep to the Code.
- Aye. The Code.

653
01:08:25,249 --> 01:08:29,753
- Ten years of hoarding swag.
- Now we finally get to spend it.

654
01:08:36,927 --> 01:08:39,680
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

655
01:08:40,472 --> 01:08:44,101
and you can buy an eye
that fits and is made of glass.

656
01:08:44,226 --> 01:08:47,146
This one does splinter
something terrible.

657
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:50,190
Stop rubbing it.

658
01:09:09,168 --> 01:09:12,129
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

659
01:09:12,254 --> 01:09:14,506
Pirates' Code.

660
01:09:14,632 --> 01:09:18,427
Any man who falls behind
is left behind.

661
01:09:19,762 --> 01:09:22,056
No heroes amongst thieves.

662
01:09:23,474 --> 01:09:25,684
For having such a bleak outlook
on pirates

663
01:09:25,893 --> 01:09:28,228
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

664
01:09:29,313 --> 01:09:32,149
Sprung a man from jail,

665
01:09:32,274 --> 01:09:34,652
commandeered a ship of the fleet,

666
01:09:34,777 --> 01:09:37,446
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

667
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:42,534
and you're completely obsessed
with treasure.

668
01:09:45,537 --> 01:09:49,083
That's not true. I am not obsessed
with treasure.

669
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:59,009
Not all treasure is silver
and gold, mate.

670
01:09:59,134 --> 01:10:02,179
Gentlemen, the time has come!

671
01:10:02,304 --> 01:10:04,848
Salvation is nigh!

672
01:10:06,016 --> 01:10:09,436
- Our torment is nearing an end!
- Elizabeth.

673
01:10:09,937 --> 01:10:12,064
For ten years
we've been tested and tried

674
01:10:12,189 --> 01:10:17,403
and each man here has proved his mettle
a hundred times over

675
01:10:17,528 --> 01:10:19,822
and a hundred times again!

676
01:10:21,615 --> 01:10:24,118
Suffered, I have!

677
01:10:24,243 --> 01:10:30,749
Punished we were, the lot of us,
disproportionate to our crime!

678
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:34,378
Here it is!

679
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,218
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

680
01:10:43,262 --> 01:10:47,558
Every last piece that went astray,
we have returned.

681
01:10:48,434 --> 01:10:49,935
Save for this!

682
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,896
- Jack!
- Not yet.

683
01:10:53,647 --> 01:10:55,858
We wait for the opportune moment.

684
01:10:59,069 --> 01:11:03,657
When's that? When it's of greatest
profit to you?

685
01:11:03,782 --> 01:11:06,368
May I ask you something?

686
01:11:06,493 --> 01:11:08,954
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

687
01:11:10,205 --> 01:11:15,419
Do us a favor. I know it's difficult
for you, but please stay here.

688
01:11:15,502 --> 01:11:17,838
And try not to do anything stupid.

689
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:25,012
Who among us has paid the blood
sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

690
01:11:25,137 --> 01:11:28,807
- Us!
- And whose blood must yet be paid?

691
01:11:28,932 --> 01:11:30,559
Hers!

692
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:37,358
You know the first thing I'm going to do
after the curse is lifted?

693
01:11:39,735 --> 01:11:43,030
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

694
01:11:50,913 --> 01:11:52,873
Begun by blood.

695
01:11:52,998 --> 01:11:54,959
By blood undone.

696
01:11:59,254 --> 01:12:02,967
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not going to be your leverage.

697
01:12:12,226 --> 01:12:14,603
That's it?

698
01:12:14,728 --> 01:12:16,188
Waste not.

699
01:12:54,184 --> 01:12:55,394
Did it work?

700
01:12:55,519 --> 01:12:58,397
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

701
01:13:05,529 --> 01:13:08,032
You're not dead!

702
01:13:08,115 --> 01:13:09,658
No.

703
01:13:11,243 --> 01:13:13,579
- He shot me.
- It didn't work.

704
01:13:13,704 --> 01:13:16,206
The curse is still upon us!

705
01:13:20,753 --> 01:13:23,172
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

706
01:13:23,255 --> 01:13:25,507
Was your father William Turner?

707
01:13:26,258 --> 01:13:27,301
No.

708
01:13:27,426 --> 01:13:30,721
Where's his child who sailed
from England eight years ago?

709
01:13:30,846 --> 01:13:34,433
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner? Where?

710
01:13:41,482 --> 01:13:45,861
You two!
You brought us the wrong person!

711
01:13:47,154 --> 01:13:48,489
No!

712
01:13:48,614 --> 01:13:51,408
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

713
01:13:51,533 --> 01:13:54,620
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her.

714
01:13:55,913 --> 01:13:58,248
I think she lied to us.

715
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:02,002
You brought us here for nothing.

716
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:06,173
I won't take questioning,
not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.

717
01:14:06,298 --> 01:14:10,511
Who's to blame him? Your decisions
have led us from bad to worse!

718
01:14:12,763 --> 01:14:15,307
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths!

719
01:14:19,311 --> 01:14:21,814
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place!

720
01:14:23,732 --> 01:14:27,736
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

721
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:33,200
I say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood. Just in case.

722
01:14:33,325 --> 01:14:34,743
Yeah!

723
01:14:43,419 --> 01:14:46,338
The medallion! She's taken it!

724
01:14:46,547 --> 01:14:50,217
Get after her, you feckless pack
of ingrates!

725
01:14:56,223 --> 01:14:58,892
- Where are the oars?
- There's no oars!

726
01:14:59,018 --> 01:15:01,895
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

727
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:12,489
You!

728
01:15:14,074 --> 01:15:17,036
- You're supposed to be dead.
- Am I not?

729
01:15:27,338 --> 01:15:29,298
Pearlie...

730
01:15:29,965 --> 01:15:32,217
Palu-li-la-la-lulu...

731
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,764
Parlili...

732
01:15:36,889 --> 01:15:39,391
Parsnip... Parsley...

733
01:15:39,516 --> 01:15:41,727
Partner...

734
01:15:41,852 --> 01:15:44,355
- Parley?
- That's the one! Parley!

735
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,065
Parley!

736
01:15:46,148 --> 01:15:48,067
Parley?

737
01:15:48,692 --> 01:15:52,529
Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead
thought of parley!

738
01:15:53,906 --> 01:15:55,908
That would be the French.

739
01:16:08,337 --> 01:16:11,215
- Not more pirates.
- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

740
01:16:12,633 --> 01:16:13,676
Mr. Gibbs?

741
01:16:14,551 --> 01:16:16,804
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

742
01:16:16,887 --> 01:16:19,390
Jack Sparrow?

743
01:16:21,225 --> 01:16:23,185
He fell behind.

744
01:16:29,775 --> 01:16:32,444
Keep to the Code.

745
01:16:32,528 --> 01:16:35,322
Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails!

746
01:16:35,447 --> 01:16:37,408
Split-quick, you dibbies!

747
01:16:43,289 --> 01:16:46,208
How the blazes did you get
off that island?

748
01:16:47,793 --> 01:16:51,171
When you marooned me
on that godforsaken spit of land,

749
01:16:51,255 --> 01:16:53,632
you forgot one very important thing.

750
01:16:55,592 --> 01:16:57,553
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

751
01:16:58,178 --> 01:17:02,433
Well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

752
01:17:03,475 --> 01:17:06,937
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

753
01:17:07,062 --> 01:17:08,689
Aye.

754
01:17:08,814 --> 01:17:10,858
Kill him.

755
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:14,403
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

756
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,282
Hold your fire!

757
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:26,624
You know whose blood we need.

758
01:17:28,334 --> 01:17:31,045
I know whose blood you need.

759
01:17:37,384 --> 01:17:39,928
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

760
01:17:40,054 --> 01:17:42,014
A pirate.

761
01:17:42,473 --> 01:17:45,559
Here. Let me.

762
01:17:45,684 --> 01:17:47,645
Thank you.

763
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,982
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

764
01:17:53,275 --> 01:17:55,235
Why?

765
01:17:57,363 --> 01:17:59,323
I don't know.

766
01:17:59,823 --> 01:18:02,826
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

767
01:18:02,952 --> 01:18:07,456
- They're rough.
- No. I mean, yes, they are, but...

768
01:18:10,834 --> 01:18:12,878
Don't stop.

769
01:18:20,302 --> 01:18:21,679
Elizabeth.

770
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:39,613
It's yours.

771
01:18:43,367 --> 01:18:46,745
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

772
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:50,291
It was a gift from my father.
He sent it to me.

773
01:18:56,588 --> 01:18:58,590
Why did you take it?

774
01:18:59,842 --> 01:19:02,386
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

775
01:19:04,221 --> 01:19:06,181
That would've been awful.

776
01:19:09,435 --> 01:19:12,646
It wasn't your blood they needed.

777
01:19:15,107 --> 01:19:17,067
It was my father's blood.

778
01:19:18,819 --> 01:19:21,113
My blood.

779
01:19:26,076 --> 01:19:29,622
- The blood of a pirate.
- Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

780
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,137
So you expect to leave me on some beach

781
01:19:45,262 --> 01:19:48,223
with nothing but a name
and your word it's the one I need,

782
01:19:48,349 --> 01:19:52,019
and watch you
sail away in my ship.

783
01:19:52,144 --> 01:19:53,270
No.

784
01:19:53,395 --> 01:19:57,483
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

785
01:19:57,608 --> 01:20:02,613
watching me sail away on my ship, and
then I'll shout the name back to you.

786
01:20:02,738 --> 01:20:03,948
Savvy?

787
01:20:04,073 --> 01:20:06,784
But that still leaves me
standing on some beach,

788
01:20:06,909 --> 01:20:10,996
with naught but a name and
your word it's the one I need.

789
01:20:12,122 --> 01:20:17,294
Of the two of us, I am the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

790
01:20:17,419 --> 01:20:21,340
Therefore, my word
is the one we'll be trusting.

791
01:20:21,423 --> 01:20:25,970
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because, in fact,

792
01:20:26,053 --> 01:20:29,181
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

793
01:20:29,306 --> 01:20:33,978
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

794
01:20:34,103 --> 01:20:36,397
Funny old world, isn't it?

795
01:20:39,024 --> 01:20:41,527
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

796
01:20:54,748 --> 01:20:56,709
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

797
01:20:57,376 --> 01:21:01,088
What say we run up a flag of truce,
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

798
01:21:01,213 --> 01:21:04,466
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion?

799
01:21:05,634 --> 01:21:09,138
Now that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl.

800
01:21:09,263 --> 01:21:11,974
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

801
01:21:13,225 --> 01:21:15,185
Lock him in the brig.

802
01:21:27,364 --> 01:21:29,199
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

803
01:21:29,325 --> 01:21:32,620
With this wind,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

804
01:21:32,745 --> 01:21:36,457
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl is gaining on us!

805
01:21:40,628 --> 01:21:43,339
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

806
01:21:43,464 --> 01:21:45,758
Tell them that after they've caught us.

807
01:21:46,467 --> 01:21:48,886
- We're shallower on the draft, right?
- Aye.

808
01:21:48,969 --> 01:21:51,180
Then can't we lose them
on those shoals?

809
01:21:52,848 --> 01:21:55,726
We don't have to outrun 'em long.
Just long enough.

810
01:21:55,851 --> 01:21:58,145
Lighten the ship!
Stem to stern!

811
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:01,398
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

812
01:22:10,824 --> 01:22:12,785
Apparently, there's a leak.

813
01:22:27,549 --> 01:22:30,636
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

814
01:22:31,512 --> 01:22:33,472
And run out the sweeps.

815
01:23:01,417 --> 01:23:03,502
We're gonna need that.

816
01:23:11,677 --> 01:23:14,430
It was a good plan, up till now.

817
01:23:14,513 --> 01:23:15,931
Gibbs!

818
01:23:16,015 --> 01:23:19,602
We have to make a stand.
We must fight!

819
01:23:19,852 --> 01:23:21,937
- Load the guns!
- With what?

820
01:23:22,062 --> 01:23:25,608
Anything! Everything!
Anything we have left.

821
01:23:27,651 --> 01:23:29,570
Load the guns!

822
01:23:29,695 --> 01:23:33,032
Case shot and langrage!
Nails and crushed glass!

823
01:23:35,618 --> 01:23:37,578
With a will!

824
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:01,143
The Pearl will luff up
on our port quarter.

825
01:24:01,268 --> 01:24:03,771
She'll rake us
without presenting a target.

826
01:24:03,896 --> 01:24:06,398
Lower the anchor on the right side.

827
01:24:06,523 --> 01:24:08,776
On the starboard side!

828
01:24:08,901 --> 01:24:12,780
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady. You both are.

829
01:24:13,113 --> 01:24:15,115
Daft like Jack.

830
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,076
Lower the starboard anchor!

831
01:24:17,409 --> 01:24:20,871
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

832
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:41,850
Let go!

833
01:24:47,273 --> 01:24:49,650
They're club hauling.

834
01:24:49,775 --> 01:24:51,986
Hard a port! Rack the starboard oars!

835
01:24:52,111 --> 01:24:53,779
Hard a port!

836
01:25:05,165 --> 01:25:07,126
Keep her steady, man.

837
01:25:13,549 --> 01:25:15,217
- Now!
- Fire!

838
01:25:15,342 --> 01:25:17,261
Fire all!

839
01:25:26,061 --> 01:25:28,022
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

840
01:26:14,735 --> 01:26:18,489
- We need more ideas, lass!
- It's your turn!

841
01:26:18,656 --> 01:26:21,784
- We need us a devil's dowry!
- We'll give them her!

842
01:26:23,035 --> 01:26:25,329
She's not what they're after.

843
01:26:26,872 --> 01:26:28,207
The medallion.

844
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,940
Strike your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

845
01:26:53,065 --> 01:26:55,734
Hands, grapnels at the ready!

846
01:26:55,859 --> 01:26:57,820
Prepare to board!

847
01:27:32,146 --> 01:27:34,398
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

848
01:27:34,523 --> 01:27:37,234
Koehler, Twigg, to the powder magazine!

849
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:40,446
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

850
01:28:10,267 --> 01:28:11,352
Below!

851
01:28:31,163 --> 01:28:32,206
Thanks very much.

852
01:28:45,761 --> 01:28:47,513
Jack!

853
01:28:48,305 --> 01:28:49,723
Bloody empty!

854
01:29:06,115 --> 01:29:07,658
That's not very nice.

855
01:29:12,162 --> 01:29:14,498
- Where is the medallion?
- Wretch!

856
01:29:17,835 --> 01:29:20,129
Where is dear William?

857
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:22,339
Will.

858
01:29:25,384 --> 01:29:26,802
Elizabeth!

859
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:31,890
Monkey!

860
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:39,398
I can't move it!

861
01:29:42,026 --> 01:29:43,944
Elizabeth!

862
01:29:55,205 --> 01:29:59,043
- Thank you, Jack.
- You're welcome.

863
01:29:59,168 --> 01:30:01,712
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

864
01:30:02,963 --> 01:30:05,924
Gents! Our hope is restored!

865
01:30:41,961 --> 01:30:45,923
Any of you so much
as thinks the word "parley",

866
01:30:46,006 --> 01:30:48,759
I'll have your guts for garters!

867
01:30:56,892 --> 01:30:58,060
Will.

868
01:30:58,727 --> 01:31:00,688
You godless pirate!

869
01:31:01,063 --> 01:31:02,898
Welcome back, miss.

870
01:31:03,148 --> 01:31:05,693
You took advantage of our hospitality
last time.

871
01:31:05,818 --> 01:31:09,280
It holds fair now you return the favor.

872
01:31:15,035 --> 01:31:16,078
Barbossa!

873
01:31:18,122 --> 01:31:19,957
Will.

874
01:31:21,917 --> 01:31:23,919
She goes free!

875
01:31:24,044 --> 01:31:26,338
What's in your head, boy?

876
01:31:27,131 --> 01:31:28,966
She goes free.

877
01:31:29,091 --> 01:31:32,261
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

878
01:31:32,803 --> 01:31:35,639
Don't do anything stupid.

879
01:31:37,516 --> 01:31:39,893
You can't. I can.

880
01:31:41,687 --> 01:31:44,231
Like that.

881
01:31:44,356 --> 01:31:47,860
- Who are you?
- No one. He's no one.

882
01:31:47,985 --> 01:31:51,113
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

883
01:31:51,238 --> 01:31:53,407
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch.

884
01:31:53,532 --> 01:31:57,953
My name is Will Turner!
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

885
01:31:58,078 --> 01:32:00,581
His blood runs in my veins.

886
01:32:00,789 --> 01:32:04,835
It's the spitting image of old
Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us.

887
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,879
On my word, do as I say,

888
01:32:07,004 --> 01:32:11,133
or I'll pull this trigger,
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

889
01:32:12,217 --> 01:32:14,470
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

890
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:17,389
- Elizabeth goes free!
- Yes, we know that one.

891
01:32:17,514 --> 01:32:19,475
Anything else?

892
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:25,022
And the crew. The crew
are not to be harmed.

893
01:32:29,485 --> 01:32:30,986
Agreed.

894
01:32:50,255 --> 01:32:54,551
Barbossa, you lying bastard.
You swore she'd go free.

895
01:32:54,677 --> 01:32:58,639
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.
I agreed she'd go free.

896
01:32:58,764 --> 01:33:01,684
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

897
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:12,361
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

898
01:33:13,612 --> 01:33:16,573
So I'll be havin' that dress back
before you go.

899
01:33:20,911 --> 01:33:23,038
I always liked you.

900
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:28,377
Goes with your black heart.

901
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:31,463
It's still warm.

902
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:36,552
Off you go.

903
01:33:37,177 --> 01:33:39,138
Come on.

904
01:33:42,182 --> 01:33:43,892
Too long.

905
01:33:53,944 --> 01:33:56,405
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

906
01:33:58,032 --> 01:34:01,035
Jack. Jack!

907
01:34:02,202 --> 01:34:03,704
Did you not notice?

908
01:34:03,829 --> 01:34:08,375
That be the same island that we made
you governor of on our last little trip.

909
01:34:09,877 --> 01:34:11,003
I did notice.

910
01:34:11,253 --> 01:34:15,341
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape.

911
01:34:15,466 --> 01:34:17,426
But I doubt it.

912
01:34:19,928 --> 01:34:22,348
Off you go.

913
01:34:22,473 --> 01:34:24,933
Last time you left me a pistol
with one shot.

914
01:34:25,142 --> 01:34:28,896
By the powers, you're right.
Where be Jack's pistol?

915
01:34:29,021 --> 01:34:30,981
Bring it forward.

916
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:38,489
Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols.

917
01:34:38,614 --> 01:34:43,160
It'll be one pistol as before, and you
can be the gentleman and shoot the lady,

918
01:34:43,285 --> 01:34:45,829
and starve to death yourself.

919
01:35:09,561 --> 01:35:13,107
That's the second time
I've watched that man take my ship.

920
01:35:15,609 --> 01:35:19,738
You were marooned on this island before.
We can escape in the same way.

921
01:35:19,947 --> 01:35:22,741
To what point and purpose, young missy?

922
01:35:22,866 --> 01:35:28,706
The Black Pearl is gone. Unless you have
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

923
01:35:28,831 --> 01:35:30,624
Unlikely.

924
01:35:30,749 --> 01:35:34,086
...young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

925
01:35:36,255 --> 01:35:38,465
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

926
01:35:38,716 --> 01:35:43,012
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company.

927
01:35:43,137 --> 01:35:45,806
You sacked Nassau port
without even firing a shot.

928
01:35:45,931 --> 01:35:48,809
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

929
01:35:50,811 --> 01:35:52,521
How did you escape last time?

930
01:35:59,236 --> 01:36:03,657
Last time I was here
a grand total of three days.

931
01:36:04,992 --> 01:36:06,452
Last time...

932
01:36:07,745 --> 01:36:10,998
the rum runners
used this island as a cache.

933
01:36:11,123 --> 01:36:14,043
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

934
01:36:14,168 --> 01:36:17,630
From the looks of things,
they've long been out of business.

935
01:36:17,755 --> 01:36:22,801
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

936
01:36:22,926 --> 01:36:24,887
So that's it, then?

937
01:36:25,721 --> 01:36:29,391
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow.

938
01:36:30,601 --> 01:36:34,730
You spent three days
lying on a beach drinking rum.

939
01:36:37,232 --> 01:36:40,861
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

940
01:36:49,078 --> 01:36:52,206
<i>We're devils, we're black sheep</i>
<i>We're really bad eggs</i>

941
01:36:52,331 --> 01:36:54,291
<i>Drink up, me hearties, yo ho</i>

942
01:36:55,084 --> 01:36:56,418
<i>Yo ho, yo ho</i>

943
01:36:56,543 --> 01:36:59,046
<i>A pirate's life for me</i>

944
01:36:59,171 --> 01:37:01,048
I love this song!

945
01:37:04,093 --> 01:37:06,178
Really bad eggs!

946
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:13,018
When I get the Pearl back,

947
01:37:13,143 --> 01:37:17,273
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,
and we'll sing it all the time.

948
01:37:17,398 --> 01:37:21,110
You will be the most fearsome pirates
in the Spanish Main.

949
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:23,195
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

950
01:37:24,154 --> 01:37:27,491
The entire ocean.
The entire world!

951
01:37:28,534 --> 01:37:32,037
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is.

952
01:37:32,162 --> 01:37:34,915
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

953
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:38,460
That's what a ship needs.
But what a ship is...

954
01:37:40,004 --> 01:37:43,757
What the Black Pearl really is...

955
01:37:44,633 --> 01:37:46,593
is freedom.

956
01:37:48,679 --> 01:37:49,680
Jack...

957
01:37:49,805 --> 01:37:54,602
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

958
01:37:55,394 --> 01:37:56,520
Oh, yes.

959
01:37:56,645 --> 01:38:01,108
But the company is infinitely better
than last time.

960
01:38:01,233 --> 01:38:06,280
And the scenery has definitely improved.

961
01:38:06,405 --> 01:38:07,823
Mr. Sparrow!

962
01:38:07,948 --> 01:38:11,952
I'm not entirely sure I've had enough
rum to allow that kind of talk.

963
01:38:13,662 --> 01:38:15,623
I know exactly what you mean, love.

964
01:38:22,963 --> 01:38:24,465
To freedom!

965
01:38:27,259 --> 01:38:29,219
To the Black Pearl!

966
01:38:58,248 --> 01:38:59,249
No!

967
01:38:59,541 --> 01:39:02,336
Not good! Stop!

968
01:39:02,461 --> 01:39:04,630
Not good! What are you doing?

969
01:39:04,755 --> 01:39:07,466
You've burned all the food,
the shade, the rum.

970
01:39:07,591 --> 01:39:10,886
- Yes, the rum is gone.
- Why is the rum gone?

971
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:15,557
One, because it is a vile drink that
turns respectable men into scoundrels.

972
01:39:15,933 --> 01:39:18,978
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

973
01:39:19,103 --> 01:39:21,313
The entire Royal Navy is looking for me.

974
01:39:21,438 --> 01:39:24,984
Do you think there is the slightest
chance they won't see it?

975
01:39:25,109 --> 01:39:26,652
But why is the rum gone?

976
01:39:28,028 --> 01:39:31,532
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.
You give it one hour, maybe two,

977
01:39:31,657 --> 01:39:35,661
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

978
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:46,088
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

979
01:39:46,213 --> 01:39:48,173
Well, it bloody is now!

980
01:39:55,639 --> 01:39:58,309
There'll be no living with her
after this.

981
01:39:58,434 --> 01:40:00,352
- But we've got to save Will.
- No.

982
01:40:00,477 --> 01:40:04,023
You're safe now. We will return
to Port Royal immediately,

983
01:40:04,148 --> 01:40:06,108
not go gallivanting after pirates.

984
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:08,193
Then we condemn him to death.

985
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:14,617
The boy's fate is regrettable, but
so is his decision to engage in piracy.

986
01:40:14,742 --> 01:40:17,911
To rescue me. To prevent anything
from happening to me.

987
01:40:18,037 --> 01:40:22,291
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion.

988
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:28,047
The Pearl was listing to scuppers after
the battle. She won't make good time.

989
01:40:28,172 --> 01:40:32,051
Think about it. The Black Pearl.

990
01:40:32,176 --> 01:40:35,929
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

991
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:39,099
How can you pass that up?

992
01:40:40,517 --> 01:40:44,897
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr. Sparrow, not only myself.

993
01:40:45,022 --> 01:40:48,609
Commodore, I beg you,
please do this for me.

994
01:40:48,734 --> 01:40:50,819
As a wedding gift.

995
01:40:50,945 --> 01:40:53,072
Elizabeth?

996
01:40:53,197 --> 01:40:55,699
Are you accepting
the Commodore's proposal?

997
01:40:58,619 --> 01:40:59,620
I am.

998
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:03,582
A wedding. I love weddings.
Drinks all around!

999
01:41:05,918 --> 01:41:08,629
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

1000
01:41:11,215 --> 01:41:15,386
Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1001
01:41:15,511 --> 01:41:18,889
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

1002
01:41:19,014 --> 01:41:24,979
Then contemplate all possible meanings
of the phrase "silent as the grave".

1003
01:41:25,229 --> 01:41:28,857
- Do I make myself clear?
- Inescapably clear.

1004
01:41:32,778 --> 01:41:36,198
Shiver me timbers.

1005
01:41:36,323 --> 01:41:38,325
Cotton here says you missed a bit.

1006
01:41:42,746 --> 01:41:45,874
You knew William Turner.

1007
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,961
Old Bootstrap Bill, we knew him.

1008
01:41:50,045 --> 01:41:52,756
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we
did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.

1009
01:41:52,798 --> 01:41:55,509
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we
did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.

1010
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,722
He said it wasn't right with the Code.

1011
01:41:59,847 --> 01:42:02,808
That's why he sent off
a piece of the treasure to you.

1012
01:42:04,602 --> 01:42:06,895
He said we deserved to be cursed,

1013
01:42:08,105 --> 01:42:10,149
and remain cursed.

1014
01:42:10,274 --> 01:42:13,152
- Stupid blighter.
- Good man.

1015
01:42:13,277 --> 01:42:18,949
But, as you can imagine, that didn't
sit too well with the Captain.

1016
01:42:19,074 --> 01:42:21,785
That didn't sit too well
with the Captain at all.

1017
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:25,497
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

1018
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:34,798
So what the captain did, he strapped
a cannon to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1019
01:42:34,923 --> 01:42:36,383
Bootstrap's bootstraps!

1020
01:42:36,508 --> 01:42:41,972
Last we saw of old Bill Turner, he was
sinking into the crushin' black oblivion

1021
01:42:42,097 --> 01:42:45,225
of Davy Jones' locker!

1022
01:42:46,143 --> 01:42:50,773
It was only after that we learned
we needed his blood to lift the curse.

1023
01:42:50,898 --> 01:42:53,192
That's what you call ironic.

1024
01:42:58,113 --> 01:43:00,074
Bring him.

1025
01:43:06,038 --> 01:43:08,082
I don't care for the situation.

1026
01:43:08,457 --> 01:43:11,710
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1027
01:43:11,835 --> 01:43:15,130
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1028
01:43:15,255 --> 01:43:18,884
I go in and get Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1029
01:43:19,009 --> 01:43:25,057
Your mates return to the Dauntless
and blast them with your cannons.

1030
01:43:25,182 --> 01:43:27,434
What do you have to lose?

1031
01:43:27,559 --> 01:43:30,521
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1032
01:43:31,689 --> 01:43:36,443
Now, to be honest, there's a risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1033
01:43:36,568 --> 01:43:40,447
which includes the future Mrs. Commodore.

1034
01:43:40,572 --> 01:43:44,576
- It's for your own safety.
- I don't care, I have to tell him!

1035
01:43:44,702 --> 01:43:47,788
The pirates are cursed!
They can't be killed!

1036
01:43:47,913 --> 01:43:54,128
He's already informed of that. A mermaid
flopped up on deck and told the story.

1037
01:43:54,253 --> 01:43:57,214
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1038
01:44:07,891 --> 01:44:11,937
No reason to fret. A prick of the
finger, a few drops of blood...

1039
01:44:12,062 --> 01:44:17,443
No mistakes this time. He's only
half-Turner. We spill it all!

1040
01:44:19,778 --> 01:44:22,448
Guess there is reason to fret.

1041
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:41,759
- Beg your pardon.
- Begun by blood. By blood...

1042
01:44:45,054 --> 01:44:46,680
Jack!

1043
01:44:46,805 --> 01:44:49,850
- It's not possible.
- Not probable.

1044
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:52,686
Where's Elizabeth?

1045
01:44:53,103 --> 01:44:58,317
Safe, like I promised. She's set to
marry Norrington, like she promised,

1046
01:44:58,442 --> 01:45:00,819
and you get to die for her
like you promised.

1047
01:45:00,945 --> 01:45:06,325
So we're all men of our word, except
for Elizabeth, who is a woman.

1048
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:08,911
Shut up! You're next!

1049
01:45:11,455 --> 01:45:16,251
- You don't want to be doing that.
- No, I think I do.

1050
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:19,922
Your funeral.

1051
01:45:23,175 --> 01:45:26,845
- Why don't I want to be doing it?
- Because...

1052
01:45:27,888 --> 01:45:32,685
The HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

1053
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:37,564
is floating just offshore
waiting for you.

1054
01:45:46,031 --> 01:45:48,242
What are we doing here?

1055
01:45:49,118 --> 01:45:52,454
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1056
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:58,127
We catch 'em in a crossfire
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

1057
01:45:58,836 --> 01:46:05,259
I meant, why aren't we doing
what Mr. Sparrow said we should do?

1058
01:46:05,384 --> 01:46:10,264
- With the cannons and all?
- Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1059
01:46:12,474 --> 01:46:14,852
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1060
01:46:15,185 --> 01:46:17,730
Hear me out, mate.

1061
01:46:17,855 --> 01:46:21,775
Order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best,

1062
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:26,322
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your
aunt... There you are with two ships.

1063
01:46:26,447 --> 01:46:28,616
The makings of your own fleet.

1064
01:46:28,741 --> 01:46:32,328
You'll take the grandest as your
flagship and who's to argue?

1065
01:46:32,453 --> 01:46:35,372
But what of the Pearl?

1066
01:46:35,497 --> 01:46:40,252
Name me captain, I'll sail under your
colors and give you 10% of me plunder

1067
01:46:40,377 --> 01:46:47,092
and you get to introduce yourself
as Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?

1068
01:46:47,217 --> 01:46:51,138
And in exchange you want me
not to kill the whelp.

1069
01:46:51,263 --> 01:46:56,393
Not at all. By all means,
kill the whelp. Just not yet.

1070
01:46:56,518 --> 01:47:01,398
Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

1071
01:47:04,944 --> 01:47:06,487
For instance...

1072
01:47:08,364 --> 01:47:11,617
after you've killed Norrington's men.

1073
01:47:11,742 --> 01:47:13,285
Every...

1074
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:15,037
last...

1075
01:47:15,162 --> 01:47:16,538
one.

1076
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:30,219
You've planned this ever since
you learned my name.

1077
01:47:31,053 --> 01:47:32,721
Yeah.

1078
01:47:34,056 --> 01:47:36,266
I want 50% of your plunder.

1079
01:47:36,392 --> 01:47:37,559
- 15.
- 40.

1080
01:47:37,685 --> 01:47:39,103
25.

1081
01:47:39,812 --> 01:47:43,190
I'll buy you the hat.
A really big one.

1082
01:47:44,024 --> 01:47:45,818
Commodore.

1083
01:47:48,279 --> 01:47:50,406
We have an accord.

1084
01:47:51,156 --> 01:47:53,409
All hands to the boats!

1085
01:47:54,326 --> 01:47:57,204
Apologies. You give the orders.

1086
01:47:58,539 --> 01:48:02,001
Gents... take a walk!

1087
01:48:07,214 --> 01:48:09,341
Not to the boats?

1088
01:49:07,691 --> 01:49:09,693
Hold fire.

1089
01:49:12,655 --> 01:49:16,033
This is like what the Greeks
done at Troy.

1090
01:49:16,867 --> 01:49:21,830
Except they was in a horse,
instead of dresses. Wooden horse.

1091
01:49:35,094 --> 01:49:37,137
A moment, please.

1092
01:49:40,265 --> 01:49:41,976
Elizabeth?

1093
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:49,858
I want you to know I believe you made
a very good decision today.

1094
01:49:50,484 --> 01:49:53,028
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1095
01:49:53,153 --> 01:49:58,701
But a good decision, if made for the
wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision.

1096
01:50:07,710 --> 01:50:09,378
Lieutenant.

1097
01:50:27,938 --> 01:50:29,732
Elizabeth?

1098
01:50:31,233 --> 01:50:33,611
Are you there?

1099
01:50:34,778 --> 01:50:37,323
Are you even listening to me?

1100
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:06,644
What have you done?

1101
01:51:07,686 --> 01:51:10,272
Stop that! I already feel like a fool.

1102
01:51:11,315 --> 01:51:13,567
You look nice, though.

1103
01:51:17,237 --> 01:51:19,615
I look nice?

1104
01:51:55,484 --> 01:51:58,696
I must admit, Jack, I thought
I had you figured

1105
01:51:58,821 --> 01:52:01,991
but it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1106
01:52:02,116 --> 01:52:06,954
I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man
you can trust to be dishonest.

1107
01:52:07,079 --> 01:52:11,542
Honestly, it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

1108
01:52:11,667 --> 01:52:17,673
You can never predict when they're going
to do something incredibly... stupid.

1109
01:52:50,914 --> 01:52:55,169
You're off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters!

1110
01:53:00,007 --> 01:53:01,717
Right.

1111
01:53:03,093 --> 01:53:05,095
What would you eat first?

1112
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:09,350
We should decide now so we're ready
when the time comes.

1113
01:53:34,541 --> 01:53:36,543
What was that?

1114
01:53:58,524 --> 01:53:59,566
Miss Elizabeth!

1115
01:54:20,254 --> 01:54:21,755
Make for the ship! Move!

1116
01:54:31,223 --> 01:54:33,017
To the ship!

1117
01:54:35,811 --> 01:54:37,646
Row, men!

1118
01:55:15,225 --> 01:55:17,144
You can't beat me, Jack.

1119
01:55:41,627 --> 01:55:43,796
That's interesting.

1120
01:55:53,806 --> 01:55:55,808
I couldn't resist, mate.

1121
01:57:02,124 --> 01:57:03,292
Sorry!

1122
01:57:11,967 --> 01:57:14,053
What now, Jack Sparrow?

1123
01:57:14,178 --> 01:57:19,642
Are we to be two immortals, locked
in an epic battle until Judgment Day?

1124
01:57:20,392 --> 01:57:22,478
Or you could surrender.

1125
01:57:48,921 --> 01:57:52,424
All of you with me. Will is in that cave
and we must save him.

1126
01:57:52,549 --> 01:57:55,094
Ready, and... heave!

1127
01:58:01,809 --> 01:58:03,686
I need your help. Come on!

1128
01:58:03,811 --> 01:58:06,605
Any port in a storm.

1129
01:58:06,730 --> 01:58:09,149
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl.

1130
01:58:09,275 --> 01:58:12,903
- Are you gonna leave Jack?
- Jack owes us a ship.

1131
01:58:13,195 --> 01:58:16,365
- There's the Code to consider.
- The Code?

1132
01:58:17,908 --> 01:58:22,121
You're pirates. Hang the Code
and hang the rules!

1133
01:58:22,246 --> 01:58:24,540
They're more like guidelines.

1134
01:58:28,419 --> 01:58:30,504
Bloody pirates!

1135
01:58:42,016 --> 01:58:44,143
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1136
01:58:44,268 --> 01:58:46,687
They're stealing our ship.

1137
01:58:46,812 --> 01:58:48,606
Bloody pirates!

1138
01:58:50,649 --> 01:58:52,484
Boarders away.

1139
01:59:00,826 --> 01:59:02,620
Come on!

1140
01:59:28,729 --> 01:59:30,689
Me eye!

1141
01:59:50,042 --> 01:59:52,086
I'll teach you the meaning of pain.

1142
01:59:52,211 --> 01:59:54,421
You like pain?

1143
01:59:55,547 --> 01:59:57,675
Try wearing a corset.

1144
02:00:07,476 --> 02:00:09,687
Whose side is Jack on?

1145
02:00:09,812 --> 02:00:12,106
At the moment?

1146
02:00:47,182 --> 02:00:49,018
No fair!

1147
02:01:12,374 --> 02:01:16,629
Ten years you carry that pistol
and now you waste your shot.

1148
02:01:17,421 --> 02:01:20,299
He didn't waste it.

1149
02:01:45,032 --> 02:01:47,117
I feel...

1150
02:01:51,121 --> 02:01:53,499
cold.

1151
02:02:54,768 --> 02:02:56,895
Parley?

1152
02:02:57,396 --> 02:03:01,483
- The ship is ours, gentlemen.
- Huzzah!

1153
02:03:07,615 --> 02:03:10,284
Huzzah! Huzzah!

1154
02:03:47,613 --> 02:03:49,615
We should return to the Dauntless.

1155
02:03:52,117 --> 02:03:55,788
Your fiancé will want to know
you're safe.

1156
02:04:05,631 --> 02:04:09,385
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

1157
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:11,720
that was it.

1158
02:04:12,721 --> 02:04:17,351
Now, I'd be much obliged
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1159
02:04:22,231 --> 02:04:24,358
I'm sorry, Jack.

1160
02:04:26,485 --> 02:04:31,615
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

1161
02:04:46,171 --> 02:04:48,340
Jack Sparrow...

1162
02:04:49,174 --> 02:04:51,593
Captain Jack Sparrow.

1163
02:04:52,303 --> 02:04:55,472
...for your crimes against the Crown.

1164
02:04:56,849 --> 02:05:01,270
Said crimes being numerous in quantity
and sinister in nature.

1165
02:05:02,021 --> 02:05:05,608
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith:

1166
02:05:05,733 --> 02:05:08,319
Piracy, smuggling...

1167
02:05:08,444 --> 02:05:10,613
This is wrong.

1168
02:05:10,738 --> 02:05:15,743
Commodore Norrington is bound
by the law, as are we all.

1169
02:05:16,035 --> 02:05:19,371
...impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1170
02:05:19,496 --> 02:05:23,125
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England,

1171
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:28,464
sailing under false colors,
arson, kidnapping, looting,

1172
02:05:28,589 --> 02:05:32,509
poaching, brigandage, pilfering,

1173
02:05:32,635 --> 02:05:37,056
depravity, depredation
and general lawlessness.

1174
02:05:38,724 --> 02:05:45,606
For these crimes, you are sentenced
to be hung by the neck until dead.

1175
02:05:46,982 --> 02:05:49,318
May God have mercy on your soul.

1176
02:05:49,443 --> 02:05:51,570
Governor Swann.

1177
02:05:51,695 --> 02:05:53,614
Commodore.

1178
02:05:54,239 --> 02:05:56,408
Elizabeth.

1179
02:05:56,533 --> 02:06:01,205
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you...

1180
02:06:02,748 --> 02:06:04,833
I love you.

1181
02:06:18,389 --> 02:06:19,932
Watch yourself!

1182
02:06:20,391 --> 02:06:21,809
Marines!

1183
02:06:21,934 --> 02:06:23,894
I can't breathe.

1184
02:06:24,353 --> 02:06:25,562
Elizabeth!

1185
02:06:28,774 --> 02:06:30,401
Move!

1186
02:07:43,766 --> 02:07:48,228
I thought we might have to endure
some ill-conceived escape attempt,

1187
02:07:48,354 --> 02:07:50,314
but not from you.

1188
02:07:50,439 --> 02:07:53,609
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1189
02:07:53,734 --> 02:07:58,489
And this is how you thank me?
By throwing in your lot with him?

1190
02:07:58,614 --> 02:08:01,200
- He's a pirate.
- And a good man.

1191
02:08:03,035 --> 02:08:08,165
If this means the hangman will earn two
pairs of boots instead of one, so be it.

1192
02:08:08,290 --> 02:08:10,000
My conscience will be clear.

1193
02:08:10,125 --> 02:08:13,087
You forget your place, Turner.

1194
02:08:14,922 --> 02:08:19,134
It's right here, between you and Jack.

1195
02:08:22,638 --> 02:08:24,932
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.

1196
02:08:26,517 --> 02:08:30,354
Lower your weapons.
Put them down!

1197
02:08:35,484 --> 02:08:38,404
So this is where your heart truly lies?

1198
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:41,573
It is.

1199
02:08:50,332 --> 02:08:53,877
I'm feeling good about this.

1200
02:08:54,003 --> 02:08:56,380
We've all arrived at a special place.

1201
02:08:56,505 --> 02:09:01,760
Spiritually, ecumenically,
grammatically.

1202
02:09:02,636 --> 02:09:06,515
I want you to know
that I was rooting for you, mate.

1203
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:08,517
Know that.

1204
02:09:11,687 --> 02:09:13,897
Elizabeth.

1205
02:09:15,316 --> 02:09:18,736
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1206
02:09:19,028 --> 02:09:20,696
I'm sorry.

1207
02:09:23,282 --> 02:09:25,284
Will.

1208
02:09:26,452 --> 02:09:28,829
Nice hat.

1209
02:09:29,580 --> 02:09:31,290
Friends.

1210
02:09:33,667 --> 02:09:38,589
This is the day that you will always
remember as the day that...

1211
02:09:43,886 --> 02:09:46,305
Idiot. He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1212
02:09:48,766 --> 02:09:50,559
Sail ho!

1213
02:09:58,192 --> 02:10:00,527
What's your plan of action?

1214
02:10:01,487 --> 02:10:03,280
Sir!

1215
02:10:07,117 --> 02:10:10,788
Perhaps on the rare occasion,
pursuing the right course

1216
02:10:10,913 --> 02:10:13,123
demands an act of piracy.

1217
02:10:13,582 --> 02:10:17,127
Piracy itself can be the right course.

1218
02:10:21,674 --> 02:10:23,676
Mr. Turner.

1219
02:10:28,722 --> 02:10:31,642
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1220
02:10:37,481 --> 02:10:39,900
This is a beautiful sword.

1221
02:10:41,944 --> 02:10:43,821
I expect the man who made it

1222
02:10:43,946 --> 02:10:48,325
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1223
02:10:50,369 --> 02:10:52,079
Thank you.

1224
02:10:54,957 --> 02:10:57,835
Commodore! What about Sparrow?

1225
02:10:59,753 --> 02:11:04,008
I think we can afford to give him
one day's head start.

1226
02:11:09,138 --> 02:11:11,390
So...

1227
02:11:12,016 --> 02:11:14,935
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1228
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:20,190
After all, he is a blacksmith.

1229
02:11:21,317 --> 02:11:23,319
No.

1230
02:11:27,573 --> 02:11:29,408
He's a pirate.

1231
02:12:06,111 --> 02:12:09,114
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the Code?

1232
02:12:09,239 --> 02:12:13,077
We figured they were more
actual... guidelines.

1233
02:12:17,498 --> 02:12:18,999
Thank you.

1234
02:12:20,125 --> 02:12:22,294
Captain Sparrow.

1235
02:12:25,756 --> 02:12:28,008
The Black Pearl is yours.

1236
02:12:43,232 --> 02:12:48,988
On deck, you scabrous dogs! Hands
to braces! Let go and haul to run free!

1237
02:12:50,614 --> 02:12:54,201
Now... bring me that horizon.

1238
02:13:01,583 --> 02:13:04,253
<i>And really bad eggs</i>

1239
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:09,258
Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho!
