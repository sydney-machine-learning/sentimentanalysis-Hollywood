1
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,743
Before the end
of the season last year...

2
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:55,622
...and then re-injured it
in spring training...

3
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,291
...on a terrific game-saving play.

4
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:00,502
You know, I was talking with...

5
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:04,547
What time is this going on?
7:30 is the pre-game.

6
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:07,759
Who'd you say was pitching?
Tiant's pitching.

7
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:11,971
Goddamn Cuban. He can hurl it.
I'd hate to be facing him.

8
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:15,184
Who are they playing, Yankees?
Yankees.

9
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:18,020
Imagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball
coming at you.

10
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:19,939
- You don't have time to think.
Hey, guys!

11
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:22,525
What kind of night
you think Fisk will have?

12
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:24,860
He's been hot lately.

13
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:30,241
He gets on base twice tonight,
gets on base twice, I'll paint your porch.

14
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,339
Save.

15
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:46,757
The sewer.

16
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:56,267
Hold on, I'll get it.

17
00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:01,064
Sorry, guys, I guess I don't
know my own strength.

18
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:04,901
You know what, Dave? That must be it.

19
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:12,325
Hey...

20
00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:15,745
...you guys know what
would be really cool?

21
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:18,540
What?
- Driving a car.

22
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,792
You know, just around the block.

23
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,752
Yeah?

24
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,423
Anyone on this street
keep their keys in their car?

25
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:30,343
I steal a car, my dad will kill me.

26
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:33,388
Just around the block. Who said steal?

27
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,779
Your dad kill you
for writing your name too?

28
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:10,509
See, now it'll be there forever.

29
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:14,138
Me too.

30
00:03:16,516 --> 00:03:18,309
Forever.

31
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:23,981
Let me ask you something.

32
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:31,613
You brats think it's okay to destroy
municipal property?

33
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:37,203
Come here.

34
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:40,998
Get over here.

35
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:55,513
Well, do you?

36
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,849
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

37
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:01,477
- No.
- No, what?

38
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,648
Sir.

39
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:08,526
You're the hard case of the group, huh?

40
00:04:11,363 --> 00:04:13,406
A pack of punks, huh?

41
00:04:16,243 --> 00:04:18,703
You live around here?

42
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,039
Right there.

43
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,920
You?

44
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:29,089
Right over there.

45
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:33,218
How about you?
Where do you live, son?

46
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:38,598
- Rester Street.
- Is your mother home?

47
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:50,402
We're gonna go have a talk with her.
Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.

48
00:04:57,827 --> 00:05:00,078
Get in.

49
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:04,583
Get the fuck inside.

50
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:22,310
In.

51
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:30,068
You kids go tell your mothers
what you've been up to.

52
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:39,619
And don't let me catch you shits
ruining my sidewalks again.

53
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,317
What do you mean?
Who put Dave in a car?

54
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:12,444
The cop. He had a gold badge.

55
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:15,656
How do you know it was a cop?
See anything on the badge?

56
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:18,158
- No, no writing.
- He had a uniform on?

57
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:19,993
Like a regular police uniform?

58
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:22,329
He was a cop.
He took Davey.

59
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:26,500
- So, what were you guys doing?
- We wrote our names in the cement...

60
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:30,212
You were writing in cement
and playing hockey, but they took Dave?

61
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,966
- That doesn't make sense. Come on.
Is there something wrong, Dad?

62
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:55,196
Please.

63
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:57,282
No more.

64
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,201
Please.

65
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:03,705
No more, please.

66
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:35,404
Have you seen him?
- Looks like damaged goods to me.

67
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,490
Jesus.

68
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,110
You took some good swings today.

69
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,697
Dad, I struck out.

70
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:21,493
Good swings, though.
That's what counts.

71
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:25,163
I'll never be a good ballplayer.

72
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:29,960
Hey, you're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.

73
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:34,756
Star shortstop, Trinity High School,
1978 to '82.

74
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:37,592
You're gonna be a great ballplayer.

75
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:41,471
Hey.

76
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,807
- See that gutter drain over there?
- Yeah.

77
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:49,103
I used to play on this street
when I was a kid.

78
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:52,606
That drain swallowed every ball we had.

79
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:56,235
Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.

80
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,363
If we could get that manhole cover up...

81
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:01,490
...could be 1000 balls down there.

82
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:04,828
Really? Let's try.

83
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:35,275
Get in.

84
00:09:35,443 --> 00:09:38,278
Come on, Dad,
come help me hunt for balls.

85
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:43,533
Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home
before Mom starts to worry.

86
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:58,341
Jimmy. Jimmy.

87
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,594
Earth to Mr. Markum.

88
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:05,348
- What do you want now, Pete?
- Like I'm Mr. Needy all of a sudden?

89
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:08,392
We're out of the Marlboros
and the Winstons are looking grim.

90
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,436
- So?
- So that means less profit...

91
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:13,731
...and more profit means I get a raise.

92
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:15,441
So why don't you order more.

93
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:18,903
All right, but if the
Surgeon General calls, you're my alibi.

94
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:35,836
- Hey, you.
- Hey, there.

95
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:39,091
I'm going out tonight
with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.

96
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:43,220
Don't stay out too late. You got your
sister's First Communion tomorrow.

97
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:46,765
- Christ, I sound like...
- Someone's father?

98
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:49,267
Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.

99
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:54,773
- Later, Daddy.
- Later.

100
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:56,650
Have fun.

101
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:04,616
- Later.
- Later.

102
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:32,770
Brendan.

103
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:37,984
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Sorry, I didn't want your dad to see me.

104
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:42,822
He sees you sneaking
into my car, he'll shoot you.

105
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,160
What will he do if he sees this?

106
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:50,872
Shoot you and then kill you.

107
00:11:56,044 --> 00:11:57,712
It's been six hours.

108
00:11:58,046 --> 00:12:00,339
I had to see you.

109
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:05,136
I'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.

110
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:09,223
Tomorrow?

111
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:11,518
Like we planned?

112
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:14,146
Tomorrow.

113
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:20,402
Drop me around the corner.

114
00:12:51,893 --> 00:12:54,728
Take it easy.
He kept cutting me off!

115
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:59,150
He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!

116
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:03,404
He followed me all the way from
Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me!

117
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:04,948
That son of a bitch!

118
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:08,409
Oh, can you believe this guy
keeps confessing?

119
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:12,747
I don't know. Maybe we ought to grab a
lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.

120
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,584
Hey, Devine?

121
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,384
- What you looking at?
- The old neighborhood.

122
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:31,599
We're done, but I can stay.
- No, I think we're good, thanks.

123
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:36,396
Um, a few of us are going
to the Cantab after.

124
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,526
No, I don't think so, Jen.
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

125
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:43,903
Yeah.

126
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,784
- So the wife left you six months ago?
- So?

127
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:52,246
So Jenny Coughlin there
with the body, voice and the cuffs...

128
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,374
This girl, she makes gay guys
rethink their orientation.

129
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:56,959
So, what's your point?

130
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,837
The girl just wants to bed you,
not wed you. You don't even blink?

131
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:03,506
She wants to worship
at the temple of Sean Devine.

132
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:06,801
I'm married, Whitey.
- So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.

133
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:09,554
You haven't talked to Lauren
in six months.

134
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:11,180
She calls all the time.

135
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:14,475
And says absolutely nothing.
Weirdest thing I ever heard of.

136
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:18,521
One of these days, the phone's gonna
ring and she'll tell me why she left.

137
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:21,983
Yeah? Maybe she's waiting
for you to say something.

138
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:44,048
Come on, come on, come on.

139
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:48,802
The pitch. A swing and
a line drive into right field. A base hit.

140
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,014
I just don't feel like
they're gonna win this one.

141
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,942
Could we please have three beers?

142
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:11,825
Yeah, come on.

143
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,801
You believe those chicks?

144
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,306
Come on.
Oh, yeah, baby.

145
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,601
Hey.

146
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,104
Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?

147
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,816
- We've got you right over here, boys.
Yeah.

148
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,776
Yeah.

149
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,738
I've known her since she was a kid.

150
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,084
A ball and two strikes. Two on, two out.

151
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,637
Dave.

152
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,724
It's 3 in the morning.

153
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,142
Where have you been?

154
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:20,938
Oh, my God.

155
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,649
I fucked up.

156
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,776
What happened?

157
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:30,781
This guy tried to mug me,
and I swung on him and he sliced me.

158
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,744
But look at your hand.
We gotta go to the hospital.

159
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,289
No, no, it's not that bad.
It's not that deep.

160
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:42,293
- It bled like hell. I can't go to the hospital.
- Oh, my God, Dave.

161
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,755
Come on. Come here.

162
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:52,053
So I'm walking to my car, and this
guy comes up to me, he asks for a light.

163
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,432
I say I don't smoke.
He says neither does he.

164
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,186
My heart starts clocking a buck fifty
because there's no one around.

165
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,813
- Oh, God.
- That's when I see the knife.

166
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:05,108
Says, "Your wallet or your life.
I'm leaving with one of them. "

167
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:06,818
- That's what he said?
- Yeah.

168
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:10,322
So I try to brush past him.
That's when he slices me.

169
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,285
- You said you swung on him first.
- Celeste, can I tell the fucking story?

170
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:18,205
I'm sorry, babe.

171
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,707
Shh.

172
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:24,586
I went fucking nuts on him, baby. I...

173
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,673
I went off.

174
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:32,344
I bashed his head on the parking lot.

175
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:36,014
There was blood everywhere.

176
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:40,478
I might have killed him.

177
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:44,357
Killed him?

178
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:54,700
It makes you feel...

179
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:57,245
...alone, you know, hurting somebody.

180
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,166
Yeah, but you had to, right?

181
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,211
It makes you feel...

182
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,880
...alien.

183
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:17,348
Okay.

184
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:20,351
Babe, you hop in the shower.

185
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,105
And I'll take care of your clothes.

186
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,443
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

187
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:30,445
Here.

188
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:45,752
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

189
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,423
There's, like, this car
with blood in it, and the door's open.

190
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,342
What's the location of the car?
Sydney Street.

191
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,430
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend just found it.

192
00:18:56,598 --> 00:18:59,266
Son, what's your name?
He wants to know her name.

193
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:00,976
Your name, what's your name?

194
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:03,770
We're so fucking out of here.
Good luck, man.

195
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,202
Dispatch, this is Unit 33.

196
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:23,457
We're gonna need a crime-scene tech,
and you might want to notify Homicide.

197
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:27,502
Thirty-three, have you
found a body yet? Over.

198
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,632
No, but by the looks
of this car, we'll find one sooner or later.

199
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:47,231
- Yeah?
I'm in the weeds at the store...

200
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:48,774
...and I need some help.

201
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:52,694
You and Katie can't handle 6,
how you gonna handle the church crowd?

202
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:56,531
- That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
- Hold on.

203
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,585
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

204
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:11,506
Just call Sal, make sure he can
get there at 8 instead of 10.

205
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:14,342
No-shows at work,
what if she no-shows at church?

206
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,885
She'll be there.

207
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:18,680
You know, she's gonna
screw up this day too.

208
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:22,058
Oh, what other day
has she screwed up lately?

209
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:24,394
You got two other daughters,
don't forget.

210
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:28,523
I'll be at the church before anybody else,
don't worry about that.

211
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:30,692
What the fuck's going on here?

212
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:43,204
Pete, anybody show?
- No.

213
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:45,373
Katie didn't call?

214
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,292
No.

215
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:59,930
Hello?
- Drew, Jimmy.

216
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:02,224
Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for Katie.

217
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:06,353
Yeah, she's here, I think.
Hang on a second, let me go check.

218
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:11,567
Have a nice day.

219
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:14,820
No, it was Diane Cestra
who slept over. No Katie.

220
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:19,033
Eve said she dropped her off at around
1:00. Didn't say where she was going.

221
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,909
Don't worry, I'll track her down.

222
00:21:21,077 --> 00:21:24,913
- She seeing anybody maybe?
- 19-year-old girls, who can keep a tally?

223
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:28,292
- That's the cold truth, bud.
- I'll talk to you later.

224
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,428
I'll take hookers
over old ladies any day.

225
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:41,306
- Mind if I go grab a smoke?
- You can smoke the whole pack.

226
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,016
Thanks.

227
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:57,113
Can I help you, Brendan?

228
00:21:58,074 --> 00:22:01,534
No, Mr. Markum, I'm looking
for some of that tea that my ma likes.

229
00:22:01,702 --> 00:22:04,996
- That's Barry's. Next aisle.
Thanks.

230
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:21,514
When's Sal getting here?
Anytime now.

231
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:24,642
- That it, Bren?
- A Globe.

232
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:28,771
I thought Katie worked on Sundays.

233
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:31,982
Are you sweet
on my man's daughter, Bren?

234
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,069
No, I just see her here sometimes.

235
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:38,030
Her little sister's making
her First Communion today.

236
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:39,365
Oh.

237
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,951
Thanks. Come on, Ray.

238
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:56,549
Can I ask you something, Jimmy?

239
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,176
Shoot.

240
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,512
Why do you hate that kid so bad?

241
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:06,016
It's not hate. Doesn't that little
mute fucker spook you out sometimes?

242
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,354
No, not Silent Ray, Brendan.

243
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:13,608
He's nice. Does sign language with his
brother even though he doesn't have to.

244
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:15,694
He doesn't want him to feel alone.

245
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:19,030
But you look at Brendan
like you're two steps away...

246
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,867
...from slicing off his nose
and feeding it to him.

247
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:25,245
- No. Really?
- Straight up.

248
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,877
Here's Sal. About fucking time.

249
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:48,727
Hey, there, bad boy.
- Sarge.

250
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:53,648
This should be the city's,
but the park's state jurisdiction.

251
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:56,194
So if the body's in there,
the case is ours.

252
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:01,240
How much evidence do you
think they've destroyed?

253
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:02,700
Let's go find out.

254
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:05,286
Parker Hill vic walks into the ER
on his own...

255
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:07,830
...steak knife sticking out
of his collarbone.

256
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:11,250
He asks the nurse, "Hey, where they
keep the Coke machine?"

257
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:14,795
- Did she tell him?
What do we got on the car so far?

258
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:18,633
We found the registration in the
glove box. Owner is Katherine Markum.

259
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,343
- Oh, shit.
- You know her?

260
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:23,095
Maybe. Might be the daughter
of a guy I know.

261
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:26,974
We found a wallet and a license
in a backpack. She's 19.

262
00:24:27,142 --> 00:24:31,103
- Oh, fuck, that's her.
- Is it a problem? You close with the guy?

263
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:35,607
When we were kids. Now it's just
a "hello" around the neighborhood.

264
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:39,611
Nineteen.

265
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,571
Fuck, man.

266
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:44,325
He's in for a world of hurt.

267
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:14,105
Do not make her laugh.

268
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:24,240
Door was ajar when we found it,
headlights on.

269
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:28,703
Blood on the driver's door, speaker,
more blood on top of the steering wheel...

270
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:33,166
...around this bullet hole. Punched through
the driver's seatback, shoulder level.

271
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:35,377
Okay, perp stood outside the car...

272
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:38,505
...girl slams him with the door,
perp gets a round off...

273
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:41,675
...hits her in the shoulder,
maybe the bicep.

274
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:45,053
She runs for it
through the trampled weeds...

275
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:49,933
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I dig that.

276
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:53,145
Body of Christ.

277
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:56,481
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

278
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:00,777
My God, Jimmy, our baby.

279
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:07,534
Body of Christ.

280
00:26:08,536 --> 00:26:14,207
Body of Christ.

281
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:19,297
So I'm thinking she hid
out here for a little bit.

282
00:26:19,465 --> 00:26:20,923
The killer shows, she bolts.

283
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:24,677
She goes to the other side,
she takes off running again.

284
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:28,097
Well, we better call in some divers
while we're at it.

285
00:26:35,356 --> 00:26:37,231
Body of Christ.

286
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:41,653
Body of Christ.

287
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:55,208
So you haven't seen him
in a long time or what?

288
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:59,420
No, I haven't seen him since we
were kids. Once in a while, I run into him.

289
00:27:00,047 --> 00:27:02,256
Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?

290
00:27:02,591 --> 00:27:06,387
Daddy, Daddy!
Hey, darling. Good day, huh?

291
00:27:06,554 --> 00:27:08,097
This dress itches.

292
00:27:08,264 --> 00:27:11,934
Yeah, I'm not even wearing it,
and it's itching me.

293
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:14,436
We are so proud of you.

294
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:35,791
- Morning, honey.
- Dave.

295
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:40,129
There's nothing about it in the papers.
I checked three times.

296
00:27:40,296 --> 00:27:43,465
It was late, real late.

297
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:47,845
- Morning, Mikey.
Morning, Dad.

298
00:27:48,722 --> 00:27:52,642
- You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
- Yeah, come on, let's go.

299
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:55,979
Come on.

300
00:27:58,774 --> 00:28:00,984
Put your coat on, Mike.

301
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,278
Thanks, Mom.

302
00:28:14,665 --> 00:28:16,958
- Hey, Jimmy.
- What's up, Ed?

303
00:28:17,126 --> 00:28:19,836
They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.

304
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:24,215
Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going
into the Pen. Why you all decked out?

305
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:27,177
- Nadine's First Communion.
- What are you doing here?

306
00:28:27,344 --> 00:28:29,888
Just curious, I guess.

307
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:48,491
That's my daughter's car.

308
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:54,079
The dog's sniffing
something by the old bear cage.

309
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:55,998
- Want to take a walk over?
Yeah.

310
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,334
Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, go ahead.

311
00:28:58,502 --> 00:29:00,836
We got a guy on Sydney
says he's the father.

312
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:02,463
Oh, shit.

313
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:05,174
- Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
- En route.

314
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:08,219
Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

315
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:11,889
Asking for you. Says he knows you.
Not taking no for an answer.

316
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:13,808
And he's got some guys with him.

317
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:17,269
- What guys?
- Crazy-looking guys.

318
00:29:17,437 --> 00:29:21,941
- The Savage brothers.
- Just a "hi" around the neighborhood?

319
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:23,943
All right, I'm on my way.

320
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:30,408
Hey, guys.
That's our niece in there.

321
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:32,244
Let us in.
We're doing our job.

322
00:29:32,411 --> 00:29:33,703
Let us in.
Fuck you!

323
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:35,580
The doughnut shop's that way!

324
00:29:35,748 --> 00:29:38,542
- Nick, Val, ease up.
- Fucking dickhead.

325
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,752
- Enough.
- Nick.

326
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,090
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

327
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,843
- Kevin, let's go.
- And, guys?

328
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:51,637
These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

329
00:29:51,805 --> 00:29:53,931
- But get answers.
- You got it.

330
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,313
Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.

331
00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:05,484
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

332
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:08,279
- Is she in there?
All we're doing is looking.

333
00:30:08,446 --> 00:30:12,075
- Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
- That's my daughter's car.

334
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:15,328
- I understand.
- And it's got blood in it.

335
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:19,791
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

336
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:24,629
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

337
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:27,048
Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, say again.

338
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:30,176
Sergeant Powers says you need
to get in here ASAP.

339
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:34,139
- Your location?
- The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.

340
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:36,141
All right.

341
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:38,310
Make sure he doesn't get through.

342
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:40,937
You got those bolt cutters in your car?

343
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:45,066
I'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

344
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:47,027
Go.

345
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:54,910
There's a massive search underway
for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.

346
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,746
All we know now
is there are signs of foul play...

347
00:30:57,914 --> 00:31:00,833
...in a car found abandoned
outside of Pen Park.

348
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:05,338
Now, police officers have moved in
quickly and cordoned off the area...

349
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:08,841
...but even as we speak,
a crowd of spectators has gathered.

350
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:12,303
We don't know more than that,
but we will stay on the story.

351
00:31:12,512 --> 00:31:17,850
Until later, this is Jim Smith
reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.

352
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,728
Ready? Bat back.

353
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,608
All the way back.

354
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:39,330
I never saw anything like that before.

355
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,874
What do we got?

356
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:53,553
Oh, Christ.

357
00:32:12,782 --> 00:32:14,533
Is that her?

358
00:32:17,537 --> 00:32:18,787
Yeah.

359
00:32:19,956 --> 00:32:23,041
We'll have the father
do a positive ID at the morgue.

360
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:25,627
Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

361
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:28,672
She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

362
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,261
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a. 38.

363
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:36,931
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

364
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:39,142
"Hey, Jimmy...

365
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:43,312
...God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect. "

366
00:32:46,942 --> 00:32:48,443
Hey.
Hold on!

367
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,905
Grab him. Stop that guy.
Hey, you!

368
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:55,324
I'm fucking going in there!
Take it easy!

369
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:57,827
Get his arms.
Hold him. Come on.

370
00:32:57,995 --> 00:33:00,329
Let me in, you motherfuckers!
Take it easy.

371
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:05,418
Let me in!
Is she in there?!

372
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:10,465
- Sean, is my daughter in there?!
- Let me in! You motherfuckers!

373
00:33:10,632 --> 00:33:14,135
Is my daughter in there?!
Is she in there?! Is she in there?!

374
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:16,512
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

375
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,142
Is my daughter in there?! Motherfuckers!

376
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,312
Is that my daughter in there?!

377
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,648
Look into my eyes! Is she in there?!

378
00:33:26,816 --> 00:33:31,361
Get off me!
- Sean, is that my daughter in there?!

379
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:34,323
Is that my daughter in there?

380
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:37,868
No! No!

381
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,165
Oh, no!

382
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,834
No, God!

383
00:33:46,002 --> 00:33:49,421
Oh, God, no!

384
00:34:33,217 --> 00:34:35,885
No one's said anything, right?

385
00:34:36,053 --> 00:34:37,720
What do you mean?

386
00:34:37,888 --> 00:34:42,433
You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?

387
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:44,561
Jimmy?

388
00:34:44,728 --> 00:34:46,354
- Jimmy, please...
- Please what?

389
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:50,233
- Please...
- Please what, baby? Please what?

390
00:35:30,316 --> 00:35:32,859
Yeah, that's her.

391
00:35:34,445 --> 00:35:36,404
That's Katie.

392
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:39,991
That's my daughter.

393
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,097
Fresh-brewed.

394
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:04,725
So we need to work a time line.

395
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:07,228
It's details, little things
that make a case.

396
00:36:07,395 --> 00:36:11,148
You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

397
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:17,071
Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

398
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:20,157
I heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

399
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:23,410
At the last minute,
she changed her mind.

400
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:26,789
See what I mean?

401
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:29,501
What do you mean, Jimmy?

402
00:36:31,462 --> 00:36:35,173
What if you or I had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

403
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:37,217
- What car?
- You're losing me here.

404
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:39,678
If I'd gotten into that car that day...

405
00:36:40,263 --> 00:36:42,681
...my life would have been
a different thing.

406
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,685
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...

407
00:36:47,478 --> 00:36:49,813
...she was a beautiful woman.

408
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:52,232
Regal.

409
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:55,652
As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

410
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,321
You had to have balls
to go near her, and I did.

411
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:02,659
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

412
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:05,578
Now, here's the thing, Sean.

413
00:37:05,746 --> 00:37:08,540
If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.

414
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:11,751
I never would have had the juice
to go near her.

415
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:15,089
And Katie never would have been born.

416
00:37:15,257 --> 00:37:18,384
And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

417
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:22,555
See?
- Yeah.

418
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:28,686
- You ever see Dave around?
- He married my cousin Celeste.

419
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:35,651
What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

420
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:37,320
Around 7:30.

421
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:40,448
Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

422
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:47,246
No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

423
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:50,458
She was having dinner with her friends.

424
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:56,922
Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
- Yeah.

425
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,926
She talked to Nadine
about her Communion...

426
00:38:01,094 --> 00:38:04,598
...and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

427
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:07,142
And then around 8, she left.

428
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,437
Do you know who she talked to?
- No.

429
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:14,358
Do you mind if we have the phone
company subpoenaed for records?

430
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,777
- No, go ahead.
Good.

431
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:21,323
You spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

432
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:24,576
Yes and no. I was mostly in back.

433
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:27,788
Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

434
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:31,208
No, she was herself,
she was happy. She...

435
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,168
She what?

436
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:36,463
It's nothing.

437
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,800
Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

438
00:38:40,593 --> 00:38:44,054
It's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died...

439
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,891
...I had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

440
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,312
Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter...

441
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,691
...but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

442
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:59,821
For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

443
00:38:59,988 --> 00:39:02,657
Okay.
- It was just a look.

444
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,037
It's information. We collect it, put it
together, see what fits. Little things.

445
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:09,497
You were in prison?

446
00:39:09,665 --> 00:39:10,957
- Oh, Jesus.
Here we go.

447
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:13,459
- Whitey.
- I'm just asking.

448
00:39:14,002 --> 00:39:17,839
Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer Island.

449
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:20,842
Is that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

450
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:24,846
Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.

451
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:28,307
- Sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

452
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:30,768
Okay, Mr. Markum.

453
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:34,439
- Okay.
- Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...

454
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:39,069
...outside of the look Katie gave you,
was there anything else?

455
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:48,454
There was this kid.

456
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:51,081
What am I talking about?
That was this morning.

457
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:53,375
What? Remember, it's the little things.

458
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:57,963
This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

459
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:00,924
- Barely knew each other.
- Could they have been dating?

460
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:02,885
No.
- What makes you so sure?

461
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:05,596
Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

462
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:08,557
Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

463
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:12,019
No one right now, as far as we know.

464
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:15,272
- I mean, knew.
- I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.

465
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,734
We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

466
00:40:18,902 --> 00:40:23,530
All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

467
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:28,035
And if you think of anything...

468
00:40:28,203 --> 00:40:31,872
...anything at all, give us a call.

469
00:40:37,754 --> 00:40:40,172
He said you almost got into a car
when you were kids?

470
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,259
Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle
were playing in front of my house.

471
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:46,303
This car came up and took Dave away.

472
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:49,306
- Abduction?
- Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.

473
00:40:49,474 --> 00:40:53,727
Convinced Dave to get in the car,
kept him for four days before he escaped.

474
00:40:53,895 --> 00:40:55,729
- They catch these guys?
- One died.

475
00:40:55,897 --> 00:40:58,774
The other got busted,
went the noose route in his cell.

476
00:40:58,942 --> 00:41:02,945
Your pal Markum, the moment I laid
eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.

477
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:06,281
They never lose that tension,
it settles in their shoulders.

478
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:09,201
He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.

479
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,748
No, that's in his stomach.
The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.

480
00:41:18,837 --> 00:41:21,673
Cause of death: The gunshot wound
to the back of the head...

481
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,800
...not the trauma from the beating.

482
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,385
What else?

483
00:41:25,594 --> 00:41:28,137
Her and her friends were barhopping.

484
00:41:28,305 --> 00:41:31,349
We're interviewing anyone
who might have seen them.

485
00:41:31,517 --> 00:41:34,143
One other thing,
the backpack in her car...

486
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:37,313
...had pamphlets on Las Vegas
and a list of Vegas hotels.

487
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:39,774
It doesn't sound like much.

488
00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:42,151
What do you say, Devine?

489
00:41:43,862 --> 00:41:45,572
We'll get the guy, sir.

490
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,867
That's right. All right, let's do it.

491
00:41:54,665 --> 00:41:57,793
- That's the best you can come up with?
- It made him happy, didn't it?

492
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,798
This is Sean.

493
00:42:03,592 --> 00:42:06,969
- Hello?
- Is it Lauren?

494
00:42:09,723 --> 00:42:12,558
You're in Manhattan.
I can tell by the traffic sounds.

495
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,729
Is he with you?

496
00:42:23,278 --> 00:42:25,446
Is that the baby?

497
00:42:26,865 --> 00:42:28,991
Christ, Lauren, at least tell me her name.

498
00:42:38,835 --> 00:42:41,503
Yeah, nice talking to you too.

499
00:42:55,436 --> 00:42:57,062
Hey.

500
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:02,859
Would it surprise you?

501
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:04,944
Wouldn't be the first time.

502
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,076
Did you see that girl?
Did you see that...?

503
00:43:11,243 --> 00:43:13,244
Did you see her?

504
00:43:13,704 --> 00:43:16,748
- I heard a car hit something.
- Hit what? Another car?

505
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:19,793
- Oh, no, not loud like that.
- Like hitting the curb?

506
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,836
Yes, maybe.

507
00:43:22,004 --> 00:43:24,964
Then it stalled, and someone said, "Hi. "

508
00:43:25,132 --> 00:43:27,258
- Someone said, "Hi"?
- "Hi. "

509
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:30,930
Then there was a loud crack.

510
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:34,809
- Could it have been a gunshot?
- Yes, maybe.

511
00:43:34,976 --> 00:43:38,354
- Did you look out your window?
Oh, no.

512
00:43:38,522 --> 00:43:41,482
I was in my dressing gown by then.

513
00:43:42,275 --> 00:43:45,111
I don't look out the window
in my dressing gown.

514
00:43:45,278 --> 00:43:47,947
The voice you heard,
was that a male or a female?

515
00:43:48,448 --> 00:43:50,574
Female.

516
00:43:50,742 --> 00:43:52,118
I think.

517
00:43:52,953 --> 00:43:56,038
- It sounds like the girl knew the shooter.
- Yeah.

518
00:43:56,206 --> 00:43:58,457
Sorry to trouble you.

519
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:08,926
- Jimmy.
- Theo.

520
00:44:09,094 --> 00:44:11,429
How's my daughter?
How's Annabeth holding up?

521
00:44:11,596 --> 00:44:13,597
- She's trying.
- Let's get these on ice.

522
00:44:13,765 --> 00:44:16,142
You got a couple of coolers?

523
00:44:22,108 --> 00:44:24,317
Right here's fine.

524
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,868
So how are you handling all this so far?

525
00:44:33,035 --> 00:44:35,996
- It hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
- Yeah?

526
00:44:36,164 --> 00:44:38,582
It's gonna hurt like hell when it does.

527
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,502
When my Janey died,
I was no good for six months...

528
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,465
...but my kids were
all grown up. I had that luxury.

529
00:44:46,632 --> 00:44:50,343
You, you got domestic responsibilities.

530
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,347
Domestic responsibilities?

531
00:44:54,515 --> 00:44:59,811
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls. That's your first priority.

532
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:02,981
Oh, you figured that might
have slipped my mind?

533
00:45:03,149 --> 00:45:05,735
It just needed to be said, that's all.

534
00:45:06,862 --> 00:45:09,989
You'll come through
because you're a man.

535
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:12,325
Like I said to Annabeth,
your wedding day.

536
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:15,745
I said, "You got yourself
a real old-school man there. "

537
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,539
- Like they put her in a bag.
What?

538
00:45:18,707 --> 00:45:21,918
That's what Katie looked like
when I saw her in the morgue.

539
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:26,047
Like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes.

540
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:29,884
- Well...
- Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.

541
00:45:30,052 --> 00:45:33,221
She went to sleep,
she never woke up. Peaceful.

542
00:45:33,555 --> 00:45:38,266
- You don't need to talk about Janey.
- My daughter was murdered.

543
00:45:38,434 --> 00:45:42,103
They put a gun to her. As we
stand here, she's on an autopsy slab...

544
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,065
...getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders...

545
00:45:45,233 --> 00:45:48,902
...and you're talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility?

546
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:54,951
Good to see you, Theo.

547
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:02,583
Eve, just tell them what they
want to know.

548
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,711
Who was she dating?
- We already told the Savages.

549
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:08,631
The Savage brothers?
- They were here yesterday.

550
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:12,176
Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?

551
00:46:12,344 --> 00:46:14,637
No one special.

552
00:46:18,016 --> 00:46:21,269
You guys were having
a goodbye dinner, right?

553
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,397
- What?
- She was leaving town, wasn't she?

554
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:27,942
- Going to Las Vegas?
- How do you know?

555
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:32,947
She closed her bank account,
she had hotel phone numbers.

556
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:37,118
She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.

557
00:46:37,452 --> 00:46:40,789
Well, a 19-year-old girl
doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.

558
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:43,834
So who was she going with?

559
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:48,088
Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?

560
00:46:48,965 --> 00:46:50,257
Brendan.

561
00:46:50,592 --> 00:46:52,634
Excuse me?

562
00:46:52,802 --> 00:46:56,179
- Brendan.
- Brendan Harris?

563
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,807
Brendan Harris, yeah.

564
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:00,809
You got an address?

565
00:47:14,324 --> 00:47:16,283
Hey, Dave.

566
00:47:20,163 --> 00:47:22,080
Hey, Jimmy.

567
00:47:22,248 --> 00:47:25,710
Sorry, I came out for a smoke.

568
00:47:26,545 --> 00:47:29,422
Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.

569
00:47:35,012 --> 00:47:38,014
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all day.

570
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:43,186
How you doing?

571
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,606
What happened to your hand?

572
00:47:47,524 --> 00:47:49,108
This?

573
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:54,364
I was helping a buddy move a couch.
I slammed it in the doorjamb.

574
00:47:55,532 --> 00:47:58,201
Ways you can manage
to hurt yourself, right?

575
00:48:00,537 --> 00:48:02,205
It's good to see you.

576
00:48:02,998 --> 00:48:04,332
Yeah?

577
00:48:10,381 --> 00:48:12,549
How are our girls holding up?

578
00:48:12,717 --> 00:48:14,843
They're doing okay, I guess.

579
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:18,347
That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

580
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:34,029
It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

581
00:48:36,324 --> 00:48:37,616
Yeah.

582
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,583
I couldn't stand looking through the
fridge to find room for all that food...

583
00:48:46,751 --> 00:48:49,712
...we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

584
00:48:50,005 --> 00:48:53,215
- Lot of waste, huh?
- Yeah.

585
00:48:54,592 --> 00:48:58,846
I just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

586
00:48:59,432 --> 00:49:03,935
Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

587
00:49:10,192 --> 00:49:13,611
One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little...

588
00:49:14,822 --> 00:49:16,906
...that girl was neat.

589
00:49:20,244 --> 00:49:21,828
When I got out of the joint...

590
00:49:23,205 --> 00:49:26,124
...you know, after Marita died...

591
00:49:27,626 --> 00:49:32,630
...I remember, I was more afraid
of my little daughter...

592
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:36,468
...than I ever was of being in prison.

593
00:49:44,935 --> 00:49:47,146
I loved her...

594
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,357
...most...

595
00:49:53,028 --> 00:49:56,530
...because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night...

596
00:49:59,409 --> 00:50:05,539
...it was like we were the last two
people on Earth. You know, forgotten.

597
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:08,334
Unwanted.

598
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,799
And it's really starting to piss me off,
Dave, because I can't cry for her.

599
00:50:14,966 --> 00:50:19,053
My own little daughter,
and I can't even cry for her.

600
00:50:24,017 --> 00:50:25,810
Jimmy.

601
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,816
You're crying now.

602
00:50:35,029 --> 00:50:37,197
Yeah, damn.

603
00:50:42,245 --> 00:50:45,205
I just want to hug her one more time.

604
00:50:48,918 --> 00:50:52,629
She was 19 fucking years old.

605
00:50:59,928 --> 00:51:01,887
Do you want me to leave you alone?

606
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:05,432
No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

607
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:10,229
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

608
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:29,875
When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

609
00:51:30,168 --> 00:51:33,628
- You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
- She isn't hurt. She's dead.

610
00:51:36,924 --> 00:51:40,594
- I didn't kill her.
- Again, when's the last time you saw her?

611
00:51:42,805 --> 00:51:46,099
About 8...
Saturday night, about 8:00.

612
00:51:46,392 --> 00:51:48,393
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

613
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:50,937
It was about 8. Um...

614
00:51:51,939 --> 00:51:56,943
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

615
00:51:57,278 --> 00:52:00,614
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

616
00:52:02,158 --> 00:52:03,825
I don't know.

617
00:52:04,744 --> 00:52:09,457
But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

618
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:13,544
What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

619
00:52:13,712 --> 00:52:15,213
He's not a thief.

620
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,007
He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

621
00:52:18,592 --> 00:52:22,345
Daughter probably had the same bad
gene. You count yourself lucky, Bren.

622
00:52:23,096 --> 00:52:27,642
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

623
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,812
We were gonna leave Sunday.

624
00:52:33,023 --> 00:52:35,942
We were gonna get married
when we got there.

625
00:52:38,153 --> 00:52:40,529
Well, that was the plan, right?

626
00:52:40,822 --> 00:52:43,699
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

627
00:52:43,867 --> 00:52:46,994
- Ma, I was gonna tell you.
- Just like your father, huh?

628
00:52:54,002 --> 00:52:58,173
That's my brother, Ray,
and his friend John.

629
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,717
Hey, boys.
Hey.

630
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,678
He don't speak.

631
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:07,182
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

632
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,478
They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

633
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:16,984
So where were you between 12:30
and 2 a. m. On Sunday morning, Brendan?

634
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,069
I was asleep.

635
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,029
Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

636
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,995
I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

637
00:53:28,162 --> 00:53:30,956
He came down for breakfast at 9.

638
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:36,420
I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

639
00:53:36,587 --> 00:53:40,757
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take a
polygraph. You think you're up for that?

640
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,972
I loved her so much.

641
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,768
I'm never gonna feel that again.

642
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,730
It doesn't happen twice.

643
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,192
Doesn't happen once most times.

644
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,571
Celeste.

645
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:06,743
- Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
- What are you still doing here?

646
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,911
Uh...

647
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,205
I don't know.

648
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:15,001
I don't know, I just...

649
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,046
Did Annabeth get to sleep?

650
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,923
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.

651
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,093
- Could I get one of those?
- Yeah.

652
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,727
One for the road and then home.

653
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:40,778
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

654
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,780
You've done enough.

655
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,286
To you and Dave for being here for this.

656
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:09,807
Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.

657
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:14,061
I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

658
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:15,897
Good night.

659
00:55:16,857 --> 00:55:19,484
Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

660
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:40,588
Hello?

661
00:55:43,175 --> 00:55:47,387
Oh, Christ. Lauren, say something.

662
00:55:53,561 --> 00:55:56,354
"Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?"

663
00:55:57,064 --> 00:56:00,817
Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing
things made sense.

664
00:56:00,985 --> 00:56:03,237
I'm tired of caring about
some dead girl...

665
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:06,157
...and there's just gonna be
another one after her.

666
00:56:07,325 --> 00:56:11,786
Sending killers to jail is sending them
where they've been heading all their lives.

667
00:56:11,954 --> 00:56:13,997
The dead are still dead.

668
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,960
Jesus, I...

669
00:56:19,128 --> 00:56:21,254
...can't do this tonight.

670
00:56:21,547 --> 00:56:23,339
I just...

671
00:56:24,383 --> 00:56:26,176
I can't do it.

672
00:56:26,552 --> 00:56:28,344
Bye, baby.

673
00:56:39,023 --> 00:56:40,648
Because...

674
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:45,278
...sometimes the man
wasn't a man at all.

675
00:56:45,488 --> 00:56:47,197
He was the boy.

676
00:56:48,115 --> 00:56:51,160
The boy who escaped from wolves.

677
00:56:52,245 --> 00:56:54,830
An animal of the dusk.

678
00:56:55,123 --> 00:56:56,999
Invisible.

679
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:59,293
Silent.

680
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,962
Living in a world...

681
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,548
...the others never saw.

682
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:08,928
World of fireflies.

683
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:14,975
Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

684
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:20,105
Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

685
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:36,498
I just gotta get my head right.

686
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,671
Catch a nice, long sleep.

687
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:46,132
And the boy will go back to his forest.

688
00:57:48,219 --> 00:57:51,304
Back to his fireflies.

689
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:00,313
Is he asleep?

690
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:24,338
How's Jimmy and everybody?

691
00:58:25,424 --> 00:58:27,133
Okay.

692
00:58:27,426 --> 00:58:29,176
It's weird.

693
00:58:29,636 --> 00:58:33,556
Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

694
00:58:33,724 --> 00:58:36,183
Dave? Dave.

695
00:58:39,438 --> 00:58:41,397
There's still nothing in the paper.

696
00:58:42,024 --> 00:58:45,985
About what?

697
00:58:48,697 --> 00:58:52,950
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
hurt him as bad as I thought.

698
00:58:53,368 --> 00:58:55,995
He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

699
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:00,708
Yeah.

700
00:59:00,876 --> 00:59:02,418
Right.

701
00:59:04,755 --> 00:59:07,340
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

702
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:10,719
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.

703
00:59:11,888 --> 00:59:14,598
That seems more important right now.

704
00:59:43,753 --> 00:59:47,589
I know in my soul I contributed
to your death.

705
00:59:48,591 --> 00:59:51,093
But I don't know how.

706
01:00:10,948 --> 01:00:12,782
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

707
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,618
Good. I didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

708
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:17,120
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

709
01:00:17,287 --> 01:00:21,290
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

710
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:24,127
All people who, I'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

711
01:00:24,294 --> 01:00:27,046
Considering the crime, maybe.

712
01:00:27,297 --> 01:00:28,631
Dave Boyle?

713
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,260
Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

714
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,970
Could be.

715
01:00:34,138 --> 01:00:37,640
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

716
01:00:37,808 --> 01:00:41,519
- Clam up for no reason, huh?
- We'll see.

717
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:54,408
Hey, Boyle!

718
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,536
- What's it been, seven, eight years?
- Yeah.

719
01:00:57,704 --> 01:00:59,204
Yeah. How you doing?

720
01:00:59,497 --> 01:01:00,831
This is my son, Michael.

721
01:01:00,999 --> 01:01:03,375
Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.

722
01:01:03,543 --> 01:01:04,877
I'm an old buddy of your dad's.

723
01:01:05,044 --> 01:01:06,420
- Hi.
Hi.

724
01:01:07,088 --> 01:01:10,340
- So you still with the staties?
- Homicide. This is my partner.

725
01:01:10,508 --> 01:01:13,218
- Sergeant Powers. How are you?
So you got a minute?

726
01:01:13,386 --> 01:01:17,681
- We'd love to ask some quick questions.
- I was gonna walk Michael to school.

727
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:21,769
- I can be back in a few minutes.
We'll walk with you, okay?

728
01:01:21,936 --> 01:01:23,437
Sure.

729
01:01:25,023 --> 01:01:26,814
So you look good.

730
01:01:27,357 --> 01:01:30,359
- I hear rents are rising.
Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

731
01:01:30,527 --> 01:01:33,155
They're cutting my dad's
old house up into condos.

732
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:35,115
We walked by there the other day.

733
01:01:35,283 --> 01:01:37,534
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

734
01:01:37,702 --> 01:01:40,120
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

735
01:01:40,288 --> 01:01:42,414
"Neighborhood needs
a fucking crime wave.

736
01:01:42,582 --> 01:01:44,750
Get property values where they belong. "

737
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:49,421
Girls keep getting murdered up in
Pen Park you might get your wish.

738
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:52,090
Dave. Call me Dave.

739
01:01:52,258 --> 01:01:54,218
You said the F-word, Dad.

740
01:01:54,594 --> 01:01:57,387
Yeah, I know.
Walk on up ahead, Michael.

741
01:01:57,555 --> 01:02:00,724
Us guys need to talk. Go on.

742
01:02:00,892 --> 01:02:04,895
- So, what's up, Sean?
- Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

743
01:02:05,063 --> 01:02:07,981
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

744
01:02:08,149 --> 01:02:10,275
- Who's Celeste?
- My wife.

745
01:02:10,443 --> 01:02:14,696
- How's Jimmy doing?
- It's hard to tell. You know him.

746
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:18,243
- Yeah, so the reason we came by...
- Listen, I saw her.

747
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:23,456
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

748
01:02:23,624 --> 01:02:25,625
That's what we wanted to talk about.

749
01:02:25,793 --> 01:02:29,754
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

750
01:02:29,922 --> 01:02:32,215
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

751
01:02:32,383 --> 01:02:35,927
- Pretty drunk, huh?
- But it was harmless.

752
01:02:36,095 --> 01:02:39,138
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

753
01:02:39,306 --> 01:02:40,890
What time did they leave?

754
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:44,102
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

755
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,397
- So we'll say 12:45?
- Sounds about right.

756
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,067
You see anything unusual
or anyone...?

757
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:52,902
Michael.

758
01:02:53,404 --> 01:02:55,113
Like what?
I don't know.

759
01:02:55,281 --> 01:02:56,614
A guy watching the girls?

760
01:02:56,782 --> 01:02:59,617
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

761
01:03:00,953 --> 01:03:05,624
No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

762
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:07,167
See you later, Dad.

763
01:03:07,335 --> 01:03:09,128
You got your milk money?

764
01:03:16,136 --> 01:03:18,137
Fuck, I hated school.

765
01:03:18,638 --> 01:03:20,180
What?

766
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:21,432
Oh, uh...

767
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,685
Yeah, me too, Sean.

768
01:03:24,895 --> 01:03:30,357
Uh, just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

769
01:03:30,525 --> 01:03:33,652
- Home.
- Home by 1: 15, would you say?

770
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,614
- Roughly. Sure.
- All right.

771
01:03:38,325 --> 01:03:41,368
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

772
01:03:41,828 --> 01:03:44,997
- Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
All right.

773
01:03:51,671 --> 01:03:53,256
What?

774
01:03:53,633 --> 01:03:56,009
What happened to him in that car?

775
01:04:03,351 --> 01:04:05,185
Can you believe this?

776
01:04:05,353 --> 01:04:08,355
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

777
01:04:08,522 --> 01:04:10,315
Yeah, well...

778
01:04:10,942 --> 01:04:14,402
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

779
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:16,488
...you're not left with a whole lot.

780
01:04:16,656 --> 01:04:19,240
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

781
01:04:19,408 --> 01:04:23,620
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

782
01:04:23,788 --> 01:04:25,747
Hears a gunshot,
before that a "hi"...

783
01:04:25,915 --> 01:04:29,167
...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

784
01:04:29,335 --> 01:04:33,964
She turns to the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

785
01:04:34,131 --> 01:04:38,009
- She says, "Hi. " He shoots her.
- She slams the door into him, takes off.

786
01:04:38,177 --> 01:04:40,846
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

787
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:43,641
- I don't know. Something in the street.
- Maybe.

788
01:04:43,809 --> 01:04:47,061
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

789
01:04:47,229 --> 01:04:51,524
- Hits hard enough to get a jump on him?
- Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

790
01:04:51,692 --> 01:04:55,236
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

791
01:04:55,404 --> 01:04:58,614
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second, how
did we get to Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

792
01:04:58,782 --> 01:05:01,492
We just got to him.
- He's a guy who was in the bar.

793
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,495
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

794
01:05:04,663 --> 01:05:06,789
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

795
01:05:06,957 --> 01:05:10,626
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

796
01:05:10,794 --> 01:05:12,962
Just a little one.

797
01:05:17,968 --> 01:05:22,221
I'd recommend two sets of
visiting hours, from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

798
01:05:22,389 --> 01:05:24,557
- Sure.
- Good.

799
01:05:26,102 --> 01:05:30,897
- Have you thought about flowers?
- I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

800
01:05:31,232 --> 01:05:32,566
Good.

801
01:05:37,947 --> 01:05:39,865
And the notice?

802
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,075
Notice?

803
01:05:43,453 --> 01:05:48,331
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

804
01:05:48,499 --> 01:05:51,084
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

805
01:05:51,252 --> 01:05:52,961
Where's my daughter?

806
01:05:55,465 --> 01:05:57,507
Downstairs, in the basement.

807
01:05:58,342 --> 01:05:59,634
I wanna see her.

808
01:06:47,016 --> 01:06:49,351
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

809
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,855
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

810
01:06:54,232 --> 01:06:56,858
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

811
01:07:00,781 --> 01:07:03,366
Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

812
01:07:06,829 --> 01:07:08,746
The notice.

813
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,416
It should read: "Katherine Markum...

814
01:07:14,086 --> 01:07:17,588
...beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased...

815
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:22,593
...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to... "

816
01:07:22,928 --> 01:07:26,389
"Sister to Sara and Nadine. "

817
01:08:06,764 --> 01:08:10,809
You guys again?
- Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.

818
01:08:11,769 --> 01:08:14,062
- You dropping in on Jimmy?
- Yeah.

819
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:16,982
Do you have some kind of, what,
break in the case?

820
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:20,152
No, just paying our respects.
Where you off to?

821
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,946
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes.

822
01:08:23,156 --> 01:08:24,948
I'm gonna go get some.
See you in a minute.

823
01:08:25,116 --> 01:08:28,952
By the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened
to your hand there?

824
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:35,418
Uh, garbage disposal. It jammed,
I stuck my hand in, it started again.

825
01:08:35,586 --> 01:08:37,295
- Stupid.
Yeah, painful.

826
01:08:41,634 --> 01:08:43,968
Garbage disposal. Bullshit.

827
01:08:44,136 --> 01:08:48,139
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
he killed anybody either. Come on.

828
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:04,781
- Heard you could use one.
- Thanks.

829
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:10,495
- I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?
- Whatever you need right now.

830
01:09:12,206 --> 01:09:14,207
Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.

831
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:22,549
I got a couple errands I gotta run.
I'll be back in an hour.

832
01:09:22,717 --> 01:09:25,386
You don't have to come back, Celeste.
I'll be fine.

833
01:09:25,553 --> 01:09:26,720
Sure?
- Celeste Boyle?

834
01:09:26,888 --> 01:09:28,347
Uh, yeah.

835
01:09:28,515 --> 01:09:31,934
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.

836
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:35,145
- Mrs. Boyle.
- Nice to meet you.

837
01:09:35,313 --> 01:09:36,814
Look, I gotta go.

838
01:09:39,693 --> 01:09:41,485
- Oh, damn it.
What?

839
01:09:41,653 --> 01:09:43,404
I left my report pad in the cruiser.

840
01:09:43,571 --> 01:09:46,156
- You better go get it.
- Yeah.

841
01:09:46,992 --> 01:09:48,450
Come on.

842
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,042
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you
a quick question?

843
01:09:57,585 --> 01:10:00,004
- Me?
- What time did Dave get home Saturday?

844
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:01,797
- What?
- It's a little thing.

845
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:05,718
We're running a time line on everything
involving Katie. I'm sure...

846
01:10:05,885 --> 01:10:07,928
...Dave told you he saw her
at McGill's.

847
01:10:09,515 --> 01:10:11,683
You think Dave killed Katie?

848
01:10:12,143 --> 01:10:15,395
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?

849
01:10:17,815 --> 01:10:21,234
- I don't know.
- No. It's just that we could figure out...

850
01:10:21,402 --> 01:10:24,988
...what time she was on the road
if we knew what time Dave got home.

851
01:10:25,156 --> 01:10:28,325
See, it's 5 minutes from your place
to McGill's...

852
01:10:28,492 --> 01:10:31,953
...and Katie left 15 minutes
before Dave did. You see what I mean.

853
01:10:32,413 --> 01:10:35,457
I was asleep.

854
01:10:36,584 --> 01:10:41,796
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.

855
01:10:41,964 --> 01:10:44,299
Okay. Well, thanks.

856
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,771
Bullshit.

857
01:10:56,938 --> 01:10:58,439
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.

858
01:10:58,607 --> 01:11:02,276
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.

859
01:11:02,444 --> 01:11:04,153
Brendan Harris confirmed it.

860
01:11:04,696 --> 01:11:05,946
Remember what you said?

861
01:11:06,448 --> 01:11:10,951
How she looked at you on Saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again?

862
01:11:12,579 --> 01:11:16,415
- Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
- No.

863
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:18,167
You're 100 percent sure?

864
01:11:18,835 --> 01:11:23,130
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her.

865
01:11:26,134 --> 01:11:29,053
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.

866
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:31,639
Why are you so dead set
against that kid?

867
01:11:31,807 --> 01:11:35,476
He said Katie told him you'd disown
her if she ever dated a Harris.

868
01:11:37,145 --> 01:11:40,314
I knew his father. They called him
"Just Ray" Harris.

869
01:11:40,482 --> 01:11:41,816
Why is that?

870
01:11:43,861 --> 01:11:46,488
There were so many Rays
in the neighborhood.

871
01:11:46,656 --> 01:11:50,826
You had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck,
"Psycho Ray" Dorian.

872
01:11:51,828 --> 01:11:54,996
The cool names were taken,
so he got stuck with "Just Ray. "

873
01:11:55,164 --> 01:11:57,999
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.

874
01:11:58,835 --> 01:12:03,671
And he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers.

875
01:12:04,089 --> 01:12:05,840
I don't know.

876
01:12:06,174 --> 01:12:09,009
I just figure the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

877
01:12:09,302 --> 01:12:14,348
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris
dating Katie or any daughter of mine.

878
01:12:16,518 --> 01:12:19,311
I can't believe we're talking about
Just Ray Harris.

879
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:22,022
How about this? We've interviewed
witnesses...

880
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:24,358
...canvassed people
who were in the bar.

881
01:12:24,526 --> 01:12:28,529
We've run into more than a few of them
who were questioned...

882
01:12:28,697 --> 01:12:32,200
...before us by one or more
of the Savage brothers.

883
01:12:32,368 --> 01:12:35,662
- So?
- So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.

884
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:39,583
- Some people don't talk to policemen.
- With all due respect...

885
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,252
...and just so we're clear,
this is our case.

886
01:12:43,004 --> 01:12:45,422
- How long?
- How long what?

887
01:12:45,756 --> 01:12:48,216
How long before you catch
my daughter's killer?

888
01:12:48,384 --> 01:12:49,718
You bargaining with us?

889
01:12:51,554 --> 01:12:52,846
Bargaining?

890
01:12:54,557 --> 01:12:56,391
You giving us a deadline?

891
01:12:59,395 --> 01:13:03,231
We'll speak for Katie, Mr. Markum.
If that's okay with you.

892
01:13:04,484 --> 01:13:08,987
Just find my daughter's killer, sergeant.
I'm not standing in your way.

893
01:13:12,783 --> 01:13:16,746
The last thing we need is Markum and
the Savages putting the fear of God...

894
01:13:16,914 --> 01:13:19,957
...into the neighborhood.
- We grew up terrified of those brothers.

895
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:23,753
Eleven months apart, like their mother
ran a loose-cannon factory.

896
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:26,380
Fucking knuckleheads.

897
01:13:29,426 --> 01:13:31,511
Ballistics are in on the Markum murder.

898
01:13:31,678 --> 01:13:35,056
- Yeah, you got a match?
- Mm-hm. You're gonna love it.

899
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:39,602
It's a perfect match.
Gun was a. 38 Smith.

900
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:44,065
Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer
in New Hampshire in 1982.

901
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:49,362
The gun that killed Katherine Markum
was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.

902
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:50,905
- In Buckingham.
- The Flats?

903
01:13:51,073 --> 01:13:55,701
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
I pulled the file.

904
01:13:55,869 --> 01:13:59,956
It was a two-man job.
They fired a warning shot into a wall.

905
01:14:00,123 --> 01:14:03,752
- That's where the bullet got pulled.
- Nice work.

906
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,088
Thought you'd like that.

907
01:14:35,785 --> 01:14:37,703
It's okay, Ray.

908
01:14:38,496 --> 01:14:40,330
Don't worry about it.

909
01:14:54,346 --> 01:14:55,680
Ma said that?

910
01:14:58,267 --> 01:14:59,517
That I'm better off?

911
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:08,359
I loved her! You know what that's like?

912
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,035
I'm sorry.

913
01:15:25,127 --> 01:15:26,961
No, you're wrong.

914
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:30,381
I won't ever feel that again.

915
01:15:31,175 --> 01:15:36,346
Right there. Went in through a bottle
of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.

916
01:15:36,513 --> 01:15:40,392
Scary, huh?
- Scarier than a glass of milk, right?

917
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,103
So take me through it.
These two guys come in...

918
01:15:43,313 --> 01:15:47,149
In rubber masks.
They came in through here.

919
01:15:49,486 --> 01:15:52,029
That's the storeroom.

920
01:15:53,031 --> 01:15:56,742
There's a door back there
that leads to a loading dock.

921
01:15:57,035 --> 01:15:59,244
I always keep that door locked.

922
01:15:59,954 --> 01:16:02,915
So they must have had a key.

923
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:07,086
A key? So, what you're saying
is that it was an inside job?

924
01:16:07,253 --> 01:16:11,548
It had to be. One of them, at least,
worked for me at some point.

925
01:16:11,716 --> 01:16:16,428
The only reason they fired that warning
shot was they must have known...

926
01:16:16,846 --> 01:16:18,597
...I kept this under the counter.

927
01:16:18,765 --> 01:16:22,393
- And you told the police that at the time.
- Yeah.

928
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:25,855
Sure, they went through
my employment records.

929
01:16:26,023 --> 01:16:28,608
Questioned everybody
who used to work for me.

930
01:16:28,776 --> 01:16:31,861
- Never made an arrest.
- Still have a copy of those records?

931
01:16:32,029 --> 01:16:36,950
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there.
But I know who did it.

932
01:16:37,118 --> 01:16:38,618
Oh, yeah?

933
01:16:38,786 --> 01:16:41,496
- This guy I fired a couple of weeks before.
Mm-hm.

934
01:16:41,664 --> 01:16:45,583
Son of a bitch came in here
a few days after the robbery.

935
01:16:45,751 --> 01:16:49,963
He had this fucking goddamn grin
on his face.

936
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:52,215
And I just knew.

937
01:16:52,383 --> 01:16:55,135
Go tell a grin to a jury, right?

938
01:16:55,803 --> 01:16:57,637
You remember his name?

939
01:16:58,639 --> 01:17:00,598
Do I look senile to you?

940
01:17:00,975 --> 01:17:03,268
- No, sir.
- Name...

941
01:17:03,477 --> 01:17:05,478
...was Ray Harris.

942
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:08,898
We used to call him "Just Ray. "

943
01:17:11,653 --> 01:17:14,697
You say they used the same gun
for another crime?

944
01:17:15,698 --> 01:17:19,409
- That's correct, sir.
- Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.

945
01:17:31,338 --> 01:17:33,214
Where you been?

946
01:17:34,508 --> 01:17:36,217
Out.

947
01:17:39,472 --> 01:17:41,473
What you watching?

948
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,725
Some vampire movie.

949
01:17:44,435 --> 01:17:47,020
Guy just got his head torn off.

950
01:17:48,773 --> 01:17:50,940
Where'd you go, Celeste?

951
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:57,530
I was sitting in my car...

952
01:17:57,991 --> 01:18:01,160
...down by the channel.
You know...

953
01:18:01,787 --> 01:18:03,204
...thinking about things.

954
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,417
- What'd you think about?
- Oh, you know...

955
01:18:08,835 --> 01:18:11,837
No, actually, I don't know.

956
01:18:17,552 --> 01:18:20,888
Things. You know, the day.

957
01:18:22,516 --> 01:18:25,351
About Katie being dead.

958
01:18:25,936 --> 01:18:28,771
And poor Annabeth and Jimmy,
you know...

959
01:18:29,481 --> 01:18:31,357
...those things.

960
01:18:31,733 --> 01:18:33,734
Those things.

961
01:18:34,528 --> 01:18:36,946
Know what I was thinking about, huh?

962
01:18:38,573 --> 01:18:40,115
Vampires.

963
01:18:41,827 --> 01:18:43,077
What about them?

964
01:18:44,956 --> 01:18:48,083
They're undead...

965
01:18:48,251 --> 01:18:51,336
...but I think maybe there's
something beautiful about it.

966
01:18:51,504 --> 01:18:55,048
Maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what it's like...

967
01:18:55,216 --> 01:18:57,092
...to be human.
Maybe then it's okay.

968
01:18:58,511 --> 01:19:00,762
What the fuck you talking about, Dave?

969
01:19:01,097 --> 01:19:03,473
Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.

970
01:19:03,641 --> 01:19:05,767
You're not making any sense.

971
01:19:08,813 --> 01:19:10,564
You think I killed Katie?

972
01:19:10,731 --> 01:19:12,858
- Celeste.
- What...?

973
01:19:13,067 --> 01:19:17,279
- That the sense we're making these days?
- Where'd you come up with that?

974
01:19:17,446 --> 01:19:20,824
You've barely looked at me since you
found out Katie was dead.

975
01:19:20,992 --> 01:19:22,742
In fact, you seem repulsed by me.

976
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:24,661
- Dave!
- What?

977
01:19:24,829 --> 01:19:29,583
I don't think anything.
I'm confused, okay?

978
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,543
Even your friend Sean
asked about...

979
01:19:31,711 --> 01:19:33,796
He's not my friend, if you didn't know.

980
01:19:33,964 --> 01:19:38,634
He asked me about you.
What time you came home.

981
01:19:39,303 --> 01:19:42,597
- What'd you tell him?
- I said I was asleep.

982
01:19:43,599 --> 01:19:46,726
- That's good thinking, baby.
- Jesus Christ, Dave!

983
01:19:46,894 --> 01:19:49,812
- Why not tell them about the mugger?
- The mugger?

984
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,607
The mugger! I see how
your mind's working. I do.

985
01:19:52,774 --> 01:19:55,985
I come home with blood on me
the same night Katie's murdered.

986
01:19:56,153 --> 01:19:57,820
I must have killed her, right?

987
01:19:58,238 --> 01:19:59,947
Fuck!

988
01:20:27,727 --> 01:20:29,227
Henry...

989
01:20:29,854 --> 01:20:32,356
What? Henry?

990
01:20:34,651 --> 01:20:37,110
Henry and George.

991
01:20:40,823 --> 01:20:43,033
I never told anyone that before.

992
01:20:44,911 --> 01:20:46,370
Those were their names.

993
01:20:47,956 --> 01:20:50,540
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

994
01:20:53,711 --> 01:20:56,713
At least that's what they called
themselves, but...

995
01:20:57,882 --> 01:21:01,426
...they were wolves, and Dave...

996
01:21:02,095 --> 01:21:06,140
...was the boy who escaped
from wolves.

997
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:10,520
What are you talking about, Dave?

998
01:21:11,063 --> 01:21:13,439
I'm talking Henry and George.

999
01:21:14,441 --> 01:21:17,235
They took me on a four-day ride.

1000
01:21:17,945 --> 01:21:23,282
They buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag.

1001
01:21:24,118 --> 01:21:27,036
And, man, Celeste...

1002
01:21:27,246 --> 01:21:28,955
...did they have their fun.

1003
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:34,293
And no one came to help old Dave then.

1004
01:21:36,296 --> 01:21:41,092
Dave had to pretend to be
somebody else.

1005
01:21:46,098 --> 01:21:48,725
You mean, all those years ago...

1006
01:21:51,603 --> 01:21:54,023
...when you were a little boy?

1007
01:21:55,692 --> 01:21:57,317
Dave...

1008
01:21:57,485 --> 01:21:59,570
Dave's dead.

1009
01:22:00,947 --> 01:22:05,075
I don't know who came out of that
cellar, but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!

1010
01:22:06,453 --> 01:22:07,870
You see, honey...

1011
01:22:08,038 --> 01:22:09,538
Fuck!

1012
01:22:09,789 --> 01:22:12,416
It's like vampires.

1013
01:22:15,462 --> 01:22:17,463
Once it's in you...

1014
01:22:18,882 --> 01:22:20,799
...it stays.

1015
01:22:22,177 --> 01:22:24,219
What stays?

1016
01:22:30,894 --> 01:22:34,103
Did you know there were
child prostitutes in Rome Basin?

1017
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,439
What?

1018
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:43,739
Fuck!

1019
01:22:46,993 --> 01:22:49,995
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.

1020
01:22:50,163 --> 01:22:52,164
I'm warning you...

1021
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,834
...I can't trust my mind.

1022
01:22:58,797 --> 01:23:02,216
I gotta go out,
try to get my head around it.

1023
01:23:04,552 --> 01:23:13,977
Okay.

1024
01:23:15,688 --> 01:23:19,566
- The gun sends us in a different direction.
- I don't see it that way.

1025
01:23:19,734 --> 01:23:22,319
What does Just Ray's gun
have to do with Dave?

1026
01:23:22,487 --> 01:23:24,279
These things get passed around.

1027
01:23:24,447 --> 01:23:27,408
Just Ray may have blown town,
but his gun never did.

1028
01:23:27,576 --> 01:23:30,495
I say we talk with Brendan Harris
in the morning.

1029
01:23:30,663 --> 01:23:34,749
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.

1030
01:23:34,917 --> 01:23:39,379
They're hiding something, but Boyle's
as much a killer as Brendan Harris.

1031
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:43,716
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...

1032
01:23:43,884 --> 01:23:48,054
...sexually abused as a kid. On paper,
this guy should be in jail already.

1033
01:23:48,222 --> 01:23:50,557
Katie Markum
was not sexually abused, see?

1034
01:23:50,724 --> 01:23:54,102
In that equation,
sexual emission is part of the deal.

1035
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:58,273
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.

1036
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,732
Hey, he's not my friend.

1037
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:04,404
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours.

1038
01:24:19,004 --> 01:24:20,629
Hey, Jimmy.

1039
01:24:21,882 --> 01:24:23,424
You're out late.

1040
01:24:23,592 --> 01:24:25,301
Yeah, you too.

1041
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:28,554
It's cold, huh?

1042
01:24:28,805 --> 01:24:31,056
Yeah, I guess.

1043
01:24:38,523 --> 01:24:40,107
You know, I...

1044
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:42,651
I been sitting out here...

1045
01:24:42,819 --> 01:24:44,945
...over the last few years...

1046
01:24:46,865 --> 01:24:50,951
...waiting on Katie to get back
from someplace.

1047
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:56,957
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
"I'm gonna sit on the porch for a while. "

1048
01:25:01,505 --> 01:25:03,340
Weird thing is...

1049
01:25:04,217 --> 01:25:06,301
...it seemed to bring her back.

1050
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:12,849
I saw her, you know.

1051
01:25:14,685 --> 01:25:16,353
Saw who?

1052
01:25:16,604 --> 01:25:19,689
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.

1053
01:25:21,692 --> 01:25:25,820
- You saw Katie Saturday night?
- Never got around to telling you.

1054
01:25:28,824 --> 01:25:30,492
Did you talk to her?

1055
01:25:31,327 --> 01:25:33,828
Just nodded hello at one point.

1056
01:25:34,664 --> 01:25:37,165
Next time I looked up, she was gone.

1057
01:25:43,381 --> 01:25:44,881
But, uh...

1058
01:25:45,049 --> 01:25:46,633
...Jimmy...

1059
01:25:48,095 --> 01:25:50,012
...she looked, um...

1060
01:25:51,348 --> 01:25:52,848
...happy.

1061
01:26:08,991 --> 01:26:13,035
Uh, I got more walking to do.
Good night.

1062
01:26:24,923 --> 01:26:28,175
- You stole his car.
- His car was officially towed.

1063
01:26:28,343 --> 01:26:32,179
From the front of his house.
- No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...

1064
01:26:32,347 --> 01:26:33,848
...adjacent to the parkway.

1065
01:26:34,016 --> 01:26:38,562
Lucky for us, the parkway's state
jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...

1066
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:42,316
...they took it for a joy ride...
- What? Why'd you do it?

1067
01:26:42,483 --> 01:26:47,404
After I left last night, I decided to talk
to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.

1068
01:26:47,572 --> 01:26:52,367
I get to his house, I decide to look in
his car, see what he's got. I find blood.

1069
01:26:52,535 --> 01:26:55,245
- Blood?
- Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.

1070
01:26:55,413 --> 01:26:59,249
- How much?
- A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot.

1071
01:26:59,417 --> 01:27:02,252
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.

1072
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:05,172
Wait, Katie Markum
never got in anybody's trunk.

1073
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:08,091
She was chased through the park
where she died.

1074
01:27:08,259 --> 01:27:12,095
- It's enough to ask questions.
- Your search is gonna get tossed out.

1075
01:27:12,263 --> 01:27:17,142
No, found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.

1076
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:21,438
- In the best interest of the owner.
- Get a physical search, file the report.

1077
01:27:21,606 --> 01:27:23,107
Bingo.

1078
01:27:23,776 --> 01:27:26,444
So, you wanna talk to him,
or should I send him home?

1079
01:27:26,779 --> 01:27:29,781
- Dave's here?
- I've had him in the box for an hour.

1080
01:27:29,948 --> 01:27:33,076
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers
to pick him up.

1081
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:36,120
Come on, Mr. Boyle!

1082
01:27:36,288 --> 01:27:39,499
We know you didn't get that swollen
hand sticking it in the garbage disposal.

1083
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:44,921
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Why's your wife afraid of you?

1084
01:27:45,464 --> 01:27:47,964
She know what really happened
to your hand?

1085
01:27:54,263 --> 01:27:57,140
How about a Sprite or something?

1086
01:27:57,308 --> 01:28:01,353
How about you tell us what really
happened Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?

1087
01:28:01,521 --> 01:28:03,063
You lied.

1088
01:28:03,231 --> 01:28:05,774
That's your opinion,
which you're entitled to.

1089
01:28:05,942 --> 01:28:10,822
- Hey, you think this is funny?
- No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.

1090
01:28:10,989 --> 01:28:15,451
Not only was my car stolen last night,
but now you won't release it to me.

1091
01:28:15,619 --> 01:28:17,203
Okay.

1092
01:28:18,705 --> 01:28:20,373
All right.

1093
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:24,001
Tell us, Mr. Boyle,
how did you get the blood in your car?

1094
01:28:24,169 --> 01:28:26,838
- What blood?
- Let's start with the front seat.

1095
01:28:28,757 --> 01:28:30,758
What are you looking at him for?

1096
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:35,888
Hey, you think I could get
that Sprite, Sean?

1097
01:28:36,682 --> 01:28:38,182
Sure.

1098
01:28:38,475 --> 01:28:40,476
Oh, I get it.

1099
01:28:41,103 --> 01:28:42,937
You're the good cop.

1100
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:46,482
How about a meatball sub
while you're at it?

1101
01:28:46,692 --> 01:28:49,861
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.

1102
01:28:50,988 --> 01:28:54,240
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,
aren't you, Sean?

1103
01:28:56,411 --> 01:28:59,913
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.

1104
01:29:02,667 --> 01:29:05,794
We got a chainlink fence
in our back yard.

1105
01:29:05,962 --> 01:29:09,173
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball
every afternoon after school.

1106
01:29:09,799 --> 01:29:13,969
He's getting good, so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence.

1107
01:29:14,137 --> 01:29:16,805
So I climb it.
Except I slip...

1108
01:29:16,973 --> 01:29:20,184
...slice myself where the links curl in,
right here.

1109
01:29:20,351 --> 01:29:22,144
Bled like hell.

1110
01:29:22,562 --> 01:29:25,814
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.

1111
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:29,568
Probably was still bleeding
when I got in the front seat.

1112
01:29:29,736 --> 01:29:31,445
What blood type are you?

1113
01:29:32,113 --> 01:29:33,780
B- negative.

1114
01:29:34,032 --> 01:29:36,742
Yeah? That's the match we got.

1115
01:29:37,327 --> 01:29:39,411
- Well, there you go.
- Not quite.

1116
01:29:39,579 --> 01:29:42,080
Blood in the trunk of the car
wasn't B-negative.

1117
01:29:43,417 --> 01:29:46,252
I don't know anything
about any blood in the trunk.

1118
01:29:46,921 --> 01:29:50,089
No idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk?

1119
01:29:50,257 --> 01:29:53,426
- None.
- This is not the way you wanna go.

1120
01:29:53,594 --> 01:29:55,303
How will that look in court?

1121
01:29:55,471 --> 01:29:59,390
You not knowing how someone else's
blood got in the trunk of your car?

1122
01:29:59,558 --> 01:30:02,477
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.

1123
01:30:02,978 --> 01:30:04,771
What report?

1124
01:30:05,147 --> 01:30:09,442
The stolen-car report. The car
wasn't in my possession last night.

1125
01:30:09,777 --> 01:30:12,862
So whatever the thieves used it for,
you should find out...

1126
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:15,615
...because it sounds like they
were up to no good.

1127
01:30:21,622 --> 01:30:25,124
Things looking any better
on the Sprite, Sean?

1128
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:28,920
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.

1129
01:30:29,088 --> 01:30:31,757
Anything there, his lawyers say
was put by thieves.

1130
01:30:31,925 --> 01:30:34,510
- I can break him.
- He just kicked our asses!

1131
01:30:34,678 --> 01:30:36,845
You still think Dave
wouldn't hurt a fly...

1132
01:30:37,013 --> 01:30:39,306
- Is that the point? No.
- What is the point?

1133
01:30:39,474 --> 01:30:43,477
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.

1134
01:30:43,812 --> 01:30:46,146
Okay. Maybe.

1135
01:30:48,650 --> 01:30:50,317
So, what do we do with Dave?

1136
01:30:51,987 --> 01:30:53,529
Fuck it. Kick him loose.

1137
01:30:54,406 --> 01:30:58,325
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.

1138
01:30:58,535 --> 01:31:01,829
Or this lovely red marble here.

1139
01:31:02,664 --> 01:31:04,498
Or a figural.

1140
01:31:04,666 --> 01:31:06,250
That one.

1141
01:31:06,751 --> 01:31:10,254
Very good. Nice and simple.

1142
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:20,348
Hey, Jimmy!

1143
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:25,937
Annabeth said you were here.

1144
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:29,399
We been asking around, like you said to.

1145
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:31,109
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1146
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:34,404
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit
you did for me.

1147
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,823
And it ain't about me
missing your brains running things.

1148
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:38,033
I know.

1149
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:42,329
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but
she was part of our family, we loved her.

1150
01:31:42,496 --> 01:31:45,040
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?

1151
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:51,212
Cops are all over this. Doing their job
for once. Bars, street trade, everything.

1152
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:54,841
Every hooker we talked to, bartender,
already been questioned.

1153
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:58,887
- The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
- What about Just Ray's kid?

1154
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:02,932
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.

1155
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:06,395
I talked to Diane and Eve.
They said he loved her.

1156
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:09,231
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.

1157
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:13,736
- Want us to take a run at him?
- No.

1158
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:17,573
Hold off for now.
Anything else?

1159
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:21,869
What?

1160
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:27,708
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.

1161
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,418
Tell him.

1162
01:32:31,088 --> 01:32:34,090
Sean Devine and his partner
went by and saw Dave Boyle.

1163
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:37,968
Dave was at McGill's. Probably
questioning him like everybody else.

1164
01:32:38,679 --> 01:32:40,971
I heard something else this morning too.

1165
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:45,810
- Two staties came by in uniform.
- Maybe forgot to ask him something.

1166
01:32:46,436 --> 01:32:49,188
No. When they left,
they took him with them.

1167
01:32:49,356 --> 01:32:52,442
They put him in the back seat,
if you know what I mean.

1168
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:11,711
"Raymond Matthew Harris,
born 9-6, 1957.

1169
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:14,505
First child, Brendan Seamus, born 1983."

1170
01:33:14,673 --> 01:33:19,301
Same year that Just Ray is indicted
in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.

1171
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:21,804
Charges are dropped, and he's fired.

1172
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:26,142
Does odd jobs after that,
including clerking at Looney Liquors.

1173
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:31,230
Questioned in that robbery. Questioned in
another, same year, Blanchard Liquors...

1174
01:33:31,398 --> 01:33:33,649
...released on lack of evidence again.

1175
01:33:33,817 --> 01:33:36,527
- Beginning to become known, though.
- He's getting popular.

1176
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:40,907
Ooh. "A known associate,
one Edmund Reese, fingers Raymond...

1177
01:33:41,075 --> 01:33:44,661
...in the 1985 heist
of a rare comic-book collection. "

1178
01:33:44,829 --> 01:33:46,329
Comic books? You go, Ray.

1179
01:33:46,497 --> 01:33:49,166
Hey, hey, hey, excuse me,
$150,000 worth of comic books.

1180
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:51,084
Oh, excuse me.

1181
01:33:51,252 --> 01:33:55,172
"Raymond returned said literature
unharmed. " Does a year solid inside.

1182
01:33:55,339 --> 01:33:56,673
Ooh. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

1183
01:33:56,841 --> 01:33:59,342
Comes out with a chemical-dependency
problem.

1184
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:01,344
Gets honest work
to support the habit, though?

1185
01:34:01,512 --> 01:34:04,055
Mm, evidently not.

1186
01:34:04,223 --> 01:34:08,560
Picked up in a joint
MCU-FBI sting operation...

1187
01:34:08,728 --> 01:34:13,190
...trafficking stolen goods across state
lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.

1188
01:34:13,357 --> 01:34:16,193
- The boy's got style.
- Got a boatload of grief too.

1189
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:21,031
Stole the truck in Rhode Island,
drove it into Massachusetts.

1190
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:26,037
- Hence, the federal interstate rap.
- Hence, they got him by the balls, but...

1191
01:34:26,205 --> 01:34:27,872
...he does no time.

1192
01:34:28,665 --> 01:34:32,084
- He rolled on someone.
- Looks that way. After that, he's clean.

1193
01:34:32,252 --> 01:34:36,547
- August 1989, poof, he disappears.
- One, dead, two, in Witness Protection.

1194
01:34:36,715 --> 01:34:40,009
Three, he goes deep underground,
then pops back up...

1195
01:34:40,177 --> 01:34:43,763
...to murder his son's 19-year-old
girlfriend? We got nothing.

1196
01:34:43,931 --> 01:34:48,559
A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years
ago, during which the weapon was used.

1197
01:34:48,727 --> 01:34:52,563
The guy's son dated the victim.
I say we got a lot.

1198
01:34:53,232 --> 01:34:55,608
Anything about Just Ray's
known associates?

1199
01:34:55,776 --> 01:34:58,402
Let's take a look.
"Known criminal associates:

1200
01:34:58,570 --> 01:35:03,407
Reginald 'Dukie' Neil, Kevin
'Whackjob' Sirraci, Nicholas Savage...

1201
01:35:04,076 --> 01:35:05,243
...Anthony Waxman. "

1202
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,122
And one James Markum.

1203
01:35:12,377 --> 01:35:14,753
And the hits just keep on coming.

1204
01:35:18,633 --> 01:35:22,094
- You looking for me?
- I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.

1205
01:35:22,262 --> 01:35:24,346
I already gotta get back.

1206
01:35:24,722 --> 01:35:27,933
So you worked a task force
with Major Crimes in the '80s?

1207
01:35:28,101 --> 01:35:31,603
- Bunch of them.
- You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.

1208
01:35:31,771 --> 01:35:36,275
He stole a truckload of cigarettes from
a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.

1209
01:35:36,484 --> 01:35:39,528
Trucker went to take a piss,
Harris guy jacks the truck.

1210
01:35:39,696 --> 01:35:42,030
I think we pulled him over
in New Bedford.

1211
01:35:42,198 --> 01:35:43,240
But Harris walked.

1212
01:35:43,741 --> 01:35:45,742
He didn't walk, he rolled.

1213
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:50,122
Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in
for info on another case. He rolled.

1214
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:51,874
On who?

1215
01:35:52,625 --> 01:35:54,668
What the fuck was the name?

1216
01:35:54,836 --> 01:35:58,798
Him and three other guys knocked over
the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.

1217
01:35:58,966 --> 01:36:00,758
Jimmy Markum.

1218
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:05,930
Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.
Ran a crew, never got arrested.

1219
01:36:06,223 --> 01:36:08,975
So did Harris ever testify in open court?

1220
01:36:09,143 --> 01:36:12,729
Never went. Markum dummied up
on the guys he was working with...

1221
01:36:12,897 --> 01:36:16,649
...DA was afraid he wouldn't be able
to convict. So he cut a deal.

1222
01:36:16,817 --> 01:36:19,027
Two years inside,
couple more suspended.

1223
01:36:19,194 --> 01:36:22,739
So Jimmy Markum never knew
that Ray Harris ratted him out?

1224
01:36:23,991 --> 01:36:26,534
Ray Harris disappeared
about two months...

1225
01:36:26,702 --> 01:36:29,662
...after Markum rotated back
into the free world.

1226
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:31,497
What's that tell you?

1227
01:36:42,843 --> 01:36:45,511
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.

1228
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,515
- Hey, coz, how you doing?
I'm good.

1229
01:36:48,683 --> 01:36:51,352
Okay. Hey.

1230
01:36:51,519 --> 01:36:54,063
Hey, Celeste.
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey.

1231
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:58,025
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- I'll catch up with you in a minute.

1232
01:37:01,029 --> 01:37:02,696
Step into my office.

1233
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,335
Beautiful day, huh?

1234
01:37:24,469 --> 01:37:26,512
Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.

1235
01:37:32,394 --> 01:37:34,854
I took Michael last night...

1236
01:37:35,398 --> 01:37:37,107
...and I went to a motel.

1237
01:37:39,318 --> 01:37:40,568
Okay.

1238
01:37:41,654 --> 01:37:43,488
I don't know, Jim.

1239
01:37:44,907 --> 01:37:46,908
I might have left Dave for good.

1240
01:37:48,411 --> 01:37:50,286
You left Dave?

1241
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:55,041
Yeah.

1242
01:37:56,252 --> 01:37:57,752
Well...

1243
01:37:59,338 --> 01:38:02,632
...he's been acting kind of nuts lately.

1244
01:38:05,302 --> 01:38:07,137
I'm almost afraid of him.

1245
01:38:11,392 --> 01:38:13,143
Do you know something?

1246
01:38:16,272 --> 01:38:19,274
I know he was taken in by the cops
this morning.

1247
01:38:19,943 --> 01:38:21,860
He saw Katie the night
she was murdered.

1248
01:38:22,028 --> 01:38:25,280
Didn't tell me about it
till after the cops questioned him.

1249
01:38:25,448 --> 01:38:29,617
I know he's got a hand that looks like
it's been punching a fucking wall.

1250
01:38:30,494 --> 01:38:32,787
Is there anything else I should know?

1251
01:38:40,629 --> 01:38:42,213
Come here.

1252
01:38:44,842 --> 01:38:46,342
Okay.

1253
01:38:47,428 --> 01:38:49,721
At 3 in the morning...

1254
01:38:50,014 --> 01:38:55,477
...on Sunday, Dave came back to the
apartment covered in someone's blood.

1255
01:38:59,315 --> 01:39:01,316
What did he say happened?

1256
01:39:02,943 --> 01:39:06,446
That he was mugged.
That he...

1257
01:39:06,614 --> 01:39:09,408
He bashed the mugger's head
in the street.

1258
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:10,826
That...

1259
01:39:10,994 --> 01:39:13,329
That he might have killed him.

1260
01:39:20,003 --> 01:39:23,047
But there was nothing in the paper.

1261
01:39:31,723 --> 01:39:39,105
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1262
01:39:39,272 --> 01:39:40,773
Celeste?

1263
01:39:45,237 --> 01:39:47,655
Do you think Dave killed my Katie?

1264
01:39:52,702 --> 01:39:54,704
Okay. All right.

1265
01:39:54,872 --> 01:39:56,373
Okay.

1266
01:39:57,375 --> 01:39:59,209
Oh, God.

1267
01:40:05,424 --> 01:40:06,925
Okay.

1268
01:40:09,512 --> 01:40:11,555
Oh, my God.

1269
01:40:12,765 --> 01:40:15,767
Tell me about your father.
What?

1270
01:40:15,935 --> 01:40:19,896
Your father, Ray Sr.
You remember him.

1271
01:40:20,189 --> 01:40:23,942
- I was 6 when he left us.
- So you don't remember the guy?

1272
01:40:25,027 --> 01:40:27,279
I remember little things.

1273
01:40:28,072 --> 01:40:30,782
He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.

1274
01:40:31,409 --> 01:40:32,909
He...

1275
01:40:33,578 --> 01:40:35,120
He what?

1276
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:40,584
He carried a lot of change in his pocket.
It jingled when he walked.

1277
01:40:41,086 --> 01:40:43,254
You could always hear him
coming home.

1278
01:40:43,422 --> 01:40:48,676
And if I guessed how much he had,
even if I was close, he'd give it to me.

1279
01:40:49,553 --> 01:40:51,929
You remember your father having a gun?

1280
01:40:52,472 --> 01:40:53,931
No.

1281
01:40:54,099 --> 01:40:58,561
Well, you seem awfully sure for
somebody who was 6 when he left.

1282
01:40:59,313 --> 01:41:00,855
What's up?

1283
01:41:01,023 --> 01:41:03,858
- What's that?
This is what you asked for.

1284
01:41:04,026 --> 01:41:08,613
CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint
analysis, the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.

1285
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:10,448
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

1286
01:41:11,158 --> 01:41:13,784
We were talking about your father's gun.

1287
01:41:14,745 --> 01:41:20,166
- I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
- Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.

1288
01:41:21,001 --> 01:41:23,920
- So when was the last time you talked?
- Never.

1289
01:41:24,129 --> 01:41:25,421
Never?

1290
01:41:25,589 --> 01:41:27,883
He went out for a drink
and never came back.

1291
01:41:28,051 --> 01:41:31,553
But your mother never filed
a missing person's report. Why not?

1292
01:41:31,721 --> 01:41:33,430
Because he's not missing.

1293
01:41:33,598 --> 01:41:36,475
- He sends money every month.
- Sends money?

1294
01:41:37,101 --> 01:41:41,063
Five hundred bucks every month.
Like clockwork.

1295
01:41:42,315 --> 01:41:45,275
- From where?
- Postmark says Brooklyn.

1296
01:41:46,819 --> 01:41:49,488
- How do you know it's him?
- Who else would it be?

1297
01:41:52,283 --> 01:41:54,326
Who else would send it?

1298
01:41:55,495 --> 01:41:57,579
My ma says that's the way he was.

1299
01:41:57,747 --> 01:42:00,666
Do something shitty,
then he'd try to make up for it.

1300
01:42:04,337 --> 01:42:07,172
Why do you keep asking me
if my father had a gun?

1301
01:42:09,092 --> 01:42:10,550
You know why, kid.

1302
01:42:11,094 --> 01:42:12,386
No, I don't.

1303
01:42:13,346 --> 01:42:15,181
The gun that killed your girlfriend...

1304
01:42:15,349 --> 01:42:18,226
...was the same gun your father used
in a robbery 18 years ago.

1305
01:42:19,144 --> 01:42:20,395
So...

1306
01:42:21,021 --> 01:42:23,022
...you wanna tell me about it?

1307
01:42:26,026 --> 01:42:28,361
My father didn't have a gun.

1308
01:42:28,529 --> 01:42:30,530
You are fucking lying!

1309
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:38,663
Can I go now?

1310
01:42:39,415 --> 01:42:42,208
Or are you gonna charge me
with Katie's murder?

1311
01:42:55,389 --> 01:42:59,058
Hey! Dandy Dave Boyle,
how's it hanging?

1312
01:43:00,019 --> 01:43:01,770
Hey, Val.

1313
01:43:02,147 --> 01:43:04,440
Nick. How you guys holding up?

1314
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:07,234
All right.
- It's fucked up.

1315
01:43:09,654 --> 01:43:11,155
Katie.

1316
01:43:12,574 --> 01:43:14,408
A fucking tragedy.

1317
01:43:15,577 --> 01:43:16,827
Yeah.

1318
01:43:16,995 --> 01:43:19,705
We're gonna get a couple of beers
and a bite to eat.

1319
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,290
Yeah?

1320
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:24,335
Yeah. What do you say, man? Hm?

1321
01:43:24,502 --> 01:43:28,297
How about a boys' night out
in the middle of the day?

1322
01:43:30,925 --> 01:43:34,636
- I gotta get home after a while.
- Don't we all? Hop in.

1323
01:43:34,804 --> 01:43:36,597
- Come on, get in.
- All right.

1324
01:43:37,765 --> 01:43:40,933
Well, the first round's on me.

1325
01:43:42,603 --> 01:43:44,645
Now you're talking.

1326
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:05,292
I think the kid is lying about the gun.

1327
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:07,878
Absolutely. I told you
three times already.

1328
01:44:08,046 --> 01:44:13,050
- What about the father?
- I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is alive.

1329
01:44:13,426 --> 01:44:14,802
Eighty grand. I mean...

1330
01:44:14,969 --> 01:44:18,639
...who else is gonna send
that kind of money if not the father?

1331
01:44:19,682 --> 01:44:23,310
Listen, go home, have a drink.

1332
01:44:23,478 --> 01:44:26,939
- Let it go for a while.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1333
01:44:27,107 --> 01:44:29,441
Hey, anything good on the 911?

1334
01:44:29,609 --> 01:44:33,195
- I thought you listened to it.
- I thought you listened to it.

1335
01:44:37,493 --> 01:44:40,662
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

1336
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:44,040
There's, like, this car
with blood in it, and the door's open.

1337
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:47,168
What's the location of the car?
Sydney Street.

1338
01:44:47,336 --> 01:44:51,089
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend, we just found it.

1339
01:44:51,257 --> 01:44:54,092
Son, what's your name?
He wants to know her name.

1340
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:57,345
Your name, what's your name?
We're so fucking out of here.

1341
01:44:57,513 --> 01:44:59,389
Good luck, man.

1342
01:44:59,682 --> 01:45:03,685
That about cracks the case, don't it?
Let's get a burger or something.

1343
01:45:03,853 --> 01:45:05,437
Her.

1344
01:45:06,188 --> 01:45:09,524
- What?
- The kid on the tape.

1345
01:45:13,821 --> 01:45:16,865
Son, what's your name?
He wants to know her name.

1346
01:45:17,032 --> 01:45:21,161
- He said, "Her name. "
- She's a dead girl, refer to her as a she.

1347
01:45:21,328 --> 01:45:23,914
How does the kid know?
Girl's dead in the park.

1348
01:45:24,082 --> 01:45:27,460
How does he know the blood in the car
came from a woman?

1349
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:33,424
Play it again.

1350
01:45:39,723 --> 01:45:43,225
This one time, we're going
to take down this stamp collector.

1351
01:45:43,393 --> 01:45:45,686
- Tie him up, rob him, we're out.
Here.

1352
01:45:45,854 --> 01:45:49,106
It was me, Nicky and this kid
Carson Leverett.

1353
01:45:49,316 --> 01:45:52,026
Mm, fucking Carson.

1354
01:45:52,194 --> 01:45:56,322
I swear, this kid couldn't tie his own
fucking shoe if you didn't show him.

1355
01:45:56,490 --> 01:45:58,908
We all wear suits
because we want to fit in.

1356
01:45:59,075 --> 01:46:03,913
We're in the elevator, it stops, this old
lady gets on. She starts screaming!

1357
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:09,502
Now Val turns to me,
but I'm looking at Carson.

1358
01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:11,671
I'm thinking, "What the fuck?"

1359
01:46:11,839 --> 01:46:17,135
Because that fucking bonehead's
still got his Ronald Reagan mask on!

1360
01:46:17,303 --> 01:46:19,054
Fucking smiley mask!

1361
01:46:21,516 --> 01:46:23,016
Idiot!

1362
01:46:23,184 --> 01:46:25,644
And you guys didn't notice till then?

1363
01:46:27,563 --> 01:46:31,900
Shit like that happened all the time on
jobs. That's why Jimmy was so missed.

1364
01:46:32,068 --> 01:46:34,861
He saw shit happen
before it even went down.

1365
01:46:37,406 --> 01:46:39,449
Why do you think he went straight?

1366
01:46:42,161 --> 01:46:44,621
One word, pure and simple. Katie.

1367
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:48,917
What about you guys?

1368
01:46:50,127 --> 01:46:53,922
What? Us? Going straight?

1369
01:46:55,341 --> 01:46:57,802
That's pretty fucking funny!

1370
01:47:01,557 --> 01:47:06,310
We're like bats, we like night too much.
Days are just good for sleeping through.

1371
01:47:06,478 --> 01:47:08,145
Want another shot?

1372
01:47:11,733 --> 01:47:14,360
You know, I should slow down
till we eat.

1373
01:47:14,528 --> 01:47:16,988
Come on, don't go fucking pussy on us!

1374
01:47:17,155 --> 01:47:18,573
Come on, get up.

1375
01:47:23,829 --> 01:47:25,830
Live a little, huh?

1376
01:47:53,192 --> 01:47:55,110
Slide over, Dave.

1377
01:47:56,613 --> 01:47:59,698
- Dave.
All right, Val! Now you're talking.

1378
01:47:59,866 --> 01:48:03,327
- How you doing?
- I'm a little drunk.

1379
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,873
To our children.

1380
01:48:12,712 --> 01:48:14,671
I always liked this bar.
- Yeah.

1381
01:48:16,090 --> 01:48:18,175
Yeah, nobody bothers you.

1382
01:48:18,343 --> 01:48:21,386
The way it should be,
nobody to bother you in this life.

1383
01:48:21,554 --> 01:48:25,140
No one fucking with you
or your loved ones. Right, Dave?

1384
01:48:25,308 --> 01:48:27,893
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

1385
01:48:28,061 --> 01:48:30,647
This guy's a hoot.
He can really get you going.

1386
01:48:30,814 --> 01:48:32,148
Yeah.

1387
01:48:32,316 --> 01:48:34,067
Oh, yeah, my man Dave.

1388
01:48:39,948 --> 01:48:41,866
Kevin, will you bring us a bottle?

1389
01:48:53,087 --> 01:48:55,879
- Drink up, Dave.
- Come on.

1390
01:48:56,589 --> 01:48:58,256
Thanks, Kevin.

1391
01:49:34,461 --> 01:49:37,505
Remember we took Ray Harris here
that time?

1392
01:49:37,673 --> 01:49:43,052
Everybody called this guy "Just Ray,"
but Val here called him "Ray Jingles. "

1393
01:49:45,472 --> 01:49:48,266
This guy walked around
with 10 bucks in change...

1394
01:49:48,434 --> 01:49:51,352
...in case he had to make a call
to Iraq or something.

1395
01:49:51,562 --> 01:49:53,479
Are you all right, Dave? Dave?

1396
01:49:53,939 --> 01:49:56,816
- You all right?
- Shit. I'm gonna be sick.

1397
01:49:56,984 --> 01:49:58,484
Come on. Come on, now.

1398
01:49:58,652 --> 01:50:03,656
Dave, use the back door. Huey
don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims.

1399
01:50:26,765 --> 01:50:28,182
Hey, Ray.

1400
01:50:41,362 --> 01:50:44,156
You guys come to make sure
I didn't fall in?

1401
01:50:49,037 --> 01:50:50,871
Come here a second.

1402
01:50:56,378 --> 01:50:57,921
Sit down.

1403
01:51:07,306 --> 01:51:09,933
Let me tell you about Ray Harris.

1404
01:51:10,226 --> 01:51:14,020
He was a buddy of mine.
He used to visit me in prison.

1405
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:19,484
He checked in on Marita and Katie,
my mother, if they needed anything.

1406
01:51:19,652 --> 01:51:22,237
He's also the one who put me in.
He ratted me out.

1407
01:51:22,404 --> 01:51:25,031
- Shit, that's terrible.
- My wife had cancer at the time.

1408
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:27,700
- Yeah, I remember.
- Ray robbed me of being with her...

1409
01:51:27,868 --> 01:51:29,118
...when she was dying.

1410
01:51:29,286 --> 01:51:33,540
The death part you do alone, but I could
have helped her with the dying.

1411
01:51:33,707 --> 01:51:35,750
Why are you telling me this?

1412
01:51:35,918 --> 01:51:40,130
I knelt Ray down over there and
I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.

1413
01:51:40,298 --> 01:51:42,758
- We were both crying when I did it.
- Jimmy...

1414
01:51:42,926 --> 01:51:44,468
He was begging.

1415
01:51:44,636 --> 01:51:47,388
You know, pregnant wife, little Brendan.

1416
01:51:48,348 --> 01:51:52,017
He said he knew me.
He said I was a good man.

1417
01:51:52,769 --> 01:51:55,604
What do you think, Dave?
You think I'm a good man?

1418
01:51:56,439 --> 01:51:57,857
Who do you hate?

1419
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:01,694
Come on, who?

1420
01:52:01,862 --> 01:52:03,362
No one.

1421
01:52:05,657 --> 01:52:10,452
- What is it you think I did?
- As I was holding him under the water...

1422
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:14,123
...I could feel God watching me,
shaking his head. Not angry...

1423
01:52:14,291 --> 01:52:16,667
...but like if a puppy shit on a rug.

1424
01:52:17,127 --> 01:52:18,627
Who do you love?

1425
01:52:23,258 --> 01:52:24,925
You love me.

1426
01:52:27,096 --> 01:52:28,471
What about Ma?

1427
01:52:33,728 --> 01:52:37,314
You love me so much,
I wanna hear you say it.

1428
01:52:40,318 --> 01:52:44,446
- You think I killed Katie, don't you?
- Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.

1429
01:52:44,614 --> 01:52:47,324
No, I killed someone,
but I didn't kill Katie.

1430
01:52:47,783 --> 01:52:49,492
This is the mugger story.

1431
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:51,828
He wasn't a mugger,
he was a child molester.

1432
01:52:51,996 --> 01:52:54,205
He was having sex with
this kid in his car.

1433
01:52:54,373 --> 01:52:58,168
He was a fucking wolf!
He was a vampire!

1434
01:53:06,344 --> 01:53:07,594
Get out of here.

1435
01:53:20,359 --> 01:53:21,776
Run!

1436
01:53:22,402 --> 01:53:24,028
Dave, run!

1437
01:53:26,198 --> 01:53:29,909
You killed a child molester.
- Yeah. Well, me and the boy.

1438
01:53:30,744 --> 01:53:33,704
- The molested boy helped you.
- Oh, no. No...

1439
01:53:33,872 --> 01:53:38,501
- You just said you and the boy!
- No, forget that!

1440
01:53:38,669 --> 01:53:43,047
- My head gets fucked up sometimes.
- Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.

1441
01:53:44,466 --> 01:53:47,802
You'd rather have her think that
than you killed a child molester?

1442
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:51,472
People don't care if a child molester dies.
Why not tell the truth?

1443
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:56,060
I don't know. Maybe I thought
I was turning into him.

1444
01:53:56,228 --> 01:53:58,437
I didn't kill Katie.

1445
01:53:59,231 --> 01:54:03,360
I don't remember hearing anything about
any guy's body being found.

1446
01:54:03,528 --> 01:54:07,823
- I put him in the trunk of my car.
Letting this piece of shit explain?

1447
01:54:07,991 --> 01:54:10,992
- Fuck him. Fuck him! Do him!
- I didn't kill her!

1448
01:54:11,159 --> 01:54:15,162
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Everybody shut up!

1449
01:54:15,330 --> 01:54:18,916
This is my daughter I'm talking about!
Shut up!

1450
01:54:19,084 --> 01:54:20,418
- Fuck!
Shut up!

1451
01:54:24,673 --> 01:54:25,965
Nineteen years old.

1452
01:54:26,133 --> 01:54:28,592
- I didn't kill Katie!
- Nineteen years old!

1453
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:31,929
- Look at me, Jimmy!
- I'm looking at you, Dave.

1454
01:54:32,097 --> 01:54:33,514
I'm looking at you.

1455
01:54:33,682 --> 01:54:36,392
Why'd you do it?

1456
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:41,772
Me and my son. Me and Celeste. There's
so many things we gotta make right.

1457
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:44,608
Make it right now. Start now.
Admit what you did.

1458
01:54:44,985 --> 01:54:47,738
No more lies, no more secrets.

1459
01:54:47,905 --> 01:54:50,574
I wanna go home to Celeste.
I wanna feel Celeste.

1460
01:54:51,451 --> 01:54:55,662
Right after you do your time. I did mine,
you do yours. Admit what you did.

1461
01:54:56,622 --> 01:54:59,833
- The boy...
- One more time about the boy...

1462
01:55:00,001 --> 01:55:01,960
...and I will open you the fuck up.

1463
01:55:07,842 --> 01:55:10,677
I thought I was finished with all this.

1464
01:55:11,054 --> 01:55:14,514
I mean, killing people
and dumping them in the river.

1465
01:55:19,812 --> 01:55:23,356
You admit what you did, Dave,
and I'm gonna let you live.

1466
01:55:23,775 --> 01:55:27,819
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

1467
01:55:28,446 --> 01:55:32,115
Admit what you did,
and I will give you your life.

1468
01:55:32,283 --> 01:55:34,202
Admit what you did, Dave.

1469
01:55:34,369 --> 01:55:36,662
Admit what you did.

1470
01:55:38,332 --> 01:55:41,250
Admit what you did.
Admit what you did.

1471
01:55:42,169 --> 01:55:43,711
I know you can speak.

1472
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:50,468
So say it. Say you love me.

1473
01:55:53,847 --> 01:55:57,517
Don't look at him, look at me.
Now, you say it. You say you love me.

1474
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:09,195
- He never does anything without you!
- No, let me go! Stop!

1475
01:56:16,537 --> 01:56:18,162
I'm coming back!

1476
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:27,548
You love me so much,
you gotta kill my fucking girlfriend, huh?

1477
01:56:27,715 --> 01:56:32,511
Speak, you fucking freak,
or I will fucking kill you!

1478
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,013
Say her name. Say it.

1479
01:56:35,473 --> 01:56:39,351
Say it! Katie!
Say it or you die!

1480
01:56:50,905 --> 01:56:55,409
Kid, you want to point that
toward the floor, okay?

1481
01:56:56,077 --> 01:56:57,744
That's a Sig, right?

1482
01:57:00,081 --> 01:57:02,291
Don't you want to draw it on me?

1483
01:57:03,251 --> 01:57:05,752
No, I don't want to hurt a kid.

1484
01:57:06,045 --> 01:57:09,090
Plus, it looks like somebody else
beat me to it.

1485
01:57:09,925 --> 01:57:12,927
Brendan, man, he fucking punched me.

1486
01:57:13,762 --> 01:57:16,723
- He broke my nose.
We'll arrest him.

1487
01:57:16,891 --> 01:57:20,560
- Haul his ass to jail if you like.
- I don't want him arrested.

1488
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:22,979
I want him fucking dead!

1489
01:57:30,362 --> 01:57:35,658
Motherfucker.

1490
01:57:37,953 --> 01:57:40,872
Admit what you did, Dave...

1491
01:57:41,957 --> 01:57:43,958
...and I'll let you live.

1492
01:57:44,126 --> 01:57:48,338
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

1493
01:57:48,714 --> 01:57:50,882
You'll go to prison...

1494
01:57:51,967 --> 01:57:55,346
...but I'll give you your life.
Admit it, Dave.

1495
01:57:55,513 --> 01:57:58,641
Admit what you did. Admit it.

1496
01:58:03,563 --> 01:58:05,314
Yeah.

1497
01:58:07,484 --> 01:58:09,360
Yeah, I did it.

1498
01:58:12,822 --> 01:58:16,116
Why?

1499
01:58:19,287 --> 01:58:23,582
That night in McGill's...

1500
01:58:24,542 --> 01:58:29,171
...she reminded me of a dream I had.

1501
01:58:30,382 --> 01:58:31,799
What dream?

1502
01:58:33,301 --> 01:58:35,761
A dream of youth.

1503
01:58:38,098 --> 01:58:40,683
I don't remember having one.

1504
01:58:43,145 --> 01:58:45,146
So it was the dream?

1505
01:58:46,816 --> 01:58:49,234
The dream, yeah.

1506
01:58:50,444 --> 01:58:55,824
You'd know what I mean
if you'd got in that car instead of me.

1507
01:59:02,415 --> 01:59:05,375
But I didn't get in that car, Dave.

1508
01:59:06,669 --> 01:59:09,587
Hang on. Come here. You did.

1509
01:59:31,027 --> 01:59:33,403
We bury our sins here, Dave.

1510
01:59:36,365 --> 01:59:38,742
We wash them clean.

1511
01:59:40,995 --> 01:59:45,248
His fucking lips are still moving.
- I got eyes, Val.

1512
01:59:51,714 --> 01:59:53,757
I wasn't ready.

1513
01:59:59,764 --> 02:00:01,097
It's like I said, Dave.

1514
02:00:04,393 --> 02:00:06,102
This part, you do alone.

1515
02:00:51,024 --> 02:00:52,900
Tough night?

1516
02:00:55,654 --> 02:00:57,655
Yeah, me too.

1517
02:00:59,658 --> 02:01:02,577
Saw a bullet with my name on it.

1518
02:01:11,295 --> 02:01:13,046
We got them, Jim.

1519
02:01:16,801 --> 02:01:18,176
Got who?

1520
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:20,887
Katie's killers. Got them cold.

1521
02:01:25,476 --> 02:01:28,311
Killers, plural.

1522
02:01:29,105 --> 02:01:34,443
Yeah, kids, actually. Ray Harris' son
Ray Jr. And another kid, John O'Shea.

1523
02:01:34,610 --> 02:01:37,028
They just confessed a couple hours ago.

1524
02:01:41,701 --> 02:01:43,076
No doubt?

1525
02:01:43,828 --> 02:01:45,537
None.

1526
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:56,340
Why?

1527
02:01:57,885 --> 02:01:59,635
They don't know.

1528
02:01:59,803 --> 02:02:02,346
They were playing with a gun,
saw a car coming...

1529
02:02:02,514 --> 02:02:07,602
...one of the kids lies down in the street,
car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie.

1530
02:02:09,396 --> 02:02:13,274
O'Shea says they just meant to scare her
and the gun went off.

1531
02:02:13,442 --> 02:02:16,861
But she hit him with her door, ran...

1532
02:02:17,029 --> 02:02:20,948
...and they chased her
so she wouldn't tell anyone.

1533
02:02:28,874 --> 02:02:30,750
And the beating they gave her?

1534
02:02:33,253 --> 02:02:34,921
Ray Jr. Had a hockey stick.

1535
02:02:38,092 --> 02:02:40,344
All right. Go easy.

1536
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:42,429
Take a breath.

1537
02:02:43,806 --> 02:02:45,641
Look at me.

1538
02:02:45,934 --> 02:02:47,851
Look at me, Jimmy.

1539
02:02:50,188 --> 02:02:52,523
I got a call from Celeste Boyle.

1540
02:02:52,690 --> 02:02:57,027
She was hysterical. Says Dave's missing,
says you might know where he is.

1541
02:02:57,987 --> 02:03:00,239
We need to talk to him.

1542
02:03:00,615 --> 02:03:05,077
Boston P.D. Found the body of a guy
in the woods behind McGill's.

1543
02:03:05,245 --> 02:03:07,663
A body? The body of a guy?

1544
02:03:08,289 --> 02:03:11,458
Yeah, a pedophile with three priors.

1545
02:03:11,709 --> 02:03:14,545
They want to talk to Dave about it.

1546
02:03:15,088 --> 02:03:17,130
So, Jimmy...

1547
02:03:18,091 --> 02:03:20,676
...when was the last time
you saw Dave?

1548
02:03:31,397 --> 02:03:34,607
The last time I saw Dave.

1549
02:03:36,151 --> 02:03:39,362
Yeah. Dave Boyle.

1550
02:03:47,663 --> 02:03:52,000
- Dave Boyle.
- Yeah, Jimmy. Dave Boyle.

1551
02:03:54,670 --> 02:03:59,465
That was 25 years ago, going up
this street in the back of that car.

1552
02:04:08,684 --> 02:04:12,688
Jimmy, what did you do?

1553
02:04:20,822 --> 02:04:23,782
Thanks for finding
my daughter's killers, Sean.

1554
02:04:27,537 --> 02:04:30,039
If only you'd been a little faster.

1555
02:04:38,298 --> 02:04:42,008
Are you gonna send Celeste Boyle
500 a month too?

1556
02:04:48,599 --> 02:04:51,225
Sometimes I think...

1557
02:04:52,186 --> 02:04:55,146
I think all three of us got in that car.

1558
02:04:55,981 --> 02:05:00,235
And all of this is just a dream,
you know?

1559
02:05:00,403 --> 02:05:02,571
A dream, sure.

1560
02:05:03,948 --> 02:05:06,241
In reality...

1561
02:05:06,409 --> 02:05:11,121
...we're still 11-year-old boys
locked in a cellar...

1562
02:05:11,289 --> 02:05:14,875
...imagining what our lives
would have been if we'd escaped.

1563
02:05:23,009 --> 02:05:25,094
Maybe you're right.

1564
02:05:25,261 --> 02:05:27,596
Who the fuck knows?

1565
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:58,128
Yeah, this is Sean.

1566
02:06:04,051 --> 02:06:07,137
I'm sorry. I need you to know that.

1567
02:06:07,304 --> 02:06:09,597
I pushed you away.

1568
02:06:12,351 --> 02:06:14,769
I'm sorry too.

1569
02:06:15,730 --> 02:06:18,523
Things have been so messed up.

1570
02:06:18,691 --> 02:06:21,276
Loving you, hating you.

1571
02:06:23,487 --> 02:06:25,155
Come home?

1572
02:06:27,908 --> 02:06:29,868
You change the locks or anything?

1573
02:06:30,995 --> 02:06:32,747
No.

1574
02:06:33,707 --> 02:06:36,834
No, everything is just the way you left it.

1575
02:06:38,003 --> 02:06:40,796
- Nora.
- What's that?

1576
02:06:42,048 --> 02:06:45,718
Nora. That's our daughter's name, Sean.

1577
02:06:46,845 --> 02:06:48,596
Nora, huh?

1578
02:06:48,764 --> 02:06:52,767
Well, I like that. Nora.

1579
02:07:22,632 --> 02:07:24,925
I killed Dave.

1580
02:07:25,718 --> 02:07:28,845
I killed him, and I threw him
in the Mystic.

1581
02:07:29,889 --> 02:07:31,765
But I killed the wrong man.

1582
02:07:32,433 --> 02:07:34,726
That's what I've done.

1583
02:07:35,394 --> 02:07:37,771
- And I can't undo it.
- Shh.

1584
02:07:38,773 --> 02:07:40,607
Jimmy.

1585
02:07:42,610 --> 02:07:44,778
Shh.

1586
02:07:48,449 --> 02:07:51,284
I wanna feel your heart.

1587
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:53,411
Last night...

1588
02:07:53,830 --> 02:07:57,999
...when I put the girls to bed,
I told them how big your heart was.

1589
02:07:58,167 --> 02:08:01,253
- I told them how much you loved Katie...
- Annabeth.

1590
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:03,088
...because you created her.

1591
02:08:03,256 --> 02:08:07,176
And sometimes,
your love for her was so big...

1592
02:08:07,344 --> 02:08:11,138
...it felt like your heart would explode...
- Please stop.

1593
02:08:11,306 --> 02:08:15,142
I told them their daddy
loved them that much too.

1594
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:18,813
That he had four hearts,
and they were all filled up...

1595
02:08:18,981 --> 02:08:22,942
...and aching with a love that meant
we would never have to worry.

1596
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:29,156
And that their daddy would do
whatever he had to for those he loved.

1597
02:08:29,324 --> 02:08:32,535
And that is never wrong.

1598
02:08:32,703 --> 02:08:38,624
That can never be wrong,
no matter what their daddy had to do.

1599
02:08:38,792 --> 02:08:43,504
And those girls fell asleep at peace.

1600
02:08:52,014 --> 02:08:56,518
You said, "Last night. " You knew?

1601
02:08:57,604 --> 02:08:59,813
Celeste called, looking for you.

1602
02:08:59,981 --> 02:09:03,317
She was worried something might
happen. She told me about Dave.

1603
02:09:03,484 --> 02:09:06,320
Told me what she told you.
What kind of wife...

1604
02:09:06,487 --> 02:09:09,656
...says that about her husband?
And why'd she run to you?

1605
02:09:09,824 --> 02:09:13,994
Why didn't you call?
- Because it's like I told the girls.

1606
02:09:14,412 --> 02:09:16,663
Their daddy's a king.

1607
02:09:16,831 --> 02:09:21,084
And a king knows what to do
and does it.

1608
02:09:21,252 --> 02:09:22,836
Even when it's hard.

1609
02:09:23,004 --> 02:09:27,382
And their daddy will do whatever
he has to for those he loves.

1610
02:09:27,550 --> 02:09:30,344
And that's all that matters.

1611
02:09:35,224 --> 02:09:38,894
Because everyone is weak, Jimmy.

1612
02:09:39,062 --> 02:09:41,356
Everyone but us.

1613
02:09:41,523 --> 02:09:43,691
We will never be weak.

1614
02:09:43,859 --> 02:09:46,027
And you...

1615
02:09:46,946 --> 02:09:49,614
You could rule this town.

1616
02:09:53,410 --> 02:09:56,037
And after, Jimmy...

1617
02:09:56,205 --> 02:09:58,956
...let's take the girls down to the parade.

1618
02:09:59,123 --> 02:10:01,875
Katie would have liked that.

1619
02:11:38,892 --> 02:11:40,809
Michael!

1620
02:11:41,478 --> 02:11:45,689
Michael! Michael!

1621
02:11:46,983 --> 02:11:51,487
Michael!
