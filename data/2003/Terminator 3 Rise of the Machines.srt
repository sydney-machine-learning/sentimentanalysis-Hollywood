1
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:53,639
The future has not been written.

2
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:57,438
There is no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

3
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:14,406
I wish I could believe that.

4
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:19,840
My name is John Connor.

5
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:23,447
They tried to murder me
before I was born.

6
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:27,719
When I was 13, they tried again.

7
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,881
Machines from the future.

8
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:33,563
Terminators.

9
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:38,083
All my life, my mother told me
the storm was coming.

10
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,401
-Judgment Day.
-Connor!

11
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:44,325
The beginning of a war
between man and machines.

12
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:49,764
Three billion lives
would vanish in an instant.

13
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:55,802
And I would lead what was left
of the human race to ultimate victory.

14
00:02:58,249 --> 00:02:59,841
It hasn't happened.

15
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,285
No bombs fell.

16
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,839
Computers didn't take control.

17
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:10,039
We stopped Judgment Day.

18
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:15,081
I should feel safe...

19
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,079
...but I don't.

20
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:22,043
So I live off the grid.

21
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,566
No phone, no address.

22
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:31,200
No one and nothing can find me.

23
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:35,521
I've erased all connections
to the past.

24
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:38,879
But as hard as I try...

25
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,087
...l can't erase my dreams...

26
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:45,002
...my nightmares.

27
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:58,605
I feel the weight of the future
bearing down on me.

28
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,165
A future I don't want.

29
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:04,798
So I keep running...

30
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:06,846
...as fast as I can.

31
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:10,319
Anywhere.

32
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:12,719
Nowhere.

33
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:54,159
Oh, my God.

34
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:56,126
Are you okay?

35
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,245
Do you want me to call 91 1 ?

36
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,206
I like this car.

37
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:07,323
What are you--?

38
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:33,441
LOS ANGELES UNIFIED
SCHOOL DISTRICT

39
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:10,958
You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

40
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:13,359
Slow down and pull over immediately.

41
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,805
Lady, have you any idea
how fast you were going?

42
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:49,846
Let me see your license
and registration.

43
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,927
I like your gun.

44
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:57,207
What?

45
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,518
This stupid thing's not working.

46
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,765
What's wrong with this thing?

47
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,966
I hate machines.

48
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:13,727
-Hello?
-Kate, it's your father.

49
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:17,086
You're blowing me off again.

50
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:20,321
I'm so sorry. You know how much
I wanted to see you this weekend.

51
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:25,244
-We're having computer problems--
-I know, you can't talk about it.

52
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:26,843
It's just...

53
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,799
...Scott was really looking forward
to this.

54
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:34,759
Katie. I wish I had more time
to get to know him. I really do.

55
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:38,638
That's okay. You're bound
to run into him at the wedding.

56
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:41,922
Please. I'm still
in a state of denial about that.

57
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:45,362
-You're not the only one.
-Hey, kiddo.

58
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:47,884
You don't need me
to pass judgment on this guy.

59
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,279
You've done the right thing
your whole life.

60
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:52,724
You won't make a mistake.
You never do.

61
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:56,040
I'm the luckiest father
in the world, you know?

62
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:59,485
I've never had to be afraid
for my daughter.

63
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,324
Listen, I hate this. I gotta run. Come
see me. I promise I won't cancel.

64
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,604
We will.

65
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,567
-Bye, Dad, I love you.
-Love you too.

66
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:23,485
-Okay, what have we got?
-This new computer virus is tricky.

67
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:27,199
It's infected half the civilian lnternet
as well as secondary military apps.

68
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:30,042
-Payroll, inventory.
-Primary defence nets are still clean?

69
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:32,359
So far the firewalls are holding up.

70
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:36,158
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we
use our AI to scan the infrastructure.

71
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:38,684
Search and destroy
for any hint of the virus.

72
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,046
I know, Tony, but that's like
going after a fly with a bazooka.

73
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,723
Once the connection's made,
it should only be a few minutes.

74
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:49,087
During which we put everything under
the control of one computer system.

75
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,922
The most intelligent system
ever conceived.

76
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,922
I still prefer to keep humans
in the loop.

77
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,159
I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

78
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:59,162
Yes, sir.

79
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:30,758
Thanks.

80
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:40,644
You're supposed to go around
to the back.

81
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,440
Hey, I said you're supposed to go--

82
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:26,447
-Take off your clothes.
-Patience, honey.

83
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:35,038
Bitch. Wait your turn.

84
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,121
-Your clothes.
-Talk to the hand.

85
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42,440
Now.

86
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:00,728
Welcome to Jim's Burgers.
Can I take your order?

87
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:04,564
-Jose Barrera?
-Yeah, that's me.

88
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:25,844
Growing concern over widespread
outages in the global digital network...

89
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:29,286
...have prompted rumours
of a new computer super-virus.

90
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:32,885
-Wall Street analysts are confident....
-Shit! My mom's home.

91
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:36,008
Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer.
Here. Take that.

92
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:38,924
Go, go, go.

93
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:47,199
Elizabeth and William Anderson?

94
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:52,127
I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs.
Is there something wrong?

95
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,167
What's going on?

96
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,401
I have to go to the clinic.
It's an emergency.

97
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,640
It's 4:30 in the morning.

98
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:15,360
Well, I'll be back before you get up.

99
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,477
Cool it, guys, it's just me.

100
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:02,880
We've got a sick cat coming in.

101
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:25,004
Great.

102
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:27,487
Junkies.

103
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:34,445
Please, don't do that.

104
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:40,444
I suppose it was you who
ripped us off last week.

105
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,328
Put the phone down.

106
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,280
Sorry.

107
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:48,082
I just....

108
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:50,240
I needed some medicine.

109
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:53,879
There's an emergency clinic
half a mile away.

110
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,562
Can't do that.

111
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:02,724
How much did you take?

112
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:04,607
-Enough.
-Well...

113
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,286
...this is the stuff we use
to chemically neuter dogs.

114
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:12,408
Take a look.

115
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,563
Hey!

116
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:22,965
Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

117
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:26,158
Next time bring a clue,
not a paintball gun.

118
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:29,685
-No, this isn't what you think.
-Yeah, right.

119
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:51,761
I think Hercules has got pneumonia.
He started coughing and won't stop.

120
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,207
-Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.
-A problem? This is an emergency!

121
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:59,845
-It sounds like a hairball.
-I know what a hairball sounds like.

122
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:03,001
-Where's Dr. Monroe?
-It's 5:30 in the morning.

123
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:06,320
I'm sure he's home sleeping.
He'll come in if he has to.

124
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:11,560
Just wait in here with Hercules
and I'll be a few minutes, all right?

125
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:30,720
Mike Kripke's basement.

126
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:34,123
What? What does that mean?

127
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:47,641
You're John Connor.

128
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:55,086
I'm Kate Brewster.

129
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:00,363
We went to
West Hills Junior High together.

130
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:07,726
-Jesus.
-What happened to you, John?

131
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:11,843
Middle of eighth grade,
you just disappeared.

132
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:15,206
And there was that thing
about your foster parents.

133
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:17,969
Yeah, they were murdered.

134
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,249
I didn't do it.

135
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,605
What the hell?

136
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:28,283
Is somebody with you?

137
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,208
Katherine Brewster?

138
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,683
No.

139
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:56,961
John Connor was here.
Where did he go?

140
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:00,288
Tell me. Where did he go?

141
00:24:38,449 --> 00:24:39,802
Katherine Brewster?

142
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:46,764
What are you doing? Let me down!

143
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:50,206
Let me down! Let me down!

144
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:54,724
Where is John Connor?

145
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:57,642
If I tell you, will you let me go?

146
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,881
Yes.

147
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:02,279
He's...

148
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:05,486
...in the kennel, in a cage.

149
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:11,125
You said that you'd let me go.

150
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:12,802
I lied.

151
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:18,168
Please, please, please.
You have to let me go!

152
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,921
John Connor.

153
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:11,049
It is time.

154
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:14,562
You here to kill me?

155
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:23,087
No. You must live.

156
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:34,564
Why are you here?

157
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:37,118
-Where are we going?
-Keep moving.

158
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:41,964
Get out of here.

159
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,687
Now!

160
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:33,918
-No pulse.
-See if you can get him down.

161
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,281
I can't.

162
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,405
This guy weighs a ton.

163
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,040
-91 1.
-Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

164
00:28:06,209 --> 00:28:09,599
-Where are you now?
-I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

165
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:12,159
It's a Toyota Tundra.

166
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:17,517
It says " Emery Animal Hospital" on
the side. I'm locked inside the back.

167
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:19,843
Hello?

168
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:22,924
Hello?

169
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,439
Shit! Shit!

170
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:39,881
Get off.

171
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:56,358
Let me out!

172
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:58,168
What are you doing here?

173
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,763
You tell me. You got me into this.

174
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:03,325
-Stop the car.
-I can't. Not yet.

175
00:30:03,489 --> 00:30:07,368
-You bastard! Stop the car!
-Shut up!

176
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:20,798
Son of a bitch.

177
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,280
Goddamn it.

178
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:25,360
Look what you did to my car.

179
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:28,680
This is my company car, asshole.

180
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,328
Get your ass out here.

181
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:32,605
Get your ass out of the car. Now!

182
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:34,567
What are you doing?

183
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:37,722
If you don't have insurance,
I'm gonna rip your balls off.

184
00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:40,039
-I don't want any problems, okay?
-Shut up!

185
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:41,278
Help!

186
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:43,599
Who's talking back there?
What's going on?

187
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:44,924
-Calm down.
-Shut up!

188
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:48,684
-I'm being kidnapped! Call the police!
-Well, I'll be goddamned.

189
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,646
-Call 91 1 !
-A cop when you need one.

190
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,561
Help, please! Please!

191
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:55,437
Let me out of here! Help!

192
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,683
Get back here, asshole!

193
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:24,559
That's the cops!
You have to pull over!

194
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:26,287
Yeah, first chance I get.

195
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:30,608
Hold on!

196
00:33:37,689 --> 00:33:39,805
Stop it!

197
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,123
I'll drive.

198
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:52,207
Get out.

199
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,440
Excuse me.

200
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:32,163
Move over.

201
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,199
No sign of brain trauma.

202
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:07,117
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

203
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:13,599
Do you even remember me?

204
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:18,079
Sarah Connor?
Blowing up Cyberdyne?

205
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:21,486
"Hasta la vista, baby."
Ring any bells?

206
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:24,038
That was a different T-1 01 .

207
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:26,798
What, do you come off
an assembly line or something?

208
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:28,118
Exactly.

209
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:32,080
Oh, man. I'm gonna have
to teach you everything all over again.

210
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:36,920
Katherine Brewster,
have you sustained injury?

211
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,644
Drop dead, you asshole!

212
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:43,198
I'm unable to comply.

213
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:53,761
Where are you taking me?

214
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:55,999
To a safe location.

215
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:14,403
All right, get off at the next exit.
Let her out.

216
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:17,686
Negative.
Katherine Brewster must be protected.

217
00:38:18,169 --> 00:38:21,320
-I thought they were after me.
-You could not be located.

218
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:25,801
So a T-X was sent back through time
to eliminate your lieutenants.

219
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:30,558
So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

220
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:36,686
No, no.
No, you shouldn't even exist.

221
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:39,283
I mean, we took out Cyberdyne
over 1 0 years ago.

222
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:43,124
-We stopped Judgment Day.
-You only postponed it.

223
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:45,405
Judgment Day is inevitable.

224
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:54,525
I require a cutting tool.

225
00:39:01,169 --> 00:39:03,364
Here, take the wheel.

226
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:09,925
-What are you doing?
-I am powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

227
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:13,240
My primary cell was damaged
by a plasma attack.

228
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:17,368
T-X is designed for extreme combat,
driven by a plasma reactor...

229
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:19,406
...and equipped
with onboard weapons.

230
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:20,843
Its arsenal includes...

231
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:23,477
...nanotechnological transjectors.

232
00:39:23,649 --> 00:39:27,358
-Meaning?
-It can control other machines.

233
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:34,198
Its body chassis is heavily armoured
and hardened to withstand attack.

234
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:38,364
-You'll find a way to destroy her.
-Unlikely.

235
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,640
I'm an obsolete design.

236
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:44,961
T-X is faster, more powerful
and more intelligent.

237
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:47,962
It's a far more effective
killing machine.

238
00:39:48,129 --> 00:39:49,881
Oh, great.

239
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:51,243
That's great.

240
00:39:52,729 --> 00:39:55,289
My presence in this timeline
has been anticipated.

241
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:59,688
T-X is designed to terminate
other cybernetic organisms.

242
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:04,764
So she's an anti-Terminator
Terminator?

243
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:07,681
You've gotta be shitting me.

244
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:11,159
No, I am not shitting you.

245
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:29,842
When ruptured,
the fuel cells become unstable.

246
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:31,563
Relax.

247
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:35,085
-Let me out of here!
-Relax!

248
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:56,608
Man, this is wack.

249
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:59,841
It's been like this for hours.
Every goddamn station.

250
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,208
Hey.

251
00:41:22,609 --> 00:41:25,123
Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

252
00:41:29,169 --> 00:41:30,966
Talk to the hand.

253
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:49,402
Help! Help me!

254
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:51,481
Help!

255
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:57,040
I think we better go.

256
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:29,322
Jerky?

257
00:42:30,169 --> 00:42:32,319
You're kidnapping me.

258
00:42:33,249 --> 00:42:35,524
-Look--
-God, you were always a delinquent.

259
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:39,443
And look at you now, sitting there
like the bad-boy thing still works.

260
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:42,362
What are you,
some kind of gang member?

261
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:44,804
How do you live with yourself?

262
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:48,482
What?

263
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:54,282
Tell her who I am.

264
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:57,009
John Connor is leader
of the Worldwide Resistance...

265
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:59,922
...and last hope of humankind.

266
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:03,718
Right. And him?

267
00:43:04,689 --> 00:43:06,998
He's a robot from the future.

268
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:10,684
Living tissue over a metal skeleton,
sent back in time to protect me.

269
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:12,567
Go to hell.

270
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:15,757
He doesn't mean you any harm.

271
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,920
I have a fiancé.

272
00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:21,159
He's gonna be looking for me.

273
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:23,638
What is it that you want?

274
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:26,802
Just...

275
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:29,281
...imagine...

276
00:43:30,689 --> 00:43:34,682
...if you knew you were gonna do
something important with your life.

277
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:37,044
Something amazing.

278
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:40,919
Maybe the most important thing
anyone has ever done.

279
00:43:41,529 --> 00:43:43,087
But there's a catch.

280
00:43:44,009 --> 00:43:46,569
Something terrible has to happen.

281
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:53,118
You couldn't...

282
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:57,277
...live with yourself if you didn't try
to stop it, but....

283
00:43:57,449 --> 00:43:59,041
What are you talking about?

284
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:04,640
It's just-- The life you know...

285
00:44:04,929 --> 00:44:07,762
...all the stuff that
you take for granted...

286
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:10,367
...it's not gonna last.

287
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:17,888
Mike Kripke.

288
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:21,565
Back there, why did you say
" Kripke's basement"?

289
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:23,242
Because Mike Kripke's house...

290
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:26,606
...that's where the kids used
to go make out, right?

291
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:33,846
So you and me--
Wait, did we...?

292
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:37,524
Holy shit, we did.

293
00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:42,160
We made out in Kripke's basement.
I cannot believe you remembered that.

294
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:47,327
I must have made
some kind of impression.

295
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:48,808
Give me a break.

296
00:44:49,129 --> 00:44:52,360
I only remembered because
the next day you were in the news.

297
00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:02,165
Wait a second. You and me hooked up
the day before I first met him.

298
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:06,167
And now again, 1 0 years later.

299
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:10,363
We were supposed to meet.

300
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:13,480
Coincidence.

301
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:19,921
Yeah.

302
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,162
Hon? Did you just get in?

303
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:08,760
Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D.
This is Detective Bell.

304
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:11,963
We're looking for Katherine Brewster.
Is she here?

305
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:13,278
No.

306
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:17,647
-You're her fiancé, Scott Mason?
-Yes.

307
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:21,518
There was an incident at the
veterinary hospital where she works.

308
00:46:21,689 --> 00:46:24,283
We're concerned something
may have happened to her.

309
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:25,564
Where is she?

310
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:29,040
We got a report from a gas station
attendant near Victorville...

311
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:32,963
...about a possible kidnapping
and it might be related.

312
00:46:33,129 --> 00:46:35,324
I'll help you find her.

313
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:48,487
Come with me.

314
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:54,282
Go.

315
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,687
Your mother?

316
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:27,922
I never even knew
where she was buried.

317
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:33,482
I hit the road the day she died.

318
00:47:37,169 --> 00:47:39,364
Why did you bring me here?

319
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:44,608
No! What are you doing?

320
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:46,248
Hey, stop!

321
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:47,723
Get away from it! Stop!

322
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:57,557
Sarah Connor was cremated
in Mexico.

323
00:47:57,729 --> 00:47:59,924
Her friends scattered her ashes
in the sea.

324
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:03,361
They stored these weapons
in accordance with her will.

325
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:06,242
What happened to her?

326
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:09,606
Leukaemia.

327
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:14,200
I'm sorry.

328
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:19,165
We were living in Baja
when she was diagnosed.

329
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:23,363
They only gave her six months.

330
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:27,241
But she fought for three years.

331
00:48:29,649 --> 00:48:31,765
Long enough to make sure.

332
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:35,645
To make sure?

333
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,404
That the world didn't end.

334
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:48,365
" Every day after this one is a gift."

335
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:51,282
She told me, "We made it. We're free."

336
00:48:54,009 --> 00:48:56,523
But I never really believed that.

337
00:48:59,449 --> 00:49:01,758
I guess she didn't either.

338
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:07,038
You know you were about the closest
thing to a father I ever had?

339
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:09,887
How pathetic is that?

340
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:12,518
Out of my way!

341
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:17,680
My mission is to protect you.

342
00:49:18,529 --> 00:49:19,723
That's enough.

343
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:24,565
Move or I'll do it!
I swear I will! I'll shoot you!

344
00:49:25,409 --> 00:49:27,764
Go ahead. See what happens.

345
00:49:41,929 --> 00:49:43,521
Don't do that.

346
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:47,480
Oh, my God.

347
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:56,560
This is the police.
We have the building surrounded.

348
00:49:56,729 --> 00:49:58,799
Release your hostage!

349
00:50:16,929 --> 00:50:20,524
Just leave me here. I'm not the one
you want. You're wasting your time.

350
00:50:20,689 --> 00:50:24,602
Incorrect. John Connor
leads the Resistance to victory.

351
00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:25,963
How?

352
00:50:26,129 --> 00:50:27,687
Why? Why me?

353
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:29,966
You are John Connor.

354
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:34,448
Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit
since the cradle.

355
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:37,408
Look at me.
I'm no leader, I never was!

356
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:39,560
I'm never gonna--

357
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:44,808
Let go.

358
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,962
You're right.
You're not the one I want.

359
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:50,404
I'm wasting my time.

360
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:56,527
Fuck you, you fucking machine!

361
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:58,768
Better.

362
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:02,880
Oh, you were just dicking with me?

363
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:05,643
Anger is more useful than despair.

364
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:07,322
What?

365
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:10,799
Basic psychology is among
my subroutines.

366
00:51:14,889 --> 00:51:16,880
Perps still holed up?

367
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:18,998
Gotcha.

368
00:51:19,169 --> 00:51:21,603
Good news. Your fiancée's okay.

369
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:22,804
Where is she?

370
00:51:22,969 --> 00:51:25,358
Greenlawn Cemetery,
up off the 5 freeway.

371
00:51:25,569 --> 00:51:29,323
It's right by the desert. But they're
gonna bring her back to the--

372
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:32,638
Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

373
00:52:01,769 --> 00:52:05,079
You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

374
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:08,646
Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.

375
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:12,006
I'm a post-trauma counsellor
for the sheriff's department.

376
00:52:12,169 --> 00:52:14,125
How are you feeling?

377
00:52:14,889 --> 00:52:16,800
He's not human.

378
00:52:17,129 --> 00:52:21,122
He's really not human.

379
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:26,759
I know what it's like to be
in a hostage situation.

380
00:52:26,929 --> 00:52:28,920
I've been there myself.

381
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:32,081
The fear, the adrenaline.

382
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:36,003
You find yourself imagining things.

383
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:38,957
Impossible things.

384
00:52:39,649 --> 00:52:41,765
Crazy things.

385
00:52:42,969 --> 00:52:45,119
Insane things.

386
00:52:47,009 --> 00:52:49,762
Take years to get over it.

387
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:53,284
-Go, go, go!
-Move it!

388
00:52:58,729 --> 00:52:59,957
Drop your weapon!

389
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:05,525
And the coffin!

390
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:10,163
Take him down! Take him down!

391
00:53:49,409 --> 00:53:51,365
Resume fire!

392
00:53:58,129 --> 00:54:00,438
We must reacquire
Katherine Brewster.

393
00:54:01,169 --> 00:54:04,002
Why? What makes her
so goddamn important?

394
00:54:04,169 --> 00:54:06,888
Through her, you contact remnants
of the military...

395
00:54:07,049 --> 00:54:10,883
...and learn how to fight Skynet,
forming the core of the Resistance.

396
00:54:11,049 --> 00:54:13,563
Later,
your children will become important.

397
00:54:14,409 --> 00:54:17,321
-What?
-She's your wife.

398
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,407
Get in!

399
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:17,048
Do you want to live? Come on!

400
00:55:38,489 --> 00:55:41,720
-It was Scott! How could it be Scott?
-Your fiancé?

401
00:55:41,889 --> 00:55:45,723
The T-X is polymimetic, able to take
the form of anything it touches.

402
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:48,440
Your fiancé is dead.

403
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:12,958
Oh, my God!

404
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:19,524
Do something!

405
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:50,881
Get down.

406
00:57:12,489 --> 00:57:14,639
We need a new vehicle.

407
00:58:34,169 --> 00:58:35,648
Hey, come on.

408
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:37,845
We gotta keep moving.

409
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:42,397
She killed Scott because of me.

410
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:51,079
Look, I know this won't help...

411
00:58:53,209 --> 00:58:58,567
...but sometimes things happen
that we just can't change.

412
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:03,848
It's not your fault.

413
00:59:18,649 --> 00:59:20,799
Are you sure about this?

414
00:59:21,569 --> 00:59:22,968
About her and me, I mean.

415
00:59:23,129 --> 00:59:27,566
Your confusion is not rational. She's
a healthy female of breeding age.

416
00:59:27,729 --> 00:59:29,526
There's more to it than that.

417
00:59:29,689 --> 00:59:34,205
My database does not encompass
the dynamics of human pair bonding.

418
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:41,044
So this Terminatrix, how many others
does she have on her hit list?

419
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:45,920
Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth.
Anderson, William.

420
00:59:46,089 --> 00:59:48,728
Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

421
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,083
My father?

422
00:59:50,249 --> 00:59:52,809
Having failed to acquire
its primary target...

423
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:55,085
...T-X will resume its default program.

424
00:59:55,249 --> 00:59:59,162
-She's gonna kill my father too?
-There's a high probability.

425
00:59:59,849 --> 01:00:02,124
-No.
-Who is he? What does he do?

426
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:06,601
He's in the Air Force. Weapon design,
secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

427
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,398
General Robert Brewster
is program director of CRS...

428
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:14,323
...Cyber Research Systems,
autonomous weapons division.

429
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:17,287
Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

430
01:00:17,449 --> 01:00:21,567
Skynet is one of the digital defence
systems developed under Brewster.

431
01:00:21,729 --> 01:00:23,162
Oh, God.

432
01:00:23,529 --> 01:00:26,646
Oh, my God. Of course.

433
01:00:27,009 --> 01:00:28,408
It all makes sense now.

434
01:00:29,249 --> 01:00:32,480
If you hadn't come back when
I was a kid, changed everything...

435
01:00:32,649 --> 01:00:36,608
...we would have gotten together
then. I would have met her father.

436
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:39,278
-Don't you see?
-I don't understand.

437
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:43,203
Your father.
This is all about your father.

438
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:44,961
He's the key. He always was.

439
01:00:45,129 --> 01:00:47,802
Your father is the one
who can shut Skynet down.

440
01:00:49,129 --> 01:00:51,518
He's the only one who ever could.

441
01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:55,399
We have to get to him
before the T-X does.

442
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,878
Negative. I cannot jeopardize
my mission.

443
01:00:58,049 --> 01:00:59,926
This is your mission,
to save people!

444
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:03,843
My mission is to ensure the survival of
John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

445
01:01:04,609 --> 01:01:06,804
I am giving you an order.

446
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:09,437
I am not programmed
to follow your orders.

447
01:01:09,609 --> 01:01:12,567
-After the nuclear war, you both--
-Nuclear war?!

448
01:01:12,729 --> 01:01:15,687
There doesn't have to be a war!
We can stop it!

449
01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:17,919
There is insufficient time.

450
01:01:18,089 --> 01:01:22,082
The first launch sequences
will be initiated at 6: 1 8 p.m.

451
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:23,967
-What, today?
-Affirmative.

452
01:01:24,129 --> 01:01:26,723
John, what is he saying?

453
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,720
Judgment Day.

454
01:01:31,049 --> 01:01:33,119
The end of the world.

455
01:01:34,449 --> 01:01:36,326
It's today, three hours from now.

456
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:38,720
Two hours and 53 minutes.

457
01:01:38,889 --> 01:01:43,758
We must continue south into Mexico
to escape the primary blast zones.

458
01:01:44,489 --> 01:01:47,162
No, we have to get to her dad.

459
01:01:48,769 --> 01:01:52,478
The Mojave area will sustain
significant nuclear fallout.

460
01:01:52,649 --> 01:01:54,241
You will not survive.

461
01:01:55,049 --> 01:01:59,201
You mean we go hide somewhere
in a hole while the bombs fall?

462
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:01,408
It is your destiny.

463
01:02:04,969 --> 01:02:06,687
-Fuck my destiny.
-John.

464
01:02:11,449 --> 01:02:13,201
You cannot self-terminate.

465
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:16,038
No, you can't.
I can do whatever I want.

466
01:02:16,209 --> 01:02:18,882
I'm a human being.
I'm not some goddamn robot.

467
01:02:19,049 --> 01:02:20,801
-Cybernetic organism.
-Whatever!

468
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:23,688
Either we get her father
to shut Skynet down...

469
01:02:23,849 --> 01:02:28,400
...stop this shit from ever happening,
or so much for the great John Connor.

470
01:02:29,089 --> 01:02:33,367
Because your future, my destiny,
I don't want any part of it. I never did.

471
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:38,524
Based on your pupil dilation, skin
temperature and motor functions...

472
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:44,641
...l calculate an 83°/o probability
that you will not pull the trigger.

473
01:02:48,649 --> 01:02:52,801
Please do what he says.
You have to save my father!

474
01:02:56,809 --> 01:03:00,199
We can reach CRS
in approximately one hour...

475
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:03,042
...depending on traffic conditions.

476
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:28,001
I can't get a line.

477
01:03:30,929 --> 01:03:32,681
The whole cell network is down.

478
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:35,682
Skynet is assuming control
over global communications...

479
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:38,079
...in preparation for its attack.

480
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:42,242
So if this war is between people
and machines...

481
01:03:42,529 --> 01:03:44,645
...why are you on our side?

482
01:03:44,809 --> 01:03:48,597
The Resistance captured me
and reprogrammed my CPU.

483
01:03:48,769 --> 01:03:52,125
I was originally designed
for assassination missions.

484
01:03:54,929 --> 01:03:56,408
So...

485
01:03:56,729 --> 01:04:00,438
...you don't really care
if this mission succeeds or not.

486
01:04:00,969 --> 01:04:04,803
If we get killed,
does that mean anything to you?

487
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:08,086
If you were to die,
I will become useless.

488
01:04:08,249 --> 01:04:11,241
There will be no reason for me to exist.

489
01:04:16,649 --> 01:04:18,640
Thank you for doing this.

490
01:04:18,809 --> 01:04:20,720
Your gratitude is not required.

491
01:04:21,409 --> 01:04:23,684
I am programmed
to follow your commands.

492
01:04:24,649 --> 01:04:26,002
Her commands?

493
01:04:26,169 --> 01:04:28,842
Katherine Brewster had
me reactivated...

494
01:04:29,009 --> 01:04:31,318
...and sent through
the time displacement field.

495
01:04:31,489 --> 01:04:34,959
What exactly am I in this
future of yours?

496
01:04:35,129 --> 01:04:38,678
You're John Connor's spouse
and second-in-command.

497
01:04:40,569 --> 01:04:42,366
No, l--

498
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:44,238
What?

499
01:04:46,369 --> 01:04:47,927
You're a mess.

500
01:04:49,449 --> 01:04:53,124
Hey, you're not
exactly my type, either.

501
01:04:54,049 --> 01:04:56,005
Why didn't I send you back?

502
01:04:56,169 --> 01:04:58,364
I am not authorized
to answer your question.

503
01:05:00,049 --> 01:05:03,405
-Why didn't he send you back?
-He was dead.

504
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:09,447
Well, that sucks.

505
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:14,083
-Humans inevitably die.
-Yeah, I know.

506
01:05:14,929 --> 01:05:16,965
So how does it--? No.

507
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:20,082
Maybe I don't want to know.

508
01:05:21,609 --> 01:05:23,042
How does he die?

509
01:05:23,729 --> 01:05:27,358
John Connor was terminated
on July 4th, 2032.

510
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:31,238
I was selected for the emotional
attachment he had for my model...

511
01:05:31,409 --> 01:05:35,527
...due to his boyhood experiences.
This aided in my infiltration.

512
01:05:36,449 --> 01:05:38,007
What are you saying?

513
01:05:39,689 --> 01:05:41,919
I killed you.

514
01:05:53,729 --> 01:05:58,519
This has to be a mistake. As of 1 1 00,
all military systems were secure.

515
01:05:58,689 --> 01:06:02,568
They were. Only the civilian sector
was affected. Internet, air traffic.

516
01:06:02,729 --> 01:06:05,448
Minutes ago, guidance computers
at Vandenberg crashed.

517
01:06:05,609 --> 01:06:08,169
We thought it was an error.
It looks like the virus.

518
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:12,447
-Early warning in Alaska is down.
-Satellite signals are scrambled.

519
01:06:12,609 --> 01:06:15,362
What about the missile silos,
the subs?

520
01:06:16,329 --> 01:06:18,445
We've lost contact.

521
01:06:18,889 --> 01:06:22,199
You're saying this country
is completely open to attack.

522
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:25,088
Theoretically, we could be
under attack already.

523
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:30,448
Who's doing this? A foreign power or
some computer hacker in his garage?

524
01:06:30,609 --> 01:06:32,645
We can't trace the virus
or pin it down.

525
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:36,802
It keeps growing and changing,
like it has a mind of its own.

526
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:39,007
This can't be happening.

527
01:06:39,169 --> 01:06:43,208
The Pentagon's on the secure line.
It's the chairman.

528
01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:48,160
All right.

529
01:07:02,009 --> 01:07:03,840
Look...

530
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:06,046
...none of this is gonna happen.

531
01:07:06,649 --> 01:07:11,848
We get to your dad, get him to pull the
plug on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

532
01:07:14,089 --> 01:07:16,808
He won't have to kill me someday.

533
01:07:17,569 --> 01:07:19,799
He'll never even exist.

534
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:26,529
You and l, we can
just go our separate ways.

535
01:07:31,049 --> 01:07:33,483
You know, Mike Kripke's basement....

536
01:07:36,169 --> 01:07:38,967
That was the first time
I ever kissed a guy.

537
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:41,397
Really?

538
01:07:48,369 --> 01:07:50,405
Your levity is good.

539
01:07:51,049 --> 01:07:54,405
It relieves tension
and the fear of death.

540
01:08:20,409 --> 01:08:22,923
We're hoping you have
a solution for us.

541
01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:26,718
I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready
for a system-wide connection.

542
01:08:26,889 --> 01:08:29,722
That's not what your civilian
counterparts there told me.

543
01:08:29,889 --> 01:08:32,084
They say we can stop
this damn virus.

544
01:08:32,249 --> 01:08:35,605
I understand there's a certain amount
of performance anxiety...

545
01:08:35,769 --> 01:08:38,966
...but your boys say if we plug Skynet
into all of our systems...

546
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:43,042
... it'll squash this thing and give me
back control of my military.

547
01:08:43,209 --> 01:08:45,598
Mr. Chairman, I need
to make myself very clear.

548
01:08:45,769 --> 01:08:49,045
If we uplink now, Skynet will be
in control of your military.

549
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:53,088
But you'll be in control
of Skynet, right?

550
01:08:53,409 --> 01:08:55,445
That is correct, sir.

551
01:08:55,609 --> 01:08:56,928
Then do it.

552
01:08:57,089 --> 01:08:59,728
And, Brewster, if this thing works...

553
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:03,120
...you'll get all the funding
you'll ever need.

554
01:09:04,009 --> 01:09:05,886
Yes, sir.

555
01:10:11,689 --> 01:10:13,247
Sir?

556
01:10:14,409 --> 01:10:16,127
Shall l?

557
01:10:17,609 --> 01:10:19,088
No.

558
01:10:20,169 --> 01:10:22,239
It's my job now.

559
01:10:36,169 --> 01:10:39,047
-Skynet Defence System activated.
-We're in.

560
01:10:39,209 --> 01:10:42,326
We're past the firewalls, local
defence nets, Minutemen, subs.

561
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:46,448
Skynet's fully operational,
processing at 60 teraflops a second.

562
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:50,318
It should take less than a minute
to find the virus and kill it.

563
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:54,122
Let's pray to God this works.

564
01:11:00,129 --> 01:11:01,244
Power failure?

565
01:11:01,409 --> 01:11:03,639
No. I don't know what it is.

566
01:11:14,249 --> 01:11:16,558
What the hell is going on?

567
01:11:16,729 --> 01:11:17,718
Daddy!

568
01:11:18,249 --> 01:11:19,728
What are you doing here?

569
01:11:25,809 --> 01:11:28,482
Daddy! Get away from it!

570
01:11:32,169 --> 01:11:33,602
Watch out!

571
01:11:50,169 --> 01:11:52,000
Daddy, don't move.

572
01:11:56,169 --> 01:11:57,841
She'll be back.

573
01:11:58,449 --> 01:12:00,360
We have to shut down Skynet.

574
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:03,043
Where's the system core?
ln this building?

575
01:12:03,209 --> 01:12:06,884
Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

576
01:12:07,049 --> 01:12:10,041
Skynet is the virus!
It's why everything's falling apart!

577
01:12:10,209 --> 01:12:12,245
Skynet has become self-aware.

578
01:12:12,409 --> 01:12:15,879
In one hour it will initiate
a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

579
01:12:16,049 --> 01:12:17,118
What enemy?

580
01:12:17,689 --> 01:12:19,042
Us!

581
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:20,483
Humans.

582
01:12:29,209 --> 01:12:32,326
Oh, God! It's the machines.
They're starting to take over.

583
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:35,845
My office, on this floor,
we have to get there.

584
01:12:36,969 --> 01:12:39,119
The access codes are in my safe.

585
01:13:54,689 --> 01:13:58,602
-Why are they killing everyone?
-To destroy any threat to Skynet.

586
01:13:58,769 --> 01:14:00,487
Which ones are the codes?

587
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:02,401
Red envelope.

588
01:14:06,049 --> 01:14:09,724
Crystal Peak. You have
to get to Crystal Peak.

589
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:11,959
-What is he saying?
-Crystal Peak.

590
01:14:12,129 --> 01:14:14,689
A hardened facility
in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

591
01:14:14,849 --> 01:14:18,444
Fifty-two miles northeast,
bearing 0.5 degrees.

592
01:14:18,609 --> 01:14:20,247
That's the system core?

593
01:14:20,809 --> 01:14:22,845
It's your only chance.

594
01:14:23,009 --> 01:14:27,764
You'll need a plane. The particle
accelerator leads to the runway.

595
01:14:29,689 --> 01:14:31,361
Take care of my daughter.

596
01:14:33,689 --> 01:14:36,965
Oh, Katie, I am sorry.

597
01:14:37,129 --> 01:14:40,280
I opened Pandora's box.

598
01:14:41,369 --> 01:14:42,358
Get down!

599
01:14:58,089 --> 01:15:00,364
There's nothing you can do. Come on.

600
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,565
We must go. It is not safe here.

601
01:15:03,289 --> 01:15:05,644
Kate, we have to go.

602
01:15:05,809 --> 01:15:09,358
Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

603
01:15:09,609 --> 01:15:13,568
He wanted us to shut Skynet down.
Come on.

604
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:16,648
Come on.

605
01:15:28,129 --> 01:15:29,687
Run!

606
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,962
Let's go.

607
01:18:10,409 --> 01:18:13,162
That's it. We can follow it
out to the runway.

608
01:18:13,329 --> 01:18:15,001
Come on.

609
01:19:09,529 --> 01:19:10,518
What?

610
01:19:11,769 --> 01:19:13,441
Nothing.

611
01:19:14,409 --> 01:19:16,525
You remind me of my mother.

612
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:35,524
Oh, God. She's coming.

613
01:19:38,969 --> 01:19:40,766
What are you doing?

614
01:19:41,769 --> 01:19:42,804
Powering up.

615
01:19:47,769 --> 01:19:48,838
Come on.

616
01:20:56,569 --> 01:20:57,888
It's working.

617
01:21:02,329 --> 01:21:04,797
Just die, you bitch!

618
01:21:08,369 --> 01:21:10,041
Come on.

619
01:22:23,089 --> 01:22:25,808
There's my father's plane.
I trained on it.

620
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:38,519
Yes! He made it.

621
01:22:40,409 --> 01:22:42,320
Get away from me.

622
01:22:44,689 --> 01:22:45,678
Leave!

623
01:22:47,369 --> 01:22:48,438
Now!

624
01:22:48,849 --> 01:22:49,998
Let's go!

625
01:22:54,729 --> 01:22:57,721
-The master's on. Throttle's set.
-Come on. Let's go.

626
01:23:03,489 --> 01:23:06,401
Oh, please. You can't do this.

627
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:08,127
I have no choice.

628
01:23:08,969 --> 01:23:11,244
The T-X...

629
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:13,759
...has corrupted my system.

630
01:23:17,289 --> 01:23:20,201
You can't kill a human being.
You said so yourself.

631
01:23:20,369 --> 01:23:22,121
Let him go!

632
01:23:26,609 --> 01:23:28,327
You're fighting it right now.

633
01:23:29,169 --> 01:23:31,205
My CPU is intact.

634
01:23:31,729 --> 01:23:35,358
But I cannot control
my other functions.

635
01:23:35,529 --> 01:23:39,044
You don't have to do this.
You don't want to do this!

636
01:23:39,529 --> 01:23:43,363
Desire is irrelevant.

637
01:23:43,529 --> 01:23:45,997
I am a machine.

638
01:24:01,929 --> 01:24:03,521
What is your mission?

639
01:24:05,169 --> 01:24:08,605
To ensure the survival
of John Connor...

640
01:24:08,769 --> 01:24:10,725
...and Katherine Brewster.

641
01:24:15,849 --> 01:24:18,886
You are about to fail that mission!

642
01:24:25,489 --> 01:24:28,162
I can-- I cannot.

643
01:24:29,249 --> 01:24:31,285
You know what you have to do.

644
01:24:33,169 --> 01:24:35,637
You know my destiny.

645
01:24:40,089 --> 01:24:41,204
I have to live.

646
01:25:20,249 --> 01:25:22,683
-Are you okay?
-What happened?

647
01:25:22,849 --> 01:25:25,363
He couldn't do it.
He shut himself down.

648
01:25:28,969 --> 01:25:31,437
-Can you fly?
-Yeah.

649
01:25:57,729 --> 01:25:59,845
Okay. 01 5 degrees...

650
01:26:00,009 --> 01:26:04,048
...52 miles, our max air speed
is about 1 60.

651
01:26:04,209 --> 01:26:06,518
We've got 32 minutes.

652
01:26:06,689 --> 01:26:08,441
It's just you and me now.

653
01:26:08,609 --> 01:26:10,964
What if we can't stop it?

654
01:26:11,529 --> 01:26:15,044
There's enough C-4 here
to take out 1 0 supercomputers.

655
01:26:15,449 --> 01:26:17,679
We're gonna make it, Kate.

656
01:26:18,849 --> 01:26:21,124
The future is up to us.

657
01:26:27,289 --> 01:26:29,439
That's gotta be it.

658
01:27:30,009 --> 01:27:32,967
Skynet. There may be more of them.

659
01:27:50,089 --> 01:27:51,841
Come on.

660
01:28:05,449 --> 01:28:08,521
I think this is some kind of blast door.

661
01:28:11,529 --> 01:28:14,089
There's no way
we can blow through this thing.

662
01:28:15,249 --> 01:28:16,238
John, look.

663
01:28:19,089 --> 01:28:20,488
Now what?

664
01:28:23,209 --> 01:28:25,439
It's a code prompt.

665
01:28:32,289 --> 01:28:35,201
Type in " Dakota 775."

666
01:28:40,169 --> 01:28:41,443
" Red 1 76."

667
01:29:01,609 --> 01:29:03,839
Come on!
We gotta get this thing open.

668
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:05,841
Here. It's "Avalon 41 2."

669
01:29:06,729 --> 01:29:08,003
Put it in!

670
01:29:40,969 --> 01:29:42,322
Come on!

671
01:29:58,169 --> 01:29:59,602
I'm back.

672
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,479
Go! Now!

673
01:30:17,009 --> 01:30:17,998
Come on!

674
01:30:40,169 --> 01:30:42,399
-Thank you.
-We'll meet again.

675
01:30:42,649 --> 01:30:43,764
Go!

676
01:30:44,849 --> 01:30:45,838
Come on!

677
01:31:28,609 --> 01:31:30,088
You are terminated.

678
01:32:00,969 --> 01:32:02,243
The elevator.

679
01:32:08,569 --> 01:32:10,878
I'll set the detonator for five minutes.

680
01:32:11,369 --> 01:32:13,678
That should give us enough time
to get back up.

681
01:32:43,769 --> 01:32:45,441
What is this place?

682
01:33:24,489 --> 01:33:26,878
These computers are 30 years old.

683
01:33:35,049 --> 01:33:36,801
This isn't Skynet.

684
01:33:41,289 --> 01:33:43,041
There's nothing here.

685
01:33:48,009 --> 01:33:50,728
This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.

686
01:33:52,489 --> 01:33:54,719
Only they never got the warning.

687
01:33:59,209 --> 01:34:00,801
Goddamn it!

688
01:34:03,049 --> 01:34:05,438
There's nothing here!

689
01:34:24,169 --> 01:34:25,921
Why didn't he tell us?

690
01:34:29,129 --> 01:34:31,438
Why did he lead us down here?

691
01:34:36,969 --> 01:34:38,561
To live.

692
01:34:39,689 --> 01:34:41,600
That was his mission.

693
01:34:54,889 --> 01:34:56,959
There was never any stopping it.

694
01:35:00,489 --> 01:35:01,763
John...

695
01:35:03,049 --> 01:35:04,641
...we could just...

696
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:06,723
...let it go.

697
01:35:09,449 --> 01:35:10,723
Hello?

698
01:35:11,489 --> 01:35:13,605
Hello? Can somebody hear me?

699
01:35:14,649 --> 01:35:16,401
This is Montana Civil Defence.

700
01:35:17,929 --> 01:35:19,999
Somebody please come in.

701
01:35:20,489 --> 01:35:22,081
Is there anybody there?

702
01:35:22,409 --> 01:35:25,287
Anyone reading me? Over.

703
01:35:26,409 --> 01:35:28,161
Rumours about a launch sequence.

704
01:35:28,329 --> 01:35:30,479
Command and control
have broken down.

705
01:35:31,689 --> 01:35:34,647
Is anyone receiving me?
Somebody?

706
01:35:36,649 --> 01:35:38,560
Somebody please come in.

707
01:35:38,969 --> 01:35:40,243
Anybody out there?

708
01:35:40,489 --> 01:35:43,686
-SAC Nellis. We're under attack.
-CQ? CQ?

709
01:35:43,929 --> 01:35:45,442
Is anybody there?

710
01:35:47,369 --> 01:35:50,884
This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

711
01:35:51,769 --> 01:35:56,320
Connor? What the hell is happening?
Who's in charge there?

712
01:36:02,889 --> 01:36:04,163
I am.

713
01:36:05,449 --> 01:36:07,679
Connor, can you help us?

714
01:36:08,009 --> 01:36:12,639
This is Montana Civil Defence.
Where did you say you were again?

715
01:36:15,849 --> 01:36:18,568
By the time Skynet
became self-aware...

716
01:36:18,889 --> 01:36:23,041
... it had spread into millions of
computer servers across the planet.

717
01:36:23,769 --> 01:36:28,479
Ordinary computers in office
buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere.

718
01:36:30,249 --> 01:36:33,764
It was software in cyberspace.

719
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:39,519
There was no system core.
It could not be shut down.

720
01:36:40,809 --> 01:36:45,599
The attack began at 6.:18 p.m.,
just as he said it would.

721
01:36:46,569 --> 01:36:48,161
Judgment Day.

722
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:51,358
The day the human race
was nearly destroyed...

723
01:36:51,529 --> 01:36:54,168
...by weapons they'd built
to protect themselves.

724
01:36:56,649 --> 01:37:01,439
I should have realized our destiny
was never to stop Judgment Day.

725
01:37:02,409 --> 01:37:04,798
It was merely to survive it...

726
01:37:05,449 --> 01:37:07,485
... together.

727
01:37:10,729 --> 01:37:12,481
The Terminator knew.

728
01:37:12,969 --> 01:37:15,358
He tried to tell us...

729
01:37:16,169 --> 01:37:18,729
...but I didn't want to hear it.

730
01:37:20,969 --> 01:37:24,803
Maybe the future has been written.
I don't know.

731
01:37:25,769 --> 01:37:28,329
All I know is what
the Terminator taught me.:

732
01:37:28,969 --> 01:37:31,199
Never stop fighting.

733
01:37:31,369 --> 01:37:33,929
And I never will.

734
01:37:35,849 --> 01:37:39,637
The battle has just begun.
