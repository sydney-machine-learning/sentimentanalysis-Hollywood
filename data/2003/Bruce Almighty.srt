1
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,900
Ally, can we get a recap?
You remember the Kowolskis.

2
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,020
They've owned this shop for 30 years,
and they are attempting to set a record...

3
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,700
by making Buffalo's largest
cookie, and you have to wear this.

4
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,620
A hair net? Health department.

5
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,940
You're kidding me. If you're
around the cookie, you have to have it on.

6
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,620
It's the law. I just did
the hair. The hair is perfect.

7
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,180
All right. Give it to me.

8
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,620
God, why do you hate
me? We're rolling.

9
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,780
And speed.

10
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,621
For three decades, the
Kowolski family bakery...

11
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,340
has been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo...

12
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,340
known for their sinfully sweet,
cream-filled Polski pierogis...

13
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,980
and the occasional
sugar-induced coma that follows.

14
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,900
But today, in honor of
their 30th anniversary,

15
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,140
they've invited us to ride along
as they go for the record...

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,220
on Buffalo's biggest cookie.

17
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,860
Vol. Vol. You need a
tissue or something?

18
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,460
Can we get Vol a tissue or a spoon?

19
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,780
It's a good thing we're wearing these today,
'cause I wouldn't want any stray hairs...

20
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,700
to fall into the booger.

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,500
Are we gonna do this again?
No. We can cut to B-roll.

22
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,940
- Moving on!
- So tell me, Mama. 
Why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

23
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,540
Well, man from health department...

24
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,740
say he find rat pellet in
our pastry, but I say, "No.

25
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,380
Is big chocolate sprinkle."
But he shut store down.

26
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,500
So we clean up, make big cookie...

27
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,260
for to bring customers back.

28
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,020
Well, I admire your candor.
Let's try that again, shall we?

29
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,700
So tell me, Mama. Why make
Buffalo's biggest cookie?

30
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,140
So the children of the
neighborhood will be happy?

31
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,820
That's right. It must be wonderful
seeing the smiles on their little faces.

32
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,780
I work in back. I see no smiles.

33
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,500
The previous Buffalo
record was eight feet, seven inches,

34
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,420
baked by Gladys Pelsnick.

35
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,420
If this cookie beats Gladys's,
it will prove once and for all...

36
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,740
that the Kowolskis have
much more free time.

37
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,380
And the cookie is 10 feet, four inches.

38
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,060
We have a new record!

39
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,620
Cue the cheesy inspirational music!

40
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,700
But what are we really looking at here?

41
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,620
Is it just a big cookie, or does this
cookie represent the pride of Buffalo,

42
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,300
its dedicated and hardworking
citizens the key ingredient...

43
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,020
with a few nuts thrown in...

44
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,380
and, finally, the love of our families,

45
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,740
which provides the warm, chewy center,

46
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,020
making our beloved Buffalo
the sweetest place to live.

47
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,980
And that's the way the cookie crumbles.

48
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,780
I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness
News. And cut it.

49
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,900
What do you think?

50
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,820
I think it's really good. It sucks.

51
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,660
It's a story about a cookie.

52
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,980
The Pillsbury Doughboy
will be riveted. Ohh.

53
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,100
Honey, it was
funny. It made me laugh.

54
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,340
There's nothing wrong
with makin' people laugh.

55
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,380
I'll never be an
anchorman, not with this.

56
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,020
The job's right there, but I can't reach it,
because every time they make me do this stuff,

57
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,820
I have to act like a total
goof in order to make it work.

58
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,180
I have no credibility. Not good. Not good.

59
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,580
You know what? Now you're just
sounding silly. Know what? Forget it.

60
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,740
It's not important,
right? It's not important.

61
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,900
- Let's watch it one more time.
- Oh, no.

62
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,660
- Just once more. Please?
- No. No. Bruce, you promised you would help with this album.

63
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,940
Now, you get your goofy butt over here.

64
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,460
Uh-uh.

65
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,740
Okay.

66
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,220
Okay. Okay. Now, you just
go through this stack,

67
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,300
and you pick your favorites.

68
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,980
Oh, come on. This is fun.
Right? Isn't this fun?

69
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,340
This is nice.

70
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,300
Evan's gonna get that
anchor job; I just know it.

71
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,220
Ah, Bruce! He's the favorite.

72
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,380
All right. You know what? Just
forget it. Let's just forget it.

73
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,780
This is just our life. We can always
just have some kid do it for us.

74
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,900
Whoa! Hold the phone! I like
this one. Our weekend at the lake.

75
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,180
How did you get that? That's
supposed to be in our private stash.

76
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,540
You look perky, hon. It must've been
cold. All right. Just give it to me.

77
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,540
I think I'll put this on my computer
and use it as wallpaper. No, no, no.

78
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,740
Okay. Give it to me.
Come on! No, no, no.

79
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,420
All right. Fine. Do with it
what you will. I don't care.

80
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,780
- I will do with it what I will.
- Jesus.

81
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,380
You know, I might even
send this in to Playboy.

82
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,140
I hear their layouts can be quite
tasteful. Give that to me right now!

83
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,100
- Jesus. - Right
now! - Ow! Rough stuff!

84
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,140
I'm gonna hurt you...

85
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,220
Sweetie? Time to get up.

86
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,020
Uh-uh.

87
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Good dream. No. Uh-uh. No.

88
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,660
Well, the Buffalo Sabres
lost again last night...

89
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,620
at the hands of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

90
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,740
It was a shootout on the ice for our
hometown... Of course. They're my team.

91
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,020
And that's the way the cookie crumbles. You
know, I think there might be something...

92
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,980
to this cookie line.

93
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,780
All the greatest anchors have
had their own signature sign-off,

94
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,540
like Wal-ter
Cron-kite.

95
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,900
And that's the way it
was. That's the way the cookie crumbles.

96
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,500
And that's the way,
uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it,

97
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,100
uh-huh, uh-huh.

98
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,740
Oh, no. Grace, the dog!

99
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,020
I'm in the shower!

100
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,620
No, Sam! Bad dog!

101
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,060
Inside, bad. Outside, good.

102
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,300
Inside, bad. Outside, good.

103
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,340
Oh, you're done now.

104
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,580
Great.

105
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,060
B-E-A-utiful.

106
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,740
Come on. Let's go back inside and have a shit.

107
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,060
- What is the deal-io? -
We are having a blood drive.

108
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,020
Creepy. Needles. Yuck.

109
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,180
Well, they need my blood. I
have a very rare blood type.

110
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,380
I'm A.B. - Positive. Really?

111
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,380
Mm-hmm. I'm
I.B. - Positive.

112
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,820
I be positive they ain't touchin'
me with no needle. It's just so...

113
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,460
Helpful and lifesaving? No.
It's your blood. It's blood.

114
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,180
Blood's supposed to stay inside the
body. That's where it's meant to be.

115
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,860
Besides, they stockpile this
stuff in a warehouse somewhere.

116
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,380
It's all frozen on ice, and they
tell everybody there's a shortage.

117
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,980
That's just not true.
Where did you hear that?

118
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,260
From a very reliable friend
of a friend of a girl...

119
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,460
whose sister's going out with someone
very high up in the government.

120
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,380
But for your own protection, I cannot discuss
it at this time. Now, get out before they see us.

121
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,820
Oh, no.

122
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,780
Oh. Here. Hold on a second.
You need these more than I do.

123
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,140
What is these? Prayer beads.

124
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,980
The kids made 'em for me.
They will keep you safe.

125
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,300
I hope they're powerful. I'm gonna need
a friggin' miracle to get to work on time.

126
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,660
This isn't happening. Not
now. Not during sweeps week.

127
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,780
Not during sweeps week!

128
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,540
Oh, God.

129
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,820
Yeah. Yeah. Meeting's
started without me.

130
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,780
This is my luck. This is my luck!

131
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,420
Shit.

132
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,460
Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

133
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,900
Jesus. Get out of there!

134
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,460
"REwe Blind." No, but I'm late.

135
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,020
Is your child in dire jeopardy?

136
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,820
- Find out tonight after the game.
- Okay. Promos are approved.

137
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,500
Uh, Jack, shouldn't we be focusing
on Pete's retirement? Now, let's...

138
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,940
- I mean, this is his last week.
- Yeah, Jack. Any word on the open anchor position?

139
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,220
Evan, when I know something, you'll
know something.

140
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,380
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was...

141
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,380
Did you guys already play the
spots? It's a nice story, Bruce,

142
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,340
but we're gonna go with Evan's piece... sex
scandal in the mayor's office... for sweeps.

143
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,580
Oh, yeah. Sweeps.

144
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,380
And that's the
way the cookie crumbles.

145
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,860
I'm just
messing with you, Bruce.

146
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,060
See, you just gotta
remember that the newsroom...

147
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,300
is like a big cookie.

148
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,940
Do you like jazz, Evan? Yeah.

149
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,220
Let me play something for
ya.

150
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,100
I can hold that note all day,
buddy. Knock it off, guys.

151
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,860
Bruce, we're gonna keep your story in
reserve. Now, can we get back to the board...

152
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,820
so we'll have something
to put on the air today?

153
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,940
Great choice, Jack. This
is the Cadillac of bolognas.

154
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,460
Okay. Thanks. Jack,
can I talk to you a second?

155
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,700
Yeah. Sure, Bruce. What
do you need? Sweeps.

156
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,700
Bruce. Jack. Jack! Hear me out here.

157
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,260
I'm startin' to get desperate, man. I'm
pushin' 40, and what have I got to show for it?

158
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,420
I've hit some kind of a ceiling here. There's
an anti-Bruce barrier I can't get past.

159
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,060
And Evan is lovin' it, by the way.

160
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,220
Lovin' it. He gets the stories. He gets on
sweeps. Maybe I should be more like Evan.

161
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,140
You don't wanna be like
Evan. Evan's an asshole.

162
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,820
I can be an asshole.
No, Bruce. You can't.

163
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,620
You gonna pick that up?
Yeah. I'm sorry. It's...

164
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,780
I'm losin' it. It's just this whole
anchor thing opening up has got me nuts.

165
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,540
Hi, Susan. Hi, Susan. Hi, Jack.

166
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,500
Look, Bruce. You're a good
reporter. You make people laugh.

167
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,980
All right. I'll tell you what. Today is the
156th anniversary of the Maid of the Mist.

168
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,780
I want you at Niagara Falls
in an hour. Maid of the Mist?

169
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,660
That's always live. Mm-hmm.

170
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,980
But Evan always does live feeds.
Now you and Evan get the live feeds.

171
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,100
I'm going live? During sweeps?
Mm-hmm. But watch your step.

172
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,180
I've seen your outtakes.
Jack, you will not regret this.

173
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,740
And I won't forget you when
I go national. Uh, can you...

174
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,100
Thanks, pal.
Can I have your wish now?

175
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,540
I'm gonna put it in
the wish jar. Thank you.

176
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,020
- Okay. Put your wish in there.
- Me too.

177
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,420
Put your wish in there.
Look at that. Looks like a big wish.

178
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,580
Oh, no, no. Oh, no. Martin, don't...
don't eat that. Don't eat that.

179
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,540
Don't put that in your mouth.
That's paste, honey. Ooh.

180
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,460
- That must've tasted awful.
- Mommy!

181
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,220
Oh, Zoe-Baboey! Did you have
a good time with Aunt Crazy today?

182
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,860
Mm-hmm. Yeah? See how nice
this is? Baby on the hip?

183
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,380
Oh, it's amazing. You've become
Mom. The transformation is complete.

184
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,780
Oh. I'll get it.

185
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,780
- Small Wonders Day Care.
- Grace? - No. It's Debbie,

186
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,740
the sister whose life
you're not wasting.

187
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,860
Oh, all right. Okay, okay,
okay. Bye, Debbie!

188
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,940
Oops. Hi. Hi. Sorry.

189
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,980
Debbie forgot to take her
meds today. Where are ya?

190
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,500
Oh, a little place called the winner's
circle. I'm at the falls doing a live report.

191
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,700
- Live? That's great!
- Yeah! It's happening, hon. I got sweeps, and I'm live.

192
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,020
You know what that means? They're
seein' if I can think on my feet,

193
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,860
you know, like I might have to do
in a live news anchor situation.

194
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,020
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah. It's what we've always talked about, Grace.

195
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,620
- Jack practically came out and told me.
- Practically?

196
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,500
Well, he didn't spell it
out, but legally, he can't.

197
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,980
But this is exactly what happened to Susan
Ortega just before they bumped her up.

198
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,060
It's good. It's good.
It's good.

199
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,100
Okay. Well, honey, I just don't... I don't
want you to get too ahead of yourself.

200
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,420
Bruce? Oh, I gotta go.
They're callin' me in.

201
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,420
Oh. Okay, honey. Good luck. I love you.

202
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,740
Love, love, love, love, love.

203
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,740
Let's do it.

204
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,940
They want you close
to the falls. Really?

205
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,340
- I'm gonna get soaked.
- That's the point. They want you to put this on.

206
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,300
Part of the condition of
us getting the exclusive.

207
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,140
You know what? Nothin' can
bother me today. Nothin'.

208
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,020
Okay. Now, remember. It's their
156th-year anniversary. Mm-hmm.

209
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,300
149 capacity. Right.

210
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,740
They cater to tourists, honeymooners...
And people insanely thirsty.

211
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,380
I get it. Okay. And you are gonna
be interviewing Irene Dansfield.

212
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,300
Irene! Pleasure to meet you. Truly.

213
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,340
You look beautiful. Irene's
mother rode on the maiden voyage.

214
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,540
Wow. Rub that in my face,
why don't ya? Ninety seconds!

215
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,420
Ninety seconds? Holy hell. Uh,
yeah. Okay. Ninety seconds? Whoo.

216
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,020
Because of the fast response, the toxic
chemicals were cleaned up without incident.

217
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,100
- Susan?
- Bruce Nolan is standing by at Niagara Falls,

218
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,580
but before we go live to Bruce,
we have an announcement to make.

219
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,420
As everyone knows, after 33 years,

220
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,100
our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.

221
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,980
Pete's shoes are virtually impossible to fill,

222
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,220
But the show must go on, and we
could think of no one better...

223
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,580
than our very own Evan Baxter.

224
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,020
Ohh... Oh, boy.

225
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,980
- Congratulations, Evan.
- Thanks, Susan. I'm thrilled and honored.

226
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,580
And as you said, no one can replace the
great Pete Fineman, but I will do my best.

227
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,180
I have to say, I am so proud to be a
part of our local community of Buffalo,

228
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,180
and I think, in a lot of ways, a great
city is like a great recipe, really.

229
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,660
You take hardworking
citizens, add some caregivers,

230
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,780
maybe a few nuts,

231
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,220
All sprinkled with
the love and support of good families.

232
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,100
Ultimately, that makes
one sweet place to live.

233
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,100
- That was amazing.
- I meant it.

234
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,700
- I wish I'd written something.
- And now let's go live...

235
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,300
to that wacky Bruce Nolan
out at Niagara Falls.

236
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,060
Hey! Wacky Bruce!

237
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,780
Bruce? Talk, Bruce. Hello?

238
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,300
- Talk, honey. Talk.
- What's going on?

239
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,660
- We got a Walt Disney. - He's frozen
solid. - We may not have audio. Check.

240
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,740
- We may be having a bit of technical difficulty.
- Feed's good, Jack.

241
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,580
Move. Come on. Come on. Come
on. Talk, Bruce, damn it!

242
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,740
- All right. Get ready to pull the plug.
- Come on, baby. Say something.

243
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,100
- Say something.
- Bruce, talk.

244
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,620
- Hi, Susan.
- Oh, thank you, God.

245
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,580
Bruce Nolan here aboard the Maid of
the Mist in fabulous Niagara Falls.

246
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,300
First off, let me just add another
congratulations to Evan Backstabber...

247
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,900
Pardon me. Bastard. Baxter, rather. It is
good to see what someone with talent can do...

248
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,820
when great opportunities are given to
them instead of me.

249
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,700
Anyway, I'm here with
Katharine Hepburn's mom.

250
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,380
Tell me. Why did you throw the blue Heart of
the Ocean jewel over the railing of the Titanic?

251
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,980
Did you feel bad at all letting Leo DiCaprio
drown while you were safe, floating on the door?

252
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,900
Could you have taken turns, or were you just
too afraid to freeze your big, fat ass off?

253
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,260
Hmm. I guess that's how life is, isn't it?

254
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,740
Some people are drenched, freezing
to death on a stupid boat...

255
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,420
with a stupid hat, while others are in a
comfy news studio, suckin' up all the glory.

256
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,220
- Oh, well. No big deal.
- Oh, boy.

257
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,980
Oh, look. It's the owner
of the Maid of the Mist.

258
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,260
Let's have a talk with him, shall we?
Come on in here, Bill. That's all right.

259
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,220
No, no, no, no. No, no.
Come on. Let's have a talk.

260
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,300
Come on. What are you doing?

261
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,380
Bill, you've been running the Maid
of the Mist for 23 years now. Tell me.

262
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,900
Why do you think I didn't get the anchor
job? Hey, man. I don't want problems.

263
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,540
Is it my hair, Bill? Are
my teeth not white enough?

264
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,820
Or like the great falls,
is the bedrock of my life...

265
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,420
eroding beneath me?

266
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,420
Eroding! Eroding! Eroding!

267
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,220
Cut the feed. Go to black.

268
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,980
Go to black. I'm on it.

269
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,820
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness
News. Back to you, fuckers!

270
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,100
Oh, boy. - Oh, my God.

271
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:53,460
That is perfect. That is
the motivation that I needed!

272
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,740
Right there! Thank you.

273
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,060
Thank you, W.K.B. W!

274
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,060
Wimpy Kitty Baby Whiners!

275
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,020
That's what that stands for!

276
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,460
I'll see you on Channel 5,
where they do the real news.

277
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,900
Do I look blind to you? Do I look blind to you?

278
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,900
- Hey.
- Let's go, man. Come on. Let's go.

279
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,660
What are you doing over there?
Come on. Leave the poor guy alone.

280
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,580
You okay, man?

281
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,740
Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'.

282
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,660
What? What'd you say, ese?

283
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,980
Run, man! Run! Oh, God!

284
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,780
Okay, okay, okay! I didn't
mean it! I was just kiddin'!

285
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,340
Hey, you forgot your things.

286
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,180
Say somethin' to that. Say somethin'.

287
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,420
B-E-A...

288
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,420
utiful.

289
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,740
That's what I get...

290
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,340
That's what I
get for trying to help someone.

291
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,860
Oh, don't look at me, Walter.

292
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,780
Oh, no!

293
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,980
Well, that's
my payment, I guess.

294
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,020
That... That is my reward.

295
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,420
Just? Just get a clue!

296
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,500
Thank God you're all right.
Yeah. Let's thank God.

297
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,180
For his blessings are
raining down upon me.

298
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,060
- Wait! That's not rain!
- Bruce, please don't do that, honey.

299
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,180
You know that everything
happens for a reason.

300
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,180
That I don't need. That is a
cliche. That is not helpful to me.

301
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,260
A bird in
the hand is worth two in the bush.

302
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,100
I have no bird. I have no bush.
God has taken my bird and my bush.

303
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,700
Oh, I see. So God is picking on
you, is that what you're saying?

304
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,940
No. He's ignoring me completely.

305
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,180
He's far too busy giving Evan everything he wants.

306
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,220
Oh, that's great, Sam, but you
missed your target. I'm over here!

307
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,020
Don't get mad at the dog.
It's not the dog's fault.

308
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,740
No. It's God's fault. I gave
him the wrong coordinates.

309
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,780
All right. You know what? Enough. All
right? Will you stop being such a martyr?

310
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,260
I am not being a martyr. I'm a victim.

311
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,020
God is a mean kid sitting on an anthill
with a magnifying glass, and I'm the ant.

312
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,300
He could fix my life in
five minutes if he wanted to,

313
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,580
but he'd rather burn off my
feelers and watch me squirm!

314
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,940
Sweetheart, I know you're
mad. It's understandable.

315
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,340
What Evan did is slimy and wrong,

316
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,780
but this day could've
been so much worse.

317
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,260
I'm just glad you're okay.
Okay? News flash! I'm not okay.

318
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,660
I'm not okay with a mediocre job! I'm
not okay with a mediocre apartment.

319
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,980
I'm not okay with a mediocre life!

320
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,100
So is that what you think
that we have? A mediocre life?

321
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,020
- Don't make this about you.
- About me? How could I make this about me?

322
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,980
It's about you! It's always about you!

323
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,740
Perfect. Perfect.

324
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,420
I'll have the worst day of my life
with a side order of guilt, please!

325
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,940
Oh.

326
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,740
Okay, God. You
want me to talk to you?

327
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,100
Then talk back. Tell me what's going on.

328
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,900
What should I do? Give me a signal.

329
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,060
Oh, I need your guidance,
Lord. Please send me a sign.

330
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,180
Ah, what's this joker doin' now?

331
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,020
Okay. All right. I'll try it your way.

332
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,340
All right. Lord, I need a miracle.

333
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,500
I'm desperate. I need your help, Lord.

334
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,620
Please reach into my life. Hey!

335
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,620
What the he... I got ya!

336
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,580
Ha-ha!

337
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,100
Hey!

338
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,580
Fine! The gloves are off, pal!

339
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,260
Come on! Let me see a little wrath.

340
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,540
Smite me, O mighty smiter!

341
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,220
You're the one who should be fired!

342
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,100
The only one around here
not doing his job is you!

343
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,420
Answer me!

344
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,900
Sorry. Don't know ya.

345
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,140
Wouldn't call you if I did.

346
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,540
Ohh.

347
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,740
Oh, God. Ohh.

348
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,860
Hello

349
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,820
Oh, no!

350
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,180
Sam, this has gotta stop.

351
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,460
All right. Now, get it straight here.

352
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,380
That's the house. This is
the bathroom. House. Bathroom.

353
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,700
Bathroom. House. House.
Bathroom. Bathroom. House.

354
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,340
What's the point?

355
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,900
Denied that
promotion at work? Is life unfair?

356
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,900
Is there someone less talented
than you reaping all the benefits?

357
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,820
Is your name Bruce? Then
do we have the job for you.

358
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,900
We're located at 7725623rd Street.

359
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,180
So come on down, or we'll
just keep beeping you.

360
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,380
"Omni Presents."

361
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,180
Oh, yeah. The glass is half full.

362
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,300
Oh, geez!

363
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,420
Come on! Look! What is that?

364
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,540
What is that?

365
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,140
Ah, geez! Thank you. Thank you again.

366
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,980
What the...

367
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,420
You're looking for Room 7.

368
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,140
Yeah. I figured.

369
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,220
You want me to even those up for you?

370
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,460
How
do I get to Room 7?

371
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,460
That'll be on the seventh floor.
Stairs are right over there.

372
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,700
- I'd rather take the elevator.
- Out of order.

373
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,660
I love the stairs though.
They were my second choice.

374
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,380
Do you mind giving me
a hand with this floor?

375
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,660
What? That's good.

376
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,500
Are you serious? Oh,
uh, I'm kind of busy.

377
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,460
- Um, rain check.
- I'll hold you to it.

378
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,100
I'm free on the seventh at 7:00.

379
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,020
Seventh at 7:00 it is.

380
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,060
This looks promising.

381
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,900
Hello? Another "hugantic,"

382
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,580
"ginormic" waste of my life.

383
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,100
Hello?

384
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,700
Yo! I'm lookin' for whoever runs
this joint. Be right with you.

385
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,460
I'm trying to fix a light.
Tell me if it's working.

386
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,700
Yeah. Seems to be.

387
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,180
Kind ofbright, though.
Yeah. It is for most people.

388
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,180
Spend their lives in the
dark trying to hide from me.

389
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,820
Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?

390
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,820
Yeah, but I'll get around to it.

391
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,100
You install the Clapper? No,
but catchy jingle, isn't it?

392
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,700
"Clap on, clap off"

393
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,060
"Clap on, clap off the Clapper"

394
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Just can't get it out of my head.

395
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,380
Good luck with that. I'm gonna go now.

396
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,580
Okay. But the boss'll be right out.

397
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,380
You must be Bruce.
I've been expecting you.

398
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,660
This is hilarious. So you're the boss
and the electrician and the janitor?

399
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,740
Must be a killer Christmas party.
Don't get drunk, though.

400
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,380
One of you might need a ride home.

401
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,060
You always were funny,
Bruce, just like your father.

402
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,940
He didn't mind rolling up
his sleeves, either, son.

403
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,540
People underestimate the
benefit of good old manual labor.

404
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,780
There's freedom in it. Some of
the happiest people in the world...

405
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,420
go home smelling to high
heaven at the end of the day.

406
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,100
All right. What is this?

407
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,580
How do you know my father, and
how did you get my pager number?

408
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,900
Oh, I know quite a
lot about you, Bruce...

409
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,700
just about everything there is to know.

410
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:01,380
Everything you've ever said or
done or thought about doing...

411
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,140
right there in that file cabinet.

412
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,420
Wow. A whole drawer just for me.

413
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,420
Yeah. Mind if I take a look?

414
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,620
It's your life. This oughta be good.

415
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,580
Now, this last entry
was a little disturbing.

416
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,660
"The gloves are off, God."

417
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,940
"God has taken my bird and my bush."

418
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,780
"God is a
mean kid with a magnifying glass."

419
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,260
"Smite me, O mighty smiter!"

420
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,260
Now, I'm not much for blaspheming,
but that last one made me laugh.

421
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,100
Are you spying on me?

422
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,100
- Who are you?
- I'm the one.

423
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:11,420
- Huh?
- Creator of the heavens and the earth, alpha and omega.

424
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,900
Oh, I see where this is going.

425
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,860
Bruce, I'm God.

426
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,140
Bingo! Yahtzee! Is
that your final answer?

427
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,060
Our survey says, "God!"
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing!

428
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,660
Well, it was nice to meet you,
God. Thank you for the Grand Canyon,

429
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,820
and good luck with the apocalypse.

430
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,340
Oh, and by the way, you suck!

431
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,540
You know what would've been a
little more impressive, though?

432
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,420
If you hadn't used the
cheesy file cabinet illusion.

433
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,260
Anybody with a brain stem
can tell that that drawer...

434
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,540
is being fed through the
wall from the other side.

435
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,260
All you have to do is find
the crease, right around here.

436
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,260
There is a seam here...
or a hollow spot.

437
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,140
Where? Through the drywall and concrete?

438
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,420
Okay. That is a
good one. That is a good one.

439
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,980
- Okay. How many fingers am I holding up?
- Now, Bruce.

440
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,580
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord... Hey,
if you can't do it, man, that's cool.

441
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,100
Three. Two. Four. Nine. Six.

442
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,060
Eight. One.

443
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,700
Okay. How many now?

444
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,980
- Seven.
- Aha!

445
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,580
You've been doing a lot
of complaining about me, Bruce.

446
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,380
And quite frankly, I'm tired
of it. Wait. Don't come near me.

447
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,460
When I'm backed into a
corner, I'm like a wild animal.

448
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,700
I don't wanna hurt you, but I will, out
of instinct. You haven't won a fight...

449
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,500
since grade five, and
that was against a girl.

450
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,740
Yeah, but she was huge.
She had been held back.

451
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,860
And the sun was in your
eyes. Oh, there you go.

452
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,420
In a way, I brought you
here to offer you a job.

453
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,020
Job? What job? My job.

454
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,380
You think you can do it
better, so here's your chance.

455
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,340
When you leave this building, you
will be endowed with all my powers.

456
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,700
Whatever you say, pal.

457
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,580
Okay. That did not happen, and
no one needs to hear about it.

458
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,460
I'm deleting the program.

459
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,860
No. No. I'm having a
breakdown, that's what it is.

460
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,740
Normal, everyday psychotic episode
caused by a tumor or brain lesion.

461
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,260
Come on. Start!

462
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,260
That was lucky.

463
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,740
Come on, man. Calm down. You did not
meet God; you do not have his powers.

464
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,100
If that was God, then
I'm Clint Eastwood.

465
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,060
Holy hell!

466
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,180
Be careful what you wish for, punk.

467
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,220
No. Uh-uh! No. No.

468
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,900
I am a reasonable, sane
human being with a. 44 Magnum,

469
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,020
the most powerful handgun
in the wo...

470
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,540
I'm not Clint Eastwood. I'm Bruce Nolan.

471
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,780
Bruce Nolan. I'm Bruce No-lan!

472
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,220
Oh, it's not real. It's not real.

473
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,500
Coffee? Yeah. Uh, coffee. Yeah.

474
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,780
We have a special on soup today.
No. That's fine. Thank you.

475
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,380
It's tomato. I made it myself.

476
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,500
Okay. Okay.

477
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,780
Excuse me. I need a sp...

478
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,660
It's okay. I found one.

479
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,820
Here's your soup.

480
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,700
Oh, soup. Right. Uh, yeah. Right.

481
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,260
Having fun?

482
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,500
Thy... Thou..."

483
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,740
Come. Take a closer walk with me.

484
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,460
- Let me explain the rules.
- Rules?

485
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,260
Yeah. You left in such a rush,
I didn't get a chance to explain.

486
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,460
Two extra fingers freaked
me out a little bit.

487
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,420
I just figured I'd get your attention.

488
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,340
I did the same thing to Gandhi;
he didn't eat for three weeks.

489
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,860
Anyway, here's the deal.

490
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,820
You have all my powers.
Use them any way you choose.

491
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,140
There are only two rules. You
can't tell anybody you're God.

492
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,420
Believe me, you don't want
that kind of attention.

493
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,140
And you can't mess with free will.

494
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,700
Uh-huh. Can I ask why?

495
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,300
Yes, you can! That's the beauty of it!

496
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,500
This is amazing.
Speaking of amazing... Excuse me.

497
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,060
Oh.

498
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,460
Holy sh... cow.

499
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,660
Since you're through with
these, I think I'll keep 'em.

500
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,580
Might come in handy someday.

501
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,420
See you around, kid.

502
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,180
- Where you going?
- I'm taking a vacation.

503
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,940
God doesn't take vacations,
does he? Do... ye?

504
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,420
Did you ever hear of the Dark
Ages? Besides, I'm covered.

505
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,780
You can clear everything up in
five minutes if you want to, right?

506
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,100
Ciao.

507
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,460
"I've
got the power" Boom!

508
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,740
"I've got the power"

509
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,260
And he saw that it was good.

510
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,180
"I've got the power"

511
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:51,300
Whoa.

512
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,380
""Gettin,
gettin' gettin'kind ofheavy"

513
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,300
"Gettin, gettin' gettin'kind ofheavy"

514
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,220
"I've got the power"

515
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,500
B-E-A-utiful.

516
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,140
- Hey. Check it out. Check it out.
- Hey. Check it out.

517
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,700
Oh, look. It's the
hero. What's up, homie?

518
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,020
Yo, brethren, what up with
thee? Blessings on your alley.

519
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,740
Looking for another can of whoop-ass?

520
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,280
- You didn't get enough, Mr. Hero?
- He wants some more.

521
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:33,780
Surely I say unto you dudes,
I do not wish to fight.

522
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,460
So as soon as you apologize and make a
full reckoning of your transgressions,

523
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,940
I shall absolve you and continue
along the path of righteousness.

524
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,660
What are you talkin' about, man?

525
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,420
Straight up. You talk kind of
funny, you know what I mean?

526
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,380
I don't know if you've lost it all up in
here or what, but check this out, homie.

527
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,460
You want me and the homies
to apologize, right? Mm-hmm.

528
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,580
Cool. Tell you what. We'll apologize
the day a monkey comes out of my butt.

529
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,860
Then you get your
"sorry." How 'bout that?

530
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,780
What a coincidence, because
that's today.

531
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,180
Oh!

532
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,260
Hey, did that monkey just come out your crack, man?

533
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,100
Ohh.

534
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,580
This is some voodoo
shit, man. Let's go!

535
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,940
Are you guys leavin'?

536
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,340
Hey, don't forget your parting gifts!

537
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:08,220
Hey, little anal-dwelling butt monkey.
Time for you to go home, little buddy.

538
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,220
No!

539
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,980
No!

540
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,380
I am Bruce Almighty!

541
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,820
My will be done!

542
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,060
"What if God was one of us"

543
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,100
"Just a slob like one of us"

544
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,180
"Just a stranger on a bus"

545
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,620
"Tryin'to make his way"

546
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,420
"Home"

547
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,100
My God. You can call me Bruce.

548
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,140
What happened to you? You seem so...

549
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,180
happy.

550
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,020
Why shouldn't I be... on
a night like this? Wow.

551
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,580
Those are amazing. What are
these? They're a new breed.

552
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,380
Cross-pollination between
tulips and daisies.

553
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,100
I call them tu-daisies.

554
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,860
Okay.

555
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,740
Honey, these flowers are really
beautiful, but last night...

556
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,780
Last night, I was only human.

557
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,540
Barry, help me out here.

558
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,180
"Oh, baby"

559
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,340
"Oh, baby" "Yeah, I'll be here"

560
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,260
"Forever and ever
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

561
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,060
"I'll see you through"

562
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,940
"Makin'love to you right
now That's all I wanna do"

563
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,620
"'Cause I found"

564
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,180
"What the world is searchin'for"

565
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,940
"For someonejust like you
make me feel the way you do"

566
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,740
"Never, never gonna give you up"

567
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,140
"I'm never, ever gonna stop"

568
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,740
"Not the way I feel about you"

569
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,780
"Girl, I just can't live without you"

570
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,540
Honey. Hi. Wow.

571
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,940
I've never seen the moon that big! Yeah.

572
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,420
"Oh, baby" We really shouldn't waste it.

573
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,540
Ohh.

574
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,300
Ohh.

575
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,820
Bedroom? Five minutes.

576
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,020
"Right about now funk soul
brother" Let there be light.

577
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,780
- "Right about now"
- I'll be out in a minute.

578
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,860
- "Funk soul brother Check it out now"
- Don't rush yourself.

579
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,940
Sometimes anticipation
can heighten the pleas-ure.

580
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,980
Oh, God! Oh!

581
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,940
It's a
funny thing about pleasure.

582
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,420
Wow. It can be quite...
pleasurable!

583
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,300
Oh, my God!

584
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,660
- Pleasurable.
- Oh, God!

585
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,180
Oh, God!

586
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,580
Pleasurable. Pleasurable.

587
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:56,060
In international news, Japanese relief
workers are staging a desperate effort...

588
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,940
to rescue hundreds of people stranded by
a freak tidal wave that hit Kitamoto City.

589
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,020
Scientists say the tsunami may have
been caused by what they're describing...

590
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,180
as unusual lunar activity.

591
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,500
More on this as it develops.

592
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:18,460
Please bless my mommy, my
daddy and especially my little sister.

593
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,180
Please help me, Lord.
Please get me through this.

594
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,940
All I'm asking
is would you help me?

595
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,460
Thank you for everything
else in my life. Amen.

596
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,980
Sam!

597
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:58,980
Good boy.

598
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,340
Ah... Forget something?

599
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,420
Hmm.

600
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,580
Good boy. There are
girls in the house, huh?

601
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,660
Morning. Morning!

602
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,260
I made you grilled
cheese. Ooh, my favey!

603
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,900
- Honey, last night was just...
- Heavenly? I know. I know.

604
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,860
I mean, I woke up this morning, and
I felt like my boobs were bigger.

605
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,860
Ohh. I mean, do they look bigger to you?

606
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,660
Uh, what? Your, um, hmm? No. Uh...

607
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,980
- Bigger?
- Oh, come on! Look at them!

608
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:41,060
Please. They are definitely bigger.
I mean, look. They feel huge.

609
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,780
Well, listen, I, uh, have to go,

610
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:48,020
but this has been the
breast bek... breast...

611
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,740
Thank you. Where are you going?

612
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,980
To get my job back.

613
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,340
"Yeah, yeah"

614
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,820
"I am great Yeah, yeah"

615
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,100
"I am..." Good grief.
Is that what I'm drivin'?

616
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,900
Whoa. Nice car, man.

617
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,180
Yeah. It gets me from "A" to "B."

618
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,180
Oh, darn. All this horsepower
and no room to gallop.

619
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:41,660
Heigh-ho, Silver, away!

620
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,340
I certainly wouldn't want to be
a fugitive on the run with Hank,

621
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,340
Buffalo's number-one
police dog on the job.

622
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,780
This is Phil Sidleman reporting from
the Police Canine Training Center,

623
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,860
Channel 5 News.

624
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,740
And cut it.

625
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,780
"Hey-Hey!
Look what the cat coughed up!

626
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,780
Channel 7, right? You're the guy
that went crazy? I had a bad moment.

627
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,140
What are you doing here?
Just looking for a story.

628
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,980
There's no story here.
This pond is all fished out.

629
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,020
Pretty standard stuff
anyway. I don't know.

630
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,740
My instinct tells me there's something
more. Yeah? Well, go with that.

631
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,820
It served you well in the past, right?

632
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,580
Mm-hmm.

633
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,780
Hey! Hank found something!

634
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,100
Hey, we got a body! Over here!

635
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,900
Get the camera! Now!

636
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:49,140
- It's locked, and the keys are inside!
- I guess every dog has his day.

637
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,980
Hey, kid. You wanna make 10 bucks?
You know how to use one of these?

638
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,860
Duh.

639
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,260
Seems to be in tune. Let's do this.

640
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,260
The body ofJimmy Hoffa was
uncovered in a field today...

641
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,420
outside of a canine training
center in Buffalo, New York.

642
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,940
Bruce Nolan was the first on the
scene. Thank you, Jane.

643
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,020
As you can see behind us, the
body is being carefully exhumed...

644
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,460
and will be transported
to a medical facility,

645
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,540
where D.N.A. Testing
can confirm the identity.

646
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,380
That, however, merely a
formality at this point,

647
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,860
as in a bizarre twist, the body was
found buried with a birth certificate...

648
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,180
and complete set of dental records.

649
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:28,660
I'd call that a red-letter day for any K-9
unit, but was that enough for old Hank here?

650
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,340
No, sirree. Moments later, he
busted a local news camera crew...

651
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,940
With 220 pounds of marijuana.

652
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:41,260
I never saw it before, I
swear!

653
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:46,900
I'm Bruce Nolan, and that's
the way the cookie crumbles.

654
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,180
Yeah! Did you like that?

655
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,740
Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

656
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,900
Hi, Bruce. Oh, hi, Susan.

657
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,780
Good work. I'm impressed.

658
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,620
- Jack, did you need me for something?
- Bruce! Bruce!

659
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,900
Just the man I wanna see. Hey.

660
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,740
Hoffa? What are the odds of
that? What are the odds of that?

661
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,020
Bruce, why don't you sit down? Okay.

662
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,620
I'm gonna be straight with
you. We want you back, Bruce.

663
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,100
But I want you to understand it
was not my decision to let you go.

664
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,780
When the big guy gives the order,
you gotta... No harm, no foul, Jack.

665
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,900
I needed some time to reassess my goals
and get in touch with my true self.

666
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,420
You did that in a day? Imagine
what I could do with seven.

667
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,260
Look, Bruce. It is not in
my power to give you anchor.

668
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,140
Now, as far as field reporting
goes, if you're looking for a bump...

669
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,860
Jack, let's just cut the crap
and get down to brass tacks here.

670
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,260
I'm kidding
with you, and you...

671
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:54,460
I had you going, Jackie. Don't
even worry about it, old friend.

672
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:58,460
You just give me a camera,
Jack; I'll give you the news.

673
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,900
"A little less conversation a
little more action"

674
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,340
"All this aggravation ain't"satisfactioning"me"

675
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:09,460
My secret is that I
let thejalapenos marinate...

676
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:15,100
in a spicy sauce for at least 24
hours before I stir it into the chili.

677
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:20,340
Then I let it all come to a
simmer b... Oh!

678
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:27,620
Hold that thought, Hazel! It seems as if
an asteroid or some kind of meteorite...

679
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:32,100
has just hit ground right outside
the Mark Twain Chili Cook-Off.

680
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,900
This should certainly
spice things up a bit.

681
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,580
- His stories are all over town.
- From unearthing Jimmy Hoffa...

682
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,620
To a meteor crashing to earth...

683
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,900
Bruce Nolan is rapidly
becoming known as...

684
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:49,220
"Yeah a little less conversation
a little more action"

685
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,140
"All this conversation ain't"satisfactioning"me"

686
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,340
"A little more bite and a little more bark"

687
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,340
"A little less fight and a little
more spark""

688
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,540
And that's the way the cookie crumbles!

689
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,140
Was this
Bruce's idea? Uh-huh.

690
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:12,340
He said he wanted me to have a day
of beauty and luxurious serenity.

691
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,660
I gotta tell you. He is really impressing me lately.

692
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,660
You know where he's taking
me to dinner tonight?

693
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,820
Hmm. Where?

694
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,580
- The Blue
Palm? - Mm-hmm.

695
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,620
- Oh, my gosh. I just got chills.
- I know.

696
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,420
And he told me to prepare for the most
memorable night of our entire lives.

697
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,100
Oh, my gosh. Grace, he's gonna propose.

698
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,860
Stop it. No. Really?

699
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,100
Yeah. Really. Come on. You do the math.

700
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,980
He sends you all day to a beauty spa. He's
taking you to the most romantic restaurant,

701
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,180
where you had your first date.

702
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,620
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but Bruce is right. This is your big night.

703
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,060
Relax and enjoy it. Oh, God.

704
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,540
Ow. Ow.

705
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,660
Welcome to Eyewitness
News at 6:00 with Susan Ortega,

706
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,900
Evan Baxter, Fred Donohue...
sports, Dallas Coleman... weather.

707
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,340
And now, Buffalo's
number-one news team.

708
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,460
Good evening, and welcome to Eyewitness
News at 6:00. I'm Susan Ortega.

709
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,860
And I'm Evan Baxter, and
here's what's making news.

710
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:20,220
A potential scandal with the
Buffalo P.D. Surfaced today...

711
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,660
when the mayor...

712
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,140
- I'm sorry. I'm seem to have something stuck in my...
- Somebody get him some water.

713
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,780
Looks like my new
coanchor may need a glass of water.

714
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,860
Oh. There we go. Sorry
about that.

715
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,900
In other news, the prime minister
of Sweden visited Washington today,

716
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,860
and my tiny little
nipples went to France.

717
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,940
What did he just say?
Check the prompter.

718
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,900
- The prompter's fine.
- Evan, read the copy, please. The copy's good. Just read it.

719
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,940
The White House reception committee
greeted the prime rib roast minister,

720
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,460
and I do the cha-cha like a sissy girl.

721
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:16,180
- I
"lika"do the cha-cha.

722
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,580
I'm sorry. We seem to be having
some technical difficulties.

723
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,500
In other news...

724
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,860
My apologies.

725
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,060
Doo-doo,
caca, poo-poo.

726
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,700
Pee-pee!

727
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:25,700
"If I ruled the world"

728
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,540
"Every day would be
the first day of spring"

729
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:36,340
"Every heart would
have a new song to sing"

730
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,860
"And we'd sing"

731
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,700
"Of thejoy every morning would bring"

732
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,580
"If I ruled the world"

733
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,980
"Every man would be as free as a bird"

734
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,940
May I? Thank you. Certainly.

735
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,820
"Every voice would be
a voice to be heard"

736
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:02,220
It's
perfect. She'll love it.

737
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,100
"We would treasure each day that occurs"

738
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,940
You know, uh,"

739
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:12,700
I was gonna, uh... I was gonna
wait until after the meal,

740
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,340
but it's gonna burst out of me
like an alien if I don't do it now.

741
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,980
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Okay.

742
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,580
This is it, isn't it?

743
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,460
I don't know. I don't
know if I'm ready for this.

744
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,820
I mean, I'm ready for this.
I just don't know if I would...

745
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,260
I didn't think I would
have... I'm sorry. Go on.

746
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,220
I didn't know this was
so important to you.

747
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,900
Me neither. Me neither.

748
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,620
Oh."

749
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,100
Grace. Yes.

750
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,380
Grace. Yes.

751
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,660
I got anchor.

752
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,820
Yes.

753
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,780
Apparently, it wasn't
working out with Evan,

754
00:54:55,860 --> 00:55:00,460
so he's gonna finish out the
week, and I go live on Monday.

755
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,940
That's great, honey. That's
great. I know. I know.

756
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,860
Wow.

757
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,060
So that's what this is all about?

758
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:14,100
Well, yeah. Yeah.

759
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,820
Grace, we got anchor. Jack's
throwing me a party Friday night...

760
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,100
at the Vanderbilt estate to celebrate.

761
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,300
What's the matter? Nothing.

762
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,180
Now I lay me down to sleep.

763
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,700
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
Oh, I feel so stupid. I feel stupid.

764
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,820
Wow, it is kinda loud in here, isn't it?

765
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:32,260
- No, it's not loud.
- Geez, can you keep it down to a dull roar?

766
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,180
What are you... Thank you.

767
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,900
Is that supposed to be funny? 'Cause
that is not funny. If I should die before I wake,

768
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,860
I pray the Lord my soul to
take. What are you saying?

769
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,700
What is wrong with you? Stop
yelling!

770
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,580
Uh, would you excuse me?

771
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:48,940
I think I'll take a little trip to
the, um...

772
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,780
The wine is
going right through me.

773
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,580
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

774
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,060
Keep going, Tony! You're great! Oh, God.

775
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:03,180
What is going on here? Oh, what is this?

776
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,220
Give me a break!

777
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,620
Really something, isn't it?

778
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,500
Is this heaven?

779
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,020
No, this is Mount Everest.

780
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,180
You should flip on the Discovery
Channel from time to time.

781
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,020
But I guess you can't
now, being dead and all.

782
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,140
I'm dead?

783
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,100
Nah, I'm just messin' with you.

784
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,020
That's not funny, man. That
is not funny!

785
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,660
Okay.

786
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,900
And what about the voices in my head?

787
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,940
Is that part of the hilarity?
No, those are prayers.

788
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,900
And you keep ignoring them, they're
gonna build up on you like that.

789
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,660
But it's just noise. I
can't understand them.

790
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,740
Well, you're not listening, son.

791
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,220
Let's see.

792
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,740
You've had my powers for
a little over a week now.

793
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,260
How many people have you helped?

794
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:04,420
L-I took care of a few things. I righted
a few wrongs in my own life first, okay?

795
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,380
I was gonna help the others.

796
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,820
I think I could help the
world. Mm-hmm. The world?

797
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,740
That wasn't the world.

798
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,900
That was just Buffalo between
57 th Street and Commonwealth.

799
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,740
Oh.

800
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,420
I didn't want to start you off
with more than you could handle.

801
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,380
Well, you took the job, Bruce,
so I suggest you get to it.

802
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:28,580
Seeing him
smile would make me so happy.

803
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,180
Prayers, prayers. Okay, prayers. Oh!

804
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,220
This
creepy whisper thing has to end.

805
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,260
Organization and
management is what I need.

806
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,860
I need a system. Something concrete.

807
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,420
Concentrate!

808
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,380
Files.

809
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,380
Let all prayers be organized into files.

810
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,100
Well, that takes care of the voices.

811
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,180
Not exactly a space saver though.

812
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,460
Grace might notice.

813
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,140
I know. Prayer Post-Its!

814
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,340
Shh!

815
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:18,060
Okay, I need something with a lock,
security, combination, a password.

816
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,620
A password.

817
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,100
"Yahweh"

818
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,660
You've got prayers.

819
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,780
Welcome to the revelation superhighway.

820
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,980
We bless. No mess. Downloading now.

821
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,820
It's good. It's good.

822
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,460
This is gonna take a while.

823
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:53,260
1,527,503 prayer requests?

824
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:58,220
I'd better manifest some coffee.

825
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:03,180
Hola, Juan Valdez.

826
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,020
Buenos dias. Buenos dias.

827
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:08,820
Disfrute un buen cafe. Gracias, senor.

828
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,740
Adios.

829
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,660
Adios.

830
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:20,940
Ah! Now, that's fresh mountain-grown
coffee from the hills of Colombia.

831
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,020
It's good.

832
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,340
It's good!

833
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:52,460
Okay, I had to have made some
kind of a dent by now.

834
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,700
Oh, come on!

835
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,180
What a bunch of whiners. This
is gonna suck up my whole life.

836
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,340
You know what?

837
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,740
Yes to all!

838
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:12,180
Yeah, there ya go.

839
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,100
Now everybody's happy.

840
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:25,980
I'll drink to that. My tech
stocks tripled in five days.

841
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,260
You know something, Joe?
You seem taller. I am.

842
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,100
My daughter pitched a no-hitter.

843
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:33,860
I lost 47 pounds on
the Krispy Kreme diet.

844
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,060
Hey, there he is, the man of the hour!

845
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:40,740
Bless you. Bless all of you.

846
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:45,460
Be fruitful and do long
division or something.

847
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,740
Hey, try that. It's an excellent year.

848
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,580
Hey, Bruce. Who do you like
in the game tonight? Hey.

849
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,980
I like the Sabres.
Coach prays a lot. Okay.

850
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,900
"And I hear it in the windy storm"

851
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,860
"And I feel it in the icy dawn"

852
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,340
"God gave me everything
I want, now, come on"

853
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:11,540
"I'll give it all to you, babe"

854
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:14,540
"God gave me everything
I want"

855
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,660
Hey, this is
Bruce, Grace and Sam. Leave a message.

856
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,580
Grace, are you there?

857
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,620
Hello. It's me.

858
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,300
Hello? Hello, hello,
hello, hello, hello.

859
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,460
Come on, Grace. Come to the party.

860
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,700
I'll call you later, okay?

861
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,660
Come on, Sam."

862
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,660
Help me out here.

863
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,540
Nature's not doing it.

864
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,780
- What'd you wish when you...
- Oh, Sam, don't! Come on!

865
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,220
Come on. Tell me. If I told
you, it might not come true.

866
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,700
What is it you want,
Mary? What do you want?

867
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,260
You... You want the moon?

868
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,820
Just say the word, and I'll throw
a lasso around it and pull it down.

869
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,380
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.

870
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,660
I'll give you the moon,
Mary. I'll take it.

871
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:59,140
Then what?

872
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:03,020
Well, then you could swallow
it, and it'll all dissolve, see?

873
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,980
The moonbeams would shoot out of
your fingers and your toes...

874
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,580
And the ends of your hair.

875
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,580
Hey, this is
Bruce, Grace and Sam...

876
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:25,300
Hi, Bruce.

877
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,260
What are you doing in here all alone?

878
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:33,140
Oh, I was just gonna...
Oh, uh, I mean...

879
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,060
I was gonna, uh, give Grace a call.

880
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:42,700
Yeah, I didn't see her in there.
So, how are you and Grace doing?

881
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:45,740
Well, actually, we
had a-a bit of a fight.

882
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,660
Kind of... I'm not
sure if she's...

883
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:51,180
You're on fire, Bruce. Hmm?

884
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:54,220
Some women can't handle the fire.

885
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,980
Some can.

886
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,460
That's interesting, 'cause,
you know, I never thought...

887
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,820
we would ever talk.

888
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:07,300
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

889
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,220
Mmm.

890
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,220
Grace!

891
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,180
Aah!

892
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:22,060
"Everything so confusing" You
might wanna stop touching me.

893
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:25,540
Now isn't a good time. Grace!
"Maybe I'm just out of my mind"

894
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:29,380
Grace! Grace, come here!

895
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,300
Grace, this is so weird.
I was just calling you.

896
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:35,420
Oh, yeah. What? And you thought,
like, Susan's mouth was the phone?

897
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:38,100
L... She kissed me. I didn't...
I'm the "kissee." Grace...

898
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,420
Oh, please. Yeah, you were
putting up a really big fight.

899
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,260
I tried to fight her off. I tried
to stop her, but she's really strong.

900
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,540
Okay, I screwed up.
Can I make it up to you?

901
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:48,620
Yeah! Why don't you,
uh, get me a boat, Bruce.

902
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,540
What? Yeah, a big boat.

903
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:53,860
And then maybe two big bags of
cash. Then... Then I'll be happy.

904
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,980
Lots of money and lots of stuff.

905
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,380
Other people want idiotic
crap like getting married...

906
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,900
or having babies with the man
that they've loved for five years.

907
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:04,060
But not me, Bruce. Just gimme the boat.

908
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,020
No wonder you stayed single!

909
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,940
Oh! Grace, don't do
this! I'm not doing this.

910
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:11,140
I'm undoing it. I'll be at Debbie's.

911
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,220
You take care of Sam until
I can make arrangements.

912
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:19,460
You can't leave me.

913
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,340
I'm the alpha, lady!

914
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:24,540
I'm the omega, baby!

915
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:26,900
Okay, fine. I don't need you.

916
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:37,580
What's the matter, Bruce? She
can't handle a little competition?

917
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,940
The game's been called
on account of rain.

918
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,260
An unusually high number
oflottery winners...

919
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,180
has New York officials concerned.

920
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:02,860
So far, 1, 100 winning
tickets have been turned in,

921
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,660
all strangely from the Buffalo area.

922
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,900
More on this story as it develops.

923
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,460
Enjoying your party?

924
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:14,340
Nothing like spending quality
time with great friends, huh?

925
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:18,980
Grace left me.

926
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,900
Yeah, I know.

927
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,260
She'll take me back.

928
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,860
She'll take me back, right?

929
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,500
Would you take you back?

930
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,540
Oh.

931
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:37,220
How do you make somebody love
you without affecting free will?

932
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,780
Welcome to my world, son.

933
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,780
You come up with an answer
to that one, you let me know.

934
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,620
Rise and shine, Buffalo.

935
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,220
It's 70 and sunny, and the
perfect day to forgive Bruce.

936
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,580
"I don't know much"

937
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:06,980
"But I know I love you"

938
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,140
Bye. Have fun. You got it.

939
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:17,460
"Every point of view has another angle"

940
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,420
"And every angle has its merit"

941
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,100
"And do you ever feel"

942
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:27,980
"That there is something missing"

943
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:34,260
"There's a God-shaped
hole in all of us"

944
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,220
"And the restless soul is searching" Hi.

945
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,940
- Can I get a small coffee to go?
- Sure, hon. Just a sec.

946
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:43,380
K-Tel Records brings you
the 100 greatest love songs of all time.

947
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:47,100
You'll hear such classics
as "All You Need Is Bruce."

948
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,860
"If You Can't Be With The One
You Love, Then Love Bruce."

949
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,180
"Do That To Bruce One More Time."

950
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:57,940
And who can forget that classic,
"Bruce So Horny, He Love You Long Time."

951
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,820
Order today and we'll throw
in at no extra charge...

952
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,980
the video Sweatin' To Bruce.

953
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:08,700
Just dial 1-900-4GIVHIM.
That's 1-900-4GIVHIM. Do it now.

954
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:12,300
"Do you ever feel"

955
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:15,660
"That there is something missing"

956
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:22,100
"There's a God-shaped
hole in all of us"

957
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:26,460
"And the restless soul is searching"

958
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:30,940
"There's a God-shaped
hole in all of us"

959
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:35,820
"And it's a void only he can fill"

960
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:38,860
Oh, no, no, no. Honey, no. Oh, gosh,
please don't put that in your mouth.

961
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,940
We don't eat that. Oh, that's not food.

962
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,380
Go to the bathroom,
please. Wash out your mouth.

963
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,420
Wash off your hands.

964
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,860
God, I swear that kid is
gonna poop an ornament.

965
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,180
One more time, you're
gonna be in a lot of trouble.

966
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:52,980
All right. That's it!

967
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:56,100
That's it! Hi.

968
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:00,940
I surrender! I surrender! I surrender.

969
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,060
Hi. Hi.

970
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,380
I'm, uh, doing my first anchor tonight.

971
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,260
Oh, wow! That's great!

972
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:18,340
So how have you been doing? Good.

973
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:22,700
Yeah? Yeah. Good. Just,
um... Debbie won the lottery.

974
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,580
Oh, yeah? You're kidding.

975
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:29,580
But I guess so did 400,000 other
people, so she only won, like, $17.

976
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,540
I miss you.

977
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,780
Okay.

978
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:42,420
I took the first step.
Jumped out on the ledge.

979
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:47,860
Feeling pretty vulnerable too. I
don't know what you want me to say.

980
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,540
Just say you love me and
you want me back. No, Bruce.

981
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,780
Come on. What about all the signs?

982
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:56,740
How did you know about
that? Did you talk to Debbie?

983
01:08:56,820 --> 01:09:00,140
Look, would it help if I just
said that I was a complete ass?

984
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:03,660
- Hey, you said "ass."
- Yeah, but it's okay if I'm talking about a donkey.

985
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,740
- I didn't say "hole." If I said "ass"...
- Wait! Wait!

986
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:08,860
Okay, you know what, honey?
Let's go. Let's go inside.

987
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:11,940
All right, kids. Everybody
inside. Time to go inside.

988
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,660
Grace, please,

989
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:16,780
none of this seems right without you.

990
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:22,860
Yeah, I gotta go.

991
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,820
Wait!

992
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,340
Uh...

993
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,260
How do you feel now?

994
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:38,380
Have you completely lost your mind?

995
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:41,740
What? Are you drunk? Yeah,
I'm drunk. Drunk with power.

996
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:49,780
Love me. Love me.

997
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:54,500
Love me. Love me!

998
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,420
I did.

999
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:12,300
Yeah, I know... free will. Oh, God.

1000
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:14,220
More power outages reported today...

1001
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,780
caused by last week's meteorite strike.

1002
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:20,180
Officials are desperately trying
to repair several transformers...

1003
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,860
damaged by the ensuing electrical surge.

1004
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:26,580
The scene nearly turned violent when
hundreds of disgruntled Buffalo residents...

1005
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:29,580
protested last week's lottery results.

1006
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:32,780
And doomsayers are pointing to last
week's strange celestial events...

1007
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,900
as signs that prophesy
is now being fulfilled...

1008
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:38,540
and the world as we know
it may be coming to an end.

1009
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:41,100
World's gone mad.

1010
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:43,140
Bruce, 30 seconds to air. Okay. Okay.

1011
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:46,140
There you are. It's your big
debut. How are you feeling?

1012
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:49,460
You know what? Fine. Never better.

1013
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:52,900
Show must go on, right?

1014
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:58,220
The Sabres just won the
Stanley Cup. You're kidding me!

1015
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,420
Was that tonight?
That's great, isn't it?

1016
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,340
It's getting pretty
crazy out there. Uh-huh.

1017
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,820
- We're gonna kick live to Fred at the stadium, okay?
- Five seconds to the open.

1018
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:10,220
- This is it. You ready?
- Born that way.

1019
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,780
Welcome to Eyewitness
News at 6:00, with Susan Ortega,

1020
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:17,900
Bruce Nolan, Fred Donohue...
sports... Dallas Coleman... weather.

1021
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,820
And now, Buffalo's
number-one news team.

1022
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,380
I'm Susan Ortega. I'm Bruce Nolan.

1023
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:25,500
And here's what's making news.

1024
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,940
What happened? What the
hell happened? We lost power.

1025
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,260
Transformer's down again. Oh, geez.

1026
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:32,740
Ever since that damn meteorite hit.

1027
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:35,140
It's okay. We're back up.

1028
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:38,540
We apologize for the interruption.
And now back to the news. Bruce.

1029
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:42,380
Thank you, Susan. I'm sorry.
We're going live to H.S.B.C. Arena,

1030
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:45,420
where the Buffalo Sabres
have won the Stanley Cup.

1031
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,860
Great. Fred.

1032
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,300
We're about to uncork
some champagne because...

1033
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:53,740
the Sabres have won their
first championship in 22 years!

1034
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,900
What in the blue blazes...

1035
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:02,300
We'll be back with the Sabres' Stanley
Cup victory in just a hot second.

1036
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:05,180
In other news... Bloody hell!

1037
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:07,500
For the love of God, what is
it now? The whole booth is down.

1038
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,420
No, it's not!

1039
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:12,940
In other news, fighting erupted in...

1040
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,260
the Gaza Strip today, as
Israelis and Palestinians...

1041
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,420
Bruce. We've got a situation here. What?

1042
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,620
- They're rioting right outside the station.
- You're kidding.

1043
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,380
The whole town has gone crazy.

1044
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,020
Come on, Bruce. Say something.

1045
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:35,660
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, this just in.

1046
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:37,940
Possibly...

1047
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:42,140
the biggest breaking news
story this town has ever seen.

1048
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,020
And I gotta go.

1049
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,980
I'm sorry, Jack.

1050
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,140
Susan, it's all yours.

1051
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:01,100
Sabres!

1052
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,180
Sabres rule!

1053
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:09,420
Repent! The
end is near! Repent!

1054
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,220
Come back with my bubble gum machine!

1055
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:23,500
The lottery sucks!

1056
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:27,380
I only won 17 bucks!

1057
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,020
Channel 7 fries!

1058
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,740
Oh! Oh, no!

1059
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:52,220
God?

1060
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,140
Are you here?

1061
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:59,460
Hello? I need your help.

1062
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,660
Clap on. Clap on.

1063
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:07,300
Clap on! Clap on! Clap on!

1064
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:12,140
Figures!

1065
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,740
Well, hello there, Bruce Almighty.

1066
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,940
Not as easy as it looks, is it, son?

1067
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:26,220
- This God business.
- They're all out of control.

1068
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:30,300
It's mayhem. I don't know what to do.

1069
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:33,140
Well, you're right on time... 7:00.

1070
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,700
The seventh at 7:00.

1071
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,740
All righty then.

1072
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,500
There we are. It's good. It's good!

1073
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:03,300
It's a wonderful thing.

1074
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,860
No matter how filthy something gets,

1075
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:09,100
you can always clean it right up.

1076
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:12,060
There were so many, I just
gave them all what they wanted.

1077
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,980
Yeah, but since when...

1078
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:18,580
does anyone have a clue
about what they want?

1079
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:22,340
So what do I do?

1080
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:29,100
Parting your soup is not a
miracle, Bruce. It's a magic trick.

1081
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:32,940
A single mom who's working two jobs...

1082
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:37,020
and still finds time to take her kid
to soccer practice, that's a miracle.

1083
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:41,100
A teenager who says no to
drugs and yes to an education,

1084
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:43,020
that's a miracle.

1085
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,180
People want me to do
everything for them.

1086
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,300
But what they don't realize
is they have the power.

1087
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,220
You wanna see a miracle, son?

1088
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:56,500
Be the miracle.

1089
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,260
Wait. Are you leaving?

1090
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:04,020
Yeah. I see that you
can handle things now.

1091
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,900
But what if I need you.
What if I have questions?

1092
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:11,300
That's your problem,
Bruce. That's everybody's problem.

1093
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,620
You keep looking up.

1094
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:18,900
Order has
been restored in Buffalo...

1095
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:21,100
after this evening's downtown riot.

1096
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:23,820
State officials have
suspended all lottery sales...

1097
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,820
pending further investigation.

1098
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:29,620
No injuries were reported in the
melee; however, there were dozens...

1099
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:12,100
"I've gotta be honest I think you know"

1100
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:16,140
"We're covered in lies and that's okay"

1101
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:19,180
Okay."There's somewhere
beyond this I know"

1102
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,780
Well, thanks a million. God
bless. Oh, not a problem.

1103
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:25,300
"Hope I can find the words to say"

1104
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:28,740
- "Never again, no"
- Bruce giveth...

1105
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,340
and Bruce taketh away.

1106
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:35,380
If you don't like it, megabyte me.

1107
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:39,300
"'Cause you're a god and I am not"

1108
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:42,820
"And I just thought that you would know"

1109
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:45,780
Evan. Bruce.

1110
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:50,220
I suppose you're here to gloat
about the anchor position.

1111
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:52,780
Go ahead. Take your best shot.

1112
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:55,660
Actually, I, uh...

1113
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:58,860
I just came to tell you
that I've been a royal prick.

1114
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:02,820
The anchor position is
yours. I turned down the job.

1115
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:06,100
Oh, and I never really
congratulated you in the first place.

1116
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,020
Congratulations.

1117
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,660
"'Cause you're a god and
I am not" Thanks, Bruce.

1118
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:15,580
In the financial world, things
are settling back to normal...

1119
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:18,100
in what analysts are calling
a fluke market fluctuation.

1120
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:21,460
You made the right move,
Jack. So what about you?

1121
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,460
Are you ready to go back out there?

1122
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,100
And do the cutesy stuff?
The lighter side of the news?

1123
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:30,940
Lower and debase myself for the
amusement of total strangers?

1124
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:33,460
Yeah, I could do that. Sounds like fun.

1125
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,060
Good.

1126
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:39,020
Okay, Sammy, let's do it
right, like all the other dogs.

1127
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:42,700
I don't wanna make you feel bad, but they're
laughing at you. They're laughing at you.

1128
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:46,500
Come on. Concentrate. There you go.
Come on. Pump it out if you have to.

1129
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:50,140
What am I gonna
do with you?

1130
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:54,420
I know this seems kinda crazy,

1131
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,660
but desperate times...

1132
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,580
calls for desperate measures.

1133
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:02,300
Yeah. Okay. Okay, Sammy.

1134
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:04,180
Do your thing.

1135
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,180
That's it. That's it. Good boy!

1136
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:10,260
Training my dog.

1137
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:17,300
"'Cause you're a god and I am not"

1138
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:22,060
"And I just thought that you would know"

1139
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:25,460
"You're a god and I am not"

1140
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:30,060
"And I just thought I'd let you go"

1141
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,100
Yes, we did it! We did it!

1142
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:37,940
"Bow-wow-wow Yippee-yo, yippee-yay
We're doin'it doggy style"

1143
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,900
I'll alert Penthouse Forum.

1144
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:46,220
Hi, Deb. How are you? How's Grace?

1145
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,340
I really didn't come to chat, okay,
Bruce? I came for Grace's stuff.

1146
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:56,460
You need, uh...

1147
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,500
No, it's okay. I've got it.

1148
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:06,980
I don't, uh... I don't know if she...

1149
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:09,220
I don't know if she wants that or not.

1150
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:16,260
This is full. You did all this?

1151
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:30,020
You know what I do every night
before I go to bed? I tuck my kids in,

1152
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,780
maybe have a scoop of
ice cream and watch Conan.

1153
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:37,060
You know what Grace does?

1154
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,180
She prays.

1155
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:42,540
Most of the time for you.

1156
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,900
Find Grace Connelly.

1157
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:11,900
The woman does pray a lot.

1158
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,620
Find Grace, then Bruce.

1159
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,620
"Dear God,
please help Bruce find himself,

1160
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,620
find contentment, find you."

1161
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:24,980
"Dear God, please help Bruce.
He seems to be struggling."

1162
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,020
"Dear God, give Bruce strength."

1163
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,980
"Dear God, bless Bruce."

1164
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:31,860
Bruce. Bruce. Bruce.

1165
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,540
It's her.

1166
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:39,220
Sammy, it's her. She's logging
on. She's praying right now.

1167
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,700
Grace.

1168
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,940
Please, God.

1169
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:52,860
Please. I still love him.

1170
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:57,900
But I don't wanna love him anymore.

1171
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:00,580
I don't wanna hurt anymore. Please.

1172
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:02,500
Help me forget.

1173
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:06,060
Please help me let him go.

1174
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:10,700
Please help me let him go.

1175
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:32,060
You win!

1176
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:33,980
I'm done!

1177
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:38,460
Please, I don't wanna do this anymore.

1178
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:40,940
I don't wanna be God.

1179
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:44,380
I want you to decide
what's right for me.

1180
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,940
I surrender to your will!

1181
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:55,620
Ah! Huh?

1182
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,420
Am I...

1183
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:21,700
You can't kneel down in the middle of a
highway and live to talk about it, son.

1184
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:25,940
But why? Why now?

1185
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:28,780
Bruce,

1186
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:31,700
you have a divine spark.

1187
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:36,620
You have the gift for bringing
joy and laughter to the world.

1188
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:38,820
I know. I created you.

1189
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,420
Quit braggin'. See. That's...

1190
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,580
That's what I'm talking about.

1191
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:46,540
That's the spark.

1192
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,740
What do you want me to do?

1193
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:56,300
I want you to pray, son.

1194
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:59,940
Go ahead. Use them.

1195
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:04,180
Um...

1196
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,980
Lord, feed the hungry.

1197
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:11,620
And bring peace to...

1198
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:15,300
all of mankind.

1199
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:19,140
How's that? Great.

1200
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,060
If you wanna be Miss America.

1201
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:23,340
Now, come on.

1202
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:25,820
What do you really care about?

1203
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,260
Grace.

1204
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:36,300
Grace. You want her back?

1205
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:44,140
No.

1206
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:47,020
I want her to be happy.

1207
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,380
No matter what that means.

1208
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,300
I want her to find someone...

1209
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:57,660
who will treat her...
with all the love...

1210
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:01,140
she deserved from me.

1211
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:05,500
I want her to meet someone...

1212
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:13,500
who will see her always...

1213
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:15,700
as I do now...

1214
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,180
through your eyes.

1215
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:24,300
Now, that's a prayer.

1216
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,300
Yeah?

1217
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:28,580
Yeah.

1218
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:31,260
It's good. It's good.

1219
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:33,700
It's good!

1220
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,580
I'm gonna get right on it.

1221
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:39,500
Clear! Whoa!

1222
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:41,420
That didn't feel very good. Clear!

1223
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:44,380
Got a rhythm.

1224
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,500
All right. I got a pulse.
All right. Let's set him up.

1225
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:48,420
Yeah. Get the backboard and brace.

1226
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:56,620
Bruce? Bruce?

1227
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,860
Welcome back.

1228
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,940
You're lucky to be alive, son.

1229
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:05,380
Someone up there must like you.

1230
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:22,500
I hear all that stuff
winds up in a warehouse somewhere.

1231
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,700
Grace.

1232
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,380
Hi, baby.

1233
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:36,900
Oh. Oh, my God, look at you.

1234
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:40,300
I was such an idiot. It's okay.

1235
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:42,340
It's okay.

1236
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:44,260
It's okay.

1237
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:50,060
I don't know what I would have done.

1238
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:52,180
Oh, God.

1239
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:55,300
I swear I wanted to
be mad at you forever.

1240
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:08,820
Now you're just showing off.

1241
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:23,500
This is Bruce Nolan here at Buffalo's
First-Annual "Be the Miracle" Blood Drive.

1242
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:27,140
It's a B-E-A-utiful day,
so come on down here.

1243
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,060
Because the life you save could be mine.

1244
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:30,980
- Ha, ha.
- Let's go over here,

1245
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:34,700
where the Kowolskis have baked a very
special cookie just for this occasion.

1246
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:37,700
Sure, it's a little creepy and a
shameless plug, but we love 'em.

1247
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:41,100
Thank you, Mama. Vol,
finger... lose.

1248
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,580
I, myself, will have given
blood twice this week.

1249
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,700
For those of you who haven't heard,

1250
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:51,100
I'd like to introduce you to the
future Mrs. Exclusive... Grace Connelly.

1251
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:53,540
There she is.

1252
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:57,860
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?

1253
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:01,620
Shejust gave blood, and she still
has enough left to fill up her face.

1254
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:05,500
Yes, behind every great man, there's
a woman rolling her eyes, folks.

1255
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,420
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness News,

1256
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:10,260
with all the folks down here at
the blood drive, reminding you to...

1257
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:12,260
Be the miracle!

1258
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:15,540
You heard 'em.

1259
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:17,660
Okay, cut it. Thank you, Bruce.

1260
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:20,860
Thanks, Ally. Hey.

1261
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:23,500
How was that? That was great.

1262
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:26,380
Yeah? That was really great. Now,
you still have to go over there.

1263
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:28,420
The nurse is waiting. Oh, do I have to?

1264
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:32,140
Oh, it's not gonna hurt. In fact, I
think you'll find it quite pleasurable.

1265
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,660
Ooh, baby.

1266
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:59,060
"Are you ready for a miracle"

1267
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:01,420
"Ready as I can be"

1268
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:04,580
"Are you ready for a miracle"
"It's ready to set you free"

1269
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:07,220
"Oh, are you ready Are
you ready" "Ready, ready"

1270
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,220
"Are you ready Are you
ready" "Ready, Ready"

1271
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:13,140
"Are you ready for a miracle"

1272
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:17,780
"Oh"

1273
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:20,100
"Are you ready"

1274
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:22,540
"Ready for a miracle"
"Ready, ready Yes, I am"

1275
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:24,660
"Are you ready Are
you ready" "Yes, I am"

1276
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,940
"Are you ready for a miracle" "Yes"

1277
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:31,540
Who can take a rainbow,

1278
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:34,020
wrap it in a sigh?

1279
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:39,220
"Soak it in the sun and
make a groovy lemon pie"

1280
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:43,220
Oompah. Loompah.

1281
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:45,740
Doompah. Oh, geez.

1282
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:49,620
I'm sorry.

1283
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:52,620
I'm a very rare blood
type. I'm A.B. - Positive.

1284
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,980
Hmm. Sounds delicious. Mm-hmm.

1285
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,660
Yeah, well, there, you know, there
are storehouses all over the world.

1286
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:04,620
You know, all over the...
with... with tons of stuff on ice.

1287
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,260
And it's... Sorry. You're like this.

1288
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:10,220
Sorry. Go on. Okay.

01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:18,460
She has a "rarey." Okay.

1292
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,820
Well, they need my blood. I
have a very rare blood type.

1293
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:23,500
I'm A.B. - Negative.
I'm I.B. - Positive.

1294
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:26,700
Am I A.B. - Negative or am I...
I don't know what you are anymore.

1295
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:29,820
I'm gonna need a frickin'
miracle to get to work on time.

1296
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,740
Vroom!

1297
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:43,820
Shit.

1298
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,980
Shit!

1299
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,940
That won't work.

That's right.

1309
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:35,980
Whoo!
