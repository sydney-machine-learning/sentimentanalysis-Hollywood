1
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:57,125
- Wow.
- Mmm.

2
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,111
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:02,027
- Wow.
- Yes, Marlin.

4
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,348
No, I see it.
It's beautiful.

5
00:01:04,383 --> 00:01:07,182
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view...

6
00:01:07,187 --> 00:01:11,183
you didn't think you'd get
the whole ocean, did you?

7
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.

8
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:17,481
Did your man deliver,
or did he deliver?

9
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:20,289
- My man delivered.
- And it wasn't so easy.

10
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:23,655
Because a lot of other clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

11
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:26,116
You better believe they did-
every single one of them.

12
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:28,171
Mm-hmm. You did good.

13
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:30,877
And the neighborhood
is awesome.

14
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:42,523
So, you do like it, don't you?

15
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:46,024
No, no. I do, I do.
I really do like it.

16
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:49,020
But, Marlin, I know that
the drop off is desirable...

17
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,320
with the great schools
and the amazing view...

18
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,366
but do we really need
so much space?

19
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:56,281
Coral, honey, these are our kids
we're talking about.

20
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,417
They deserve the best.
Look, look, look.

21
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,708
They'll wake up,
poke their little heads out...

22
00:02:00,743 --> 00:02:03,833
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

23
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:06,163
Shh. You'll wake the kids.

24
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,003
Oh, right, right.

25
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:15,219
Aw, look. They're dreaming.

26
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:18,691
We still have to name them.

27
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,480
You want to name
all of them right now?

28
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,816
All right, we'll name
this half Marlin Junior...

29
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,228
and this half Coral Junior.

30
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:28,607
- OK, we're done.
- I like Nemo.

31
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:31,373
Nemo. We'll name one Nemo...

32
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:33,988
but I'd like most of them
to be Marlin Junior.

33
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:36,491
Just think,
in a couple of days...

34
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:38,959
- we're going to be parents.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:40,630
What if they don't like me?

36
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:42,135
- Marlin.
- No, really.

37
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,170
There's over 400 eggs.
Odds are, one will like you.

38
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:51,477
What?

39
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:55,182
- You remember how we met?
- I try not to.

40
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,647
Well, I remember.
Excuse me, miss...

41
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:59,147
can you check and see
if I have a hook in my lip?

42
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:01,983
You got a little closer
because it was wiggling.

43
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:04,784
- Get away, get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here.

44
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:08,745
Where did everybody go?

45
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,627
Coral, get inside the house.

46
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:21,653
No, Coral, don't.
They'll be fine.

47
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:24,177
Just get inside-
You, right now.

48
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:28,849
No! Ow!

49
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:30,734
Oh!

50
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:32,478
Ooh! Ooh!

51
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:48,622
Coral!

52
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:56,094
Coral?

53
00:03:58,214 --> 00:03:59,593
Coral?

54
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:07,765
Coral?

55
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:11,526
Coral?

56
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:19,238
Coral?

57
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,969
Oh!

58
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:39,931
Ohh.

59
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:44,122
There, there, there.

60
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:46,312
It's OK. Daddy's here.

61
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:49,232
Daddy's got you.

62
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:56,624
I promise, I will never
let anything happen to you...

63
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,415
Nemo.

64
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:37,257
First day of school!

65
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:40,096
Wake up, wake up!
First day of school.

66
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,672
I don't want to go to school-
five more minutes.

67
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:43,927
Not you, Dad, me.

68
00:05:43,963 --> 00:05:45,347
- OK. Huh?
- Get up, get up.

69
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:48,143
It's time for school,
time for school.

70
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:49,724
All right, I'm up.

71
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,400
Whoa!

72
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,414
- Nemo!
- First day of school!

73
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,360
- Nemo, don't move.
- Unh! Unh!

74
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:56,856
You'll never get out
of there yourself.

75
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,991
I'll do it. Unh!

76
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,991
- You feel a break?
- No.

77
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,827
Sometimes you can't tell
'cause fluid rushes to the area.

78
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,002
- Are you woozy?
- No.

79
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:07,367
- How many stripes do I have?
- I'm fine.

80
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:09,055
- Answer the stripe question.
- Three.

81
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,673
No! See?
Something's wrong with you.

82
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,549
I have one, two, three-
That's all I have?

83
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:16,469
You're OK.
How's the lucky fin?

84
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:19,300
- Lucky.
- Let's see.

85
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,225
Are you sure you want to go
to school this year?

86
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,220
There's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

87
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,101
Come on, Dad,
it's time for school.

88
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,776
- Forgot to brush.
- Ohh.

89
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:31,861
Do you want this anemone
to sting you?

90
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:34,237
- Yes.
- Brush.

91
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:35,982
- OK, I'm done.
- You missed a spot.

92
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:37,958
- Where?
- There.

93
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:40,993
Ha ha! Right there.
And here and here.

94
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:51,090
All right, we're excited.

95
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,890
The first day of school.
Here we go.

96
00:06:52,924 --> 00:06:54,891
We're ready to learn
to get some knowledge.

97
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:57,386
What's the one thing we have
to remember about the ocean?

98
00:06:57,421 --> 00:06:59,811
- It's not safe.
- That's my boy.

99
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,147
First, we check to see
that the coast is clear.

100
00:07:02,182 --> 00:07:04,572
We go out... and back in.

101
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:06,903
And then we go out...
and back in.

102
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:09,954
And then one more time-
out and back in.

103
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:11,859
And sometimes, if you want
to do it four times-

104
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:14,279
- Dad...
- All right, come on, boy.

105
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,045
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

106
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,791
- I highly doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?

107
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:24,425
No, and I don't plan to.

108
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,712
- How old are sea turtles?
- I don't know.

109
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,427
Sandy Plankton
from next door...

110
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:34,853
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

111
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,996
If I ever meet a sea turtle,
I'll ask him.

112
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:39,104
After I'm done
talking to the shark, OK?

113
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,735
Whoa! Hold on.
Wait to cross.

114
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,949
Hold my fin.

115
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:46,676
Dad, you're not
going to freak out...

116
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:48,952
like you did at
the petting zoo, are you?

117
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:51,327
That snail was about to charge.

118
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:53,667
Hmm. I wonder where
we're supposed to go.

119
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:55,132
Bye, Mom!

120
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,337
I'll pick you up after school.

121
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:59,013
Ha ha!

122
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:02,168
Come on, you guys, stop it!
Give it back!

123
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:05,178
Come on,
we'll try over there.

124
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:08,599
Excuse me, is this where
we meet his teacher?

125
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:11,179
Well, look who's out
of the anemone.

126
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:12,723
Yes. Shocking, I know.

127
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,231
- Marty, right?
- Marlin.

128
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:15,366
- Bob.
- Ted.

129
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:17,406
Bill.
Hey, you're a clownfish.

130
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,031
You're funny, right?
Tell us a joke.

131
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,327
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

132
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:24,117
Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

133
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:26,873
Clownfish are no funnier
than any other fish.

134
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:28,912
- Come on, clownie.
- Do something funny.

135
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:31,378
All right, I know one joke.

136
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:35,544
There's a mollusk, see?
And he walks up to a sea-

137
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:37,562
He doesn't walk up,
he swims up.

138
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:39,510
Actually,
the mollusk isn't moving.

139
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:43,136
He's in one place,
and then the sea cucumber...

140
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:44,601
Well, they-I'm mixed up.

141
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:47,362
There was a mollusk
and a sea cucumber.

142
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:50,259
None of them were walking,
so forget that I-

143
00:08:50,294 --> 00:08:52,276
Sheldon! Get out of
Mr. Johannsen's yard now!

144
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:54,697
- Whoa!
- All right, you kids!

145
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,743
Ooh, where'd you go?

146
00:08:57,777 --> 00:08:59,953
Dad, can I go play, too?
Can I?

147
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:03,038
I would feel better if
you'd play on the sponge beds.

148
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,580
That's where I would play.

149
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,631
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.

150
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,017
Ow! Hey, what'd I do?

151
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:18,017
Be nice.
It's his first time at school.

152
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:20,802
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

153
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,068
- Dad...
- See this tentacle?

154
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:25,272
It's actually shorter
than all my other tentacles...

155
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,408
but you can't really tell.

156
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:29,904
Especially when
I twirl them like this.

157
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:31,949
I'm H-2-O intolerant.

158
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:33,985
- Ah-choo!
- I'm obnoxious.

159
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,580
Oh

160
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:38,496
Let's name the zones,
the zones, the zones

161
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,666
Let's name
the zones of the open sea

162
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,881
Mr. Ray!

163
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,837
- Come on, Nemo.
- You better stay with me.

164
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:47,722
Mesopelagic, bathyal,
abyssalpelagic

165
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:51,217
All the rest are too deep
for you and me to see

166
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:54,598
Huh. I wonder where
my class has gone?

167
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,451
We're under here!

168
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:58,234
Oh, there you are.

169
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,730
Climb aboard, explorers.

170
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,190
Oh, knowledge
exploring

171
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,695
Is, oh, so lyrical

172
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,191
When you think thoughts
that are empirical

173
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:06,366
Dad, you can go now.

174
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,497
- Hello. Who is this?
- I'm Nemo.

175
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:13,241
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

176
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:16,082
- OK.
- You live in what kind of home?

177
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,975
An anemon-none.

178
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,798
A nemenem-menome.

179
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,923
OK, don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.

180
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,776
Just so you know,
he's got a little fin.

181
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:26,702
I find if he's having
trouble swimming...

182
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:28,896
I let him take a break,
10, 15 minutes.

183
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:31,020
Dad, it's time
for you to go now.

184
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:33,186
Don't worry. We're gonna
stay together as a group.

185
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:35,571
OK, class,
optical orbits up front.

186
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:38,647
And remember, we keep
our supraesophogeal ganglion...

187
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:41,107
to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.

188
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,117
Aw, man!

189
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:44,884
Bye, Nemo!

190
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,624
Bye, Dad!

191
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,328
Bye, son!

192
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,294
Be safe.

193
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,814
You're doing pretty well
for a first-timer.

194
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,265
You can't hold on to them
forever, can you?

195
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,590
I had a tough time with
my oldest out at the drop off.

196
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,846
They got to grow up-
The drop off?

197
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:04,991
They're going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?

198
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:08,101
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

199
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:09,356
Hey, Marty, calm down.

200
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:11,732
Don't tell me
to be calm, pony boy.

201
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:14,028
Pony boy?

202
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:16,944
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

203
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:18,631
Pity.

204
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:20,249
Oh

205
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:22,904
Let's name the species,
the species, the species

206
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:24,245
Let's name the species
that live in the sea

207
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,782
Whoa.

208
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:27,210
There's

209
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:29,376
Porifera, coelenterata,
hydrozoa, scyphozoa

210
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,793
Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three

211
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:34,176
Gastropoda, arthropoda,
echinoderma

212
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:35,507
And some fish
like you and me

213
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,887
Come on, sing with me.

214
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:39,258
Oh

215
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:45,979
Just the girls this time.

216
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:47,979
Oh, seaweed is cool

217
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:49,416
Seaweed is fun

218
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:50,819
It makes its food

219
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:56,075
OK, the drop off.

220
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,451
All right, kids,
feel free to explore...

221
00:11:58,486 --> 00:11:59,587
but stay close.

222
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:01,871
Stromalitic
cyanobacteria! Gather.

223
00:12:03,162 --> 00:12:05,961
An entire ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimal speck.

224
00:12:05,997 --> 00:12:07,633
There are as many protein pairs
contained in this...

225
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:09,590
Come on, let's go.

226
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,478
Come on, sing with me!

227
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:13,843
There's porifera,
coelenterata

228
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,268
Hydrozoa, scyphozoa

229
00:12:15,304 --> 00:12:16,933
Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three

230
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,975
Hey, guys, wait up!

231
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,315
Whoa.

232
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:27,027
Cool.

233
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:30,291
Saved your life!

234
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:32,697
Aw, you guys made me ink.

235
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:35,577
What's that?

236
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:40,038
I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

237
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:43,169
He said it was called a butt.

238
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:44,634
- Whoa.
- Wow.

239
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,009
That's a pretty big butt.

240
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:51,681
Oh, look at me.
I'm going to touch the butt.

241
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:54,146
- Ah-choo! Whoa!
- Ha ha ha!

242
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:57,022
Oh, yeah?
Let's see you get closer.

243
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:58,657
OK.

244
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:01,158
Beat that.

245
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:03,784
Come on, Nemo.
How far can you go?

246
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:06,283
My dad says it's not safe.

247
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,209
- Nemo! No!
- Dad?

248
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:10,745
You were about
to swim into open water.

249
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,960
No, I wasn't-

250
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:14,080
Good thing I was here.
If I hadn't shown up-

251
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:16,165
- He wasn't going to go.
- He was too afraid.

252
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:17,471
No, I wasn't.

253
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,931
This does not
concern you, kids...

254
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,385
and you're lucky
I don't tell your parents.

255
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,048
You know you can't swim well.

256
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,642
I can swim fine, Dad, OK?

257
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:27,562
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't be near here.

258
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:30,203
OK, I was right. You'll start
school in a year or two.

259
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:32,808
No, Dad! Just because
you're scared of the ocean-

260
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:33,984
Clearly, you're not ready...

261
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,228
and you're not coming back
until you are.

262
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:36,529
You think
you can do these things...

263
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:38,450
but you just can't, Nemo!

264
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:41,410
I hate you.

265
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,206
There's

266
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,826
Nothing to see.
Gather. Over there.

267
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:48,376
Excuse me.
Is there anything I can do?

268
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,521
I am a scientist, sir.
Is there any problem?

269
00:13:50,557 --> 00:13:52,597
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt things.

270
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,502
He isn't a good swimmer,
and it's a little too soon...

271
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:57,228
for him to be out here
unsupervised.

272
00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:59,058
I can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

273
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:02,034
I'm sure he is,
but you have a large class...

274
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:04,974
and he can get lost from sight
if you're not looking.

275
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:06,149
I'm not saying
you're not looking.

276
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:09,144
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea!

277
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:12,235
Nemo!

278
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:15,886
What do you think you're doing?

279
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,122
You'll get stuck out there...

280
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,707
and I'll have to get you
before another fish does.

281
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:23,593
Get back here!

282
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:26,633
I said get back here now!

283
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:31,549
Stop! You take
one more move, mister...

284
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,434
Don't you dare!

285
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:35,549
If you put one fin
on that boat...

286
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,177
Are you listening to me?

287
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,771
Don't touch the bo-Nemo!

288
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:45,191
You paddle your little tail
right back here, Nemo.

289
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:46,366
That's right.

290
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:48,153
You are in big trouble,
young man.

291
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,992
Do you hear me? Big...

292
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:53,743
- Big...
- Aah!

293
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,918
Aah!

294
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:59,499
Daddy! Help me!

295
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:02,045
I'm coming, Nemo!

296
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,295
- Aah!
- Get under me, kids!

297
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,715
Aah! Oh! No!

298
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,818
Dad!

299
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:10,886
Daddy!

300
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:17,018
Oh! Nemo!

301
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:21,403
Unh. Nemo!

302
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:24,778
Nemo, no! Nemo!

303
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:28,119
Nemo! Nemo! No!

304
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:32,725
No!

305
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,461
Aah!

306
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,841
Uhh.

307
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:42,962
Nemo! Nemo!

308
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:54,485
Whoa! Hold on.

309
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:08,461
Oh, no.

310
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:10,478
No. No, it's gone.
It's gone.

311
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,457
No, no,
it can't be gone.

312
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:14,479
No, no! Nemo!

313
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,088
Nemo! Nemo!

314
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,349
No!

315
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:23,024
Nemo! Nemo!

316
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:25,890
No! No, please, no!

317
00:16:28,651 --> 00:16:29,901
No, no!

318
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:33,732
Has anybody seen a boat?

319
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:35,584
Please! A white boat!

320
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,366
They took my son!

321
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:39,952
My son! Help me, please.

322
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,832
- Look out!
- What?

323
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,258
Ooh. Ohh.

324
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:47,774
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry.
I didn't see you.

325
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:51,254
- Sir? Are you OK?
- He's gone, he's gone.

326
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:52,646
There, there.
It's all right.

327
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:53,970
- He's gone.
- It'll be OK.

328
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:57,636
No, no. They took him away.
I have to find the boat.

329
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,691
A boat?
Hey, I've seen a boat.

330
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:02,057
- You have?
- It passed by not too long ago.

331
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:04,477
- A white one?
- Hi. I'm Dory.

332
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:05,653
Where? Which way?

333
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:07,522
Oh, oh, oh.
It went this way.

334
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:09,282
It went this way.
Follow me.

335
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:12,738
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you so much.

336
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:13,908
No problem.

337
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,523
Hey...

338
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:41,944
Wait!

339
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:50,120
- Will you quit it?
- What?

340
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:52,956
I'm trying to swim here.
Ocean isn't big enough for you?

341
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,453
You got a problem, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

342
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,916
Do you? Do you?
You want a piece of me?

343
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,801
Ooh, I'm scared now. What?

344
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:02,737
- Wait a minute.
- Stop following me, OK?

345
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:05,638
What? You're showing me
where the boat went.

346
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:07,259
A boat?
Hey, I've seen a boat.

347
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:10,728
It passed by not too long ago.
It went this way.

348
00:18:10,763 --> 00:18:12,536
It went this way.
Follow me.

349
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:14,275
Wait a minute.
What is going on?

350
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,649
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

351
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:19,865
I did? Oh, no.

352
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,241
If this is some kind of
practical joke, it's not funny.

353
00:18:22,277 --> 00:18:24,536
And I know funny.
I'm a clownfish.

354
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,788
No, it's not. I know it's not.
I'm so sorry.

355
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:31,353
See, I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

356
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:34,090
Short-term memory loss.
I don't believe this.

357
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,445
No, it's true. I forget things
almost instantly.

358
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,764
It runs in my family.
At least, I think it does.

359
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,845
Um, hmm. Where are they?

360
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:50,941
Can I help you?

361
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:53,696
Something's wrong
with you-really.

362
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:55,714
You're wasting my time.

363
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:57,697
I have to find my son.

364
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:02,464
Hello.

365
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:04,539
- Ohh.
- Well, hi!

366
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:07,594
Name's Bruce.

367
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:09,420
It's all right.
I understand.

368
00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:13,171
Why trust a shark, right?

369
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:23,352
So, what's a couple
of bites like you...

370
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:25,027
doing out so late, eh?

371
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:27,153
We're not doing anything.
We're not even out.

372
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:29,368
Great!
Then how'd you morsels...

373
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:32,693
like to come to a little
get-together I'm having?

374
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:33,910
You mean, like a party?

375
00:19:33,944 --> 00:19:37,095
Yeah, right. A party.
What do you say?

376
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:39,917
I love parties.
That sounds like fun.

377
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:42,705
Parties are fun,
and it's tempting, but-

378
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:46,592
Oh, come on, I insist.

379
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:49,886
OK.
That's all that matters.

380
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,643
Hey, look, balloons.
It is a party.

381
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:57,058
Ha ha ha ha!
Mind your distance, though.

382
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:59,580
Those balloons
can be a bit dodgy.

383
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,068
You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

384
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:12,581
Oh.

385
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:15,042
Ohh.

386
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:18,637
Anchor! Chum!

387
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:21,468
There you are, Bruce.
Finally.

388
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:23,298
- We got company.
- It's about time, mate.

389
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:25,712
We've already gone
through the snacks...

390
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:27,269
and I'm still starving.

391
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:29,304
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

392
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:31,305
Come on,
let's get this over with.

393
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:34,111
Right, then.

394
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:36,485
The meeting has officially
come to order.

395
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,990
Let us all say the pledge.

396
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:42,567
I am a nice shark,
not a mindless eating machine.

397
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:45,149
If I am to change this image...

398
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:47,821
I must first change myself.

399
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:49,842
Fish are friends, not food.

400
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:51,793
Except stinkin' dolphins.

401
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:54,248
Dolphins. Yeah.
They think they're so cute.

402
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:56,331
Look at me.
I'm a flippin' little dolphin.

403
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,687
Let me flip for you.
Ain't I something?

404
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:01,009
Right, then.
Today's meeting is Step 5-

405
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:02,684
Bring a Fish Friend.

406
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,261
Do you all have your friends?

407
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,430
Got mine.

408
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:09,396
- Hey, there.
- How about you, Chum?

409
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:14,023
Oh, I... seem to have
misplaced my friend.

410
00:21:15,612 --> 00:21:16,948
That's all right, Chum.

411
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:18,548
I had a feeling
this would be a difficult step.

412
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,103
You can help yourself
to one of my friends.

413
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:23,624
Thanks, mate.
A little chum for Chum, eh?

414
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,641
I'll start
the testimonies.

415
00:21:25,677 --> 00:21:27,625
Hello. My name is Bruce.

416
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,879
Hello, Bruce.

417
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:31,090
It has been three weeks
since my last fish.

418
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,586
On my honor, or may I be
chopped up and made into soup.

419
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:37,387
- You're an inspiration!
- Amen.

420
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,993
Right, then. Who's next?

421
00:21:40,028 --> 00:21:41,352
Pick me, pick me.

422
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,307
Yes. The little
Sheila down the front.

423
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,398
- Whoo!
- Come on up here.

424
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:48,194
Hi. I'm Dory.

425
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:51,044
- Hello, Dory.
- And, uh, well...

426
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:54,284
I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

427
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,490
- That's incredible.
- Good on you, mate.

428
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,540
I'm glad
I got that off my chest.

429
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:00,876
All right, anyone else?

430
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:03,541
How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

431
00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:05,831
Me?
I don't have a problem.

432
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,176
Oh, OK.

433
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:08,807
- Denial.
- Aah!

434
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:10,712
Just start
with your name.

435
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,438
OK. Uh, hello.

436
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:16,579
My name is Marlin.
I'm a clownfish.

437
00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:19,684
- A clownfish? Really?
- Tell us a joke.

438
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,400
I love jokes.

439
00:22:21,435 --> 00:22:24,485
I actually do know one
that's pretty good.

440
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,490
There was this mollusk...

441
00:22:26,524 --> 00:22:28,870
and he walks up
to a sea cucumber.

442
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:30,786
Normally, they don't talk,
sea cucumbers...

443
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:32,752
but in a joke,
everyone talks...

444
00:22:32,787 --> 00:22:35,867
so the sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

445
00:22:37,537 --> 00:22:39,563
Daddy!

446
00:22:39,598 --> 00:22:41,512
Nemo!

447
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:44,068
Nemo! Ha ha! Nemo!
I don't get it.

448
00:22:44,103 --> 00:22:46,588
For a clownfish,
he's not that funny.

449
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:48,592
No, no, no, no.
He's my son.

450
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:50,560
He was taken by these divers.

451
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,270
Humans-think they own
everything.

452
00:22:55,305 --> 00:22:56,525
Probably American.

453
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,731
Now, there is a father-
Looking for his little boy.

454
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:03,281
What do
these markings mean?

455
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:08,123
- Group hug.
- We're all mates here, mate.

456
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:09,339
I can't read human.

457
00:23:09,374 --> 00:23:11,019
We got to find a fish
that can read this.

458
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:12,664
- Hey, look, sharks.
- No, no, no, Dory!

459
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:14,455
- Guys, guys.
- No, Dory.

460
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,215
That's mine.
Give it to me.

461
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,680
Gimme! Ow!

462
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:19,715
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you OK?

463
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:21,100
- Ow, ow, ow.
- I'm so sorry.

464
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:23,306
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

465
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,093
- Ohh.
- Ow, ow, ow.

466
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:27,908
Dory, are you OK-Ohh.

467
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:31,150
Ohh, that's good.

468
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:34,322
Intervention!

469
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:37,009
- Just a bite.
- Hold it together, mate!

470
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:39,659
Remember, Bruce,
fish are friends, not food!

471
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:42,584
- Food!
- Dory, look out!

472
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:46,200
- Aah!
- I'm having fish tonight!

473
00:23:46,235 --> 00:23:47,830
Remember the steps, mate!

474
00:23:47,865 --> 00:23:50,386
Aah!

475
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:53,171
- Aah! Whoa!
- Aah!

476
00:23:53,207 --> 00:23:55,922
- Just one bite!
- Aah!

477
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:02,764
G'day. Grr!

478
00:24:03,763 --> 00:24:05,028
There's no way out!

479
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:06,854
There's got to be a way
to escape!

480
00:24:09,024 --> 00:24:10,319
Who is it?

481
00:24:10,354 --> 00:24:11,739
Dory, help me
find a way out!

482
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:14,325
Sorry. Come back later.
We're trying to escape.

483
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:18,955
- There's got to be a way out!
- Here's something.

484
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,138
Es-cap-e.
I wonder what that means.

485
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:23,287
Funny. It's spelled
just like escape.

486
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:24,586
- Let's go.
- Aah!

487
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:27,673
Here's Brucey!

488
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,433
Wait a minute.
You can read?

489
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,509
I can read?
That's right. I can read!

490
00:24:31,544 --> 00:24:33,678
Well, then, here.
Read this now.

491
00:24:33,713 --> 00:24:35,644
- Aah!
- Ohh!

492
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,480
He really doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

493
00:24:38,515 --> 00:24:39,729
Don't fall off the wagon!

494
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:41,350
- Aah!
- Aah!

495
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,231
Oh, no, it's blocked!

496
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:51,747
No, Bruce, focus.

497
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:54,222
Sorry about Bruce, mate.

498
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:56,084
He's really a nice guy.

499
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,831
I need to get that mask.

500
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,119
You want that mask? OK.

501
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:02,539
No, no, no, no, no, no!

502
00:25:02,574 --> 00:25:04,924
Quick, grab the mask!

503
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:11,636
Oh, no. Bruce?

504
00:25:11,671 --> 00:25:13,306
What?

505
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:19,648
Aw, is the party over?

506
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:30,949
Nice.

507
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,210
Dad?

508
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,210
Daddy?

509
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:42,671
Huh?

510
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:47,052
Aah! Uhh!

511
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:50,723
Uhh!

512
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:04,000
- Barbara.
- Uh-huh?

513
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:06,205
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

514
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:08,376
And I'm going to need
a few more cotton rolls.

515
00:26:08,411 --> 00:26:10,046
OK.

516
00:26:11,757 --> 00:26:13,507
Hello, little fella.

517
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:14,722
Aah!

518
00:26:14,757 --> 00:26:15,893
Heh heh heh!
Beauty, isn't he?

519
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:17,298
I found that guy
struggling for life...

520
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,255
out on the reef,
and I saved him.

521
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:21,859
So, has that Novocaine
kicked in yet?

522
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:24,429
I think so.
We're ready to roll.

523
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,189
Bubbles!

524
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,744
My bubbles.

525
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,345
He likes bubbles.

526
00:26:34,381 --> 00:26:36,911
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

527
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:45,878
- Bonjour.
- Aah!

528
00:26:45,912 --> 00:26:49,753
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

529
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:53,005
- He's scared to death.
- I want to go home.

530
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,059
Do you know where my dad is?

531
00:26:55,094 --> 00:26:57,885
Honey, your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

532
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,060
Pet store?

533
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:01,815
Yeah, you know, like,
I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

534
00:27:01,851 --> 00:27:03,435
- Pet Palace.
- Fish-O-Rama.

535
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,900
- Mail order.
- Ebay.

536
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:07,646
- So, which one is it?
- I'm from the ocean.

537
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:09,657
Ah, the ocean. The ocean?

538
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:11,542
Aah! Aah! Aah!

539
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:14,328
He hasn't been decontaminated.
Jacques!

540
00:27:14,363 --> 00:27:15,698
- Oui.
- Clean him!

541
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:17,213
Oui.

542
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:19,708
- Ocean.
- Ooh, la mer. Bon.

543
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:23,670
Voila. He is clean.

544
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,430
Wow. The big blue.
What's it like?

545
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:33,476
- Big and blue?
- I knew it.

546
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:36,681
If there's anything you need,
just ask your Auntie Deb.

547
00:27:36,717 --> 00:27:39,853
Or if I'm not around,
you can talk to my sister Flo.

548
00:27:39,888 --> 00:27:41,657
Hi. How are you?

549
00:27:41,692 --> 00:27:43,233
Don't listen to anything
my sister says.

550
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:45,114
She's nuts.
Ha ha ha ha!

551
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:46,198
We got a live one.

552
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:49,324
- Can't hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.

553
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,290
- Boy, oh, boy.
- What do we got?

554
00:27:51,325 --> 00:27:52,874
Root canal-and by the looks
of those x-rays...

555
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:54,415
it's not going to be pretty.

556
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,091
Ow!

557
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:57,551
- Dam and clamp installed?
- Yep.

558
00:27:57,586 --> 00:27:59,416
- What did he use to open?
- Gator-Glidden drill.

559
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:01,126
He seems to favor
that one lately.

560
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:04,061
I can't see, Flo.

561
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:06,222
You're getting
a little too-Aah!

562
00:28:06,257 --> 00:28:07,593
Now he's doing
the Schilder technique.

563
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:08,893
He's using
a Hedstrom file.

564
00:28:08,928 --> 00:28:11,153
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

565
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,858
It has a teardrop cross-section.
Clearly a Hedstrom.

566
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:15,400
- No, no, K-Flex.
- Hedstrom.

567
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:17,075
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!

568
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,240
There I go.
A little help, over here.

569
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,111
I'll go deflate him.

570
00:28:23,531 --> 00:28:26,326
All right.
Go ahead and rinse.

571
00:28:26,362 --> 00:28:29,122
Oh, the human mouth
is a disgusting place.

572
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,462
- Hey, Nigel.
- What did I miss?

573
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:34,638
Root canal-a doozy.

574
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,308
Root canal?
What did he use to open?

575
00:28:36,343 --> 00:28:38,388
- Gator-Glidden drill.
- He's favoring that one.

576
00:28:38,423 --> 00:28:41,424
Hope he doesn't get surplus
sealer at the portal terminus.

577
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:44,594
- Hello. Who's this?
- New guy. Ha ha ha!

578
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:45,899
The dentist
took him off the reef.

579
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:48,356
An outie. From my neck
of the woods, eh?

580
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:49,853
Sorry if I ever took
a snap at you.

581
00:28:49,887 --> 00:28:51,316
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat.

582
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,031
Hey! No, no, no, no!

583
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,696
They're not your fish.
They're my fish.

584
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,526
Come on, go.
Go on, shoo!

585
00:28:58,826 --> 00:29:00,502
Aw, the picture broke.

586
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:02,352
This here's Darla.
She's my niece.

587
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:04,168
She's going to be
eight this week.

588
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:05,593
Hey, little fella.

589
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:07,422
Say hello
to your new mummy.

590
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:09,649
She'll be here Friday
to pick you up.

591
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:11,839
You're her present.
Shh, shh, shh.

592
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:13,895
It's our little secret.

593
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,720
Well, Mr. Tucker,
while that sets up...

594
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,511
I'm going to see a man
about a wallaby.

595
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,186
Oh, Darla.

596
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:23,106
What?
What's wrong with her?

597
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:25,817
She wouldn't stop
shaking the bag.

598
00:29:25,852 --> 00:29:28,962
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.

599
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:32,073
Hitched a ride
on the porcelain express.

600
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:36,128
She's a fish killer.

601
00:29:36,163 --> 00:29:38,204
I can't go with that girl.

602
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,244
I have to get back
to my dad.

603
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:44,215
Aah! Daddy! Help me!

604
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,340
Oh, he's stuck.

605
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,636
Nobody touch him.

606
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:51,887
Nobody touch him.

607
00:29:57,557 --> 00:29:58,982
Can you help me?

608
00:29:59,018 --> 00:30:01,068
No. You got yourself
in there.

609
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:02,743
You can get yourself out.

610
00:30:02,778 --> 00:30:05,034
- Gill-
- I want to see him do it.

611
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:08,949
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

612
00:30:08,984 --> 00:30:11,790
I can't. I have a bad fin.

613
00:30:11,824 --> 00:30:14,000
Never stopped me.

614
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,632
Just think about
what you need to do.

615
00:30:24,553 --> 00:30:26,133
Come on.

616
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:31,529
Perfect.

617
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:32,899
- Yay!
- You did it!

618
00:30:32,935 --> 00:30:34,689
Good squirming.
Ha ha ha!

619
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:38,406
Wow. From the ocean-
just like you, Gill.

620
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,565
Yeah.

621
00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:43,697
What are you thinking about?

622
00:30:43,731 --> 00:30:45,461
I'm thinking...

623
00:30:45,496 --> 00:30:49,077
tonight, we give the kid
a proper reception.

624
00:30:49,112 --> 00:30:50,787
So, kid,
you got a name or what?

625
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:53,548
Nemo. I'm Nemo.

626
00:30:55,628 --> 00:30:58,128
Nemo. Nemo.

627
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,059
Are you gonna eat that?

628
00:31:16,572 --> 00:31:20,282
- Careful with that hammer.
- Huh?

629
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:25,509
No, no.

630
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:27,759
What does it say? Dory!

631
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:29,794
A sea monkey has my money.

632
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:31,795
Wake up. Get up. Come on.

633
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,759
Come on!

634
00:31:32,794 --> 00:31:35,550
- Yes, I'm a natural blue.
- Get up!

635
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:38,305
Look out!
Sharks eat fish! Aah!

636
00:31:42,437 --> 00:31:44,397
- Aah!
- Aah!

637
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:52,569
Aah!

638
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,466
Wow. Dusty.

639
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,040
The mask.
Where's the mask?

640
00:32:05,671 --> 00:32:07,596
No! No, not the mask!

641
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:10,172
Get it! Get the mask!
Get the mask! Get it!

642
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:16,853
Hoo doot doo doot
doot doo doot

643
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:18,278
Whoo-hoo!

644
00:32:18,314 --> 00:32:19,858
La la la la la la

645
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,694
It just keeps going on,
doesn't it?

646
00:32:21,728 --> 00:32:24,069
Echo! Echo!

647
00:32:24,104 --> 00:32:25,329
Hey, what you doing?

648
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:27,050
It's gone.
I've lost the mask.

649
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:28,699
- Did you drop it?
- You dropped it!

650
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:30,365
That was my only chance
of finding my son.

651
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,745
Now it's gone.

652
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,172
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills...

653
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,837
when life gets you down,
know what you got to do?

654
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:43,298
- I don't want to know.
- Just keep swimming.

655
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:46,758
Just keep swimming,
swimming, swimming

656
00:32:46,793 --> 00:32:49,059
What do we do?
We swim, swim

657
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:50,616
Dory, no singing.

658
00:32:50,651 --> 00:32:52,711
Ho ho ho ho ho ho

659
00:32:52,746 --> 00:32:54,735
I love to swim

660
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,196
When you want to swim

661
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,271
See, I'm going to get
stuck now with that song.

662
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:03,571
- Now it's in my head.
- Sorry.

663
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,956
Dory, do you see anything?

664
00:33:04,992 --> 00:33:06,742
- Aah! Something's got me.
- That was me. I'm sorry.

665
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:10,162
- Who's that?
- Who could it be? It's me.

666
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:13,429
Are you my conscience?

667
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:16,279
Yeah, yeah.
I'm your conscience.

668
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:19,095
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

669
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,131
- Can't complain.
- Yeah? Good.

670
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,135
Now, Dory,
I want you to tell me-

671
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:25,863
Do you see anything?

672
00:33:25,898 --> 00:33:28,522
I see a... I see a light.

673
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:31,112
- A light?
- Yeah. Over there.

674
00:33:31,147 --> 00:33:34,647
- Hey, conscience, am I dead?
- No. I see it, too.

675
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:45,729
What is it?

676
00:33:45,764 --> 00:33:49,135
It's so pretty.

677
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:53,361
I'm feeling... happy...

678
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:57,552
which is a big deal for me.

679
00:33:57,587 --> 00:33:59,092
I want to touch it.

680
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:00,606
- Oh.
- Ooh.

681
00:34:00,642 --> 00:34:03,103
Hey, come back.
Come on back here.

682
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:04,809
I'm gonna get you

683
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:06,448
I'm gonna get you.

684
00:34:06,483 --> 00:34:07,813
I'm gonna swim with you

685
00:34:07,848 --> 00:34:09,158
I'm gonna get you.

686
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:12,114
I'm gonna be
your best friend

687
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:13,324
Good feeling's gone.

688
00:34:15,904 --> 00:34:17,615
- Whoa!
- Waah!

689
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,916
I can't see!
I don't know where I'm going!

690
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:24,762
Haah!

691
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:26,962
- The mask!
- What mask?

692
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:29,127
OK, I can't see a thing.

693
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:32,848
- Oh, gee.
- Hey, look, a mask.

694
00:34:32,884 --> 00:34:34,473
Read it!

695
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:36,143
I'm sorry,
but if you could just...

696
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:38,178
bring it a little closer,
I kind of need the light.

697
00:34:38,213 --> 00:34:41,149
That's great.
Keep it right there.

698
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:43,900
- Just read it!
- OK, OK.

699
00:34:43,935 --> 00:34:46,963
Mr. Bossy. Uh, P.

700
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:49,956
OK. P. Sher...

701
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:53,121
Sher-P. Sher-
P. Shirley? P.-

702
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,267
Oh. The first line's
P. Sherman.

703
00:34:57,302 --> 00:34:59,542
P. Sherman
doesn't make any sense!

704
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:01,799
OK. Second line. 42.

705
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,843
Don't eat me.
Don't eat me. Aah!

706
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:07,174
Light, please!

707
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:11,059
Walla-walla-

708
00:35:11,095 --> 00:35:14,020
Waah! Waah! Waah!

709
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:15,820
The second line's
42 Wallaby Way.

710
00:35:15,856 --> 00:35:18,105
That's great.
Speed read. Take a guess.

711
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,356
No pressure. No problem.
There's a lot of pressure.

712
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:22,907
Pressure! Take a guess
now with pressure!

713
00:35:22,942 --> 00:35:26,077
- Sydney! It's Sydney!
- Duck!

714
00:35:26,112 --> 00:35:28,003
Aah!

715
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:31,458
I'm dead.
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

716
00:35:31,493 --> 00:35:32,869
I died. I'm dead.

717
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,185
Whoo-hoo!

718
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,991
We did it, we did it

719
00:35:43,025 --> 00:35:44,725
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

720
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:46,411
No eating here
tonight, whoo!

721
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:48,026
Eating here tonight

722
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:49,391
No, no, no,
eating here tonight

723
00:35:49,426 --> 00:35:50,856
- Dory.
- You on a diet

724
00:35:50,891 --> 00:35:53,737
Dory!
What did the mask say?

725
00:35:53,772 --> 00:35:55,653
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

726
00:35:57,773 --> 00:36:00,324
I usually forget things,
but I remembered it!

727
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,999
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Where is that?

728
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:04,494
I don't know.
But who cares? I remembered.

729
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,709
- Raar!
- Aah!

730
00:36:05,744 --> 00:36:07,995
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

731
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,085
I remembered it again!

732
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,075
Psst. Nemo.

733
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,636
Mmm...

734
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:44,126
Nemo

735
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:47,041
- Huh?
- Suivez-moi.

736
00:36:49,172 --> 00:36:50,803
Follow me.

737
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:05,491
Ha hwa ha

738
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:16,176
Ha hwa ha ho ho ho

739
00:37:34,216 --> 00:37:36,655

Hoo!

744
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:50,073
State your name.

745
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,169
Nemo.

746
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:54,584
Brother Bloat, proceed.

747
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:59,625
Nemo, newcomer
of orange and white...

748
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:00,970
you have been called forth...

749
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:03,561
to the summit of
Mount Wannahockaloogie...

750
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:08,977
to join with us in
the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

751
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:11,898
- Huh?
- We want you in our club, kid.

752
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:13,073
- Really?
- If...

753
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:16,438
you are able to swim through...

754
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:26,180
Turn on the Ring of Fire!

755
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:27,951
You said you could do it.

756
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:29,581
The Ring of Fire!

757
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:34,401
Bubbles, let me-Oh!

758
00:38:34,436 --> 00:38:39,607
Ha hwa ha ho ho ho

759
00:38:41,643 --> 00:38:44,763
Isn't there another way?
He's just a boy!

760
00:38:55,116 --> 00:39:00,246
From this moment on,
you will be known as Sharkbait.

761
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:01,581
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

762
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:03,418
Welcome,
Brother Sharkbait.

763
00:39:03,453 --> 00:39:04,632
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

764
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,748
- Enough with the Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait!

765
00:39:06,783 --> 00:39:08,632
Ooh... ba-ba-do.

766
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:10,223
Sharkbait's
one of us now, agreed?

767
00:39:10,258 --> 00:39:12,338
- Agreed.
- We can't send him to his death.

768
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:14,235
Darla's coming in five days.

769
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,065
So, what are we going to do?

770
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,205
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do-

771
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,275
we're gonna get him
out of here.

772
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,851
- We'll help him escape.
- Escape? Really?

773
00:39:22,886 --> 00:39:24,316
We're all gonna escape.

774
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:27,021
Gill, please.
Not another escape plan.

775
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:28,668
Sorry,
but they just never work.

776
00:39:28,704 --> 00:39:30,692
Why should this
be any different?

777
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:33,359
- Because we've got him.
- Me?

778
00:39:33,394 --> 00:39:35,918
- You see that filter?
- Yeah.

779
00:39:35,953 --> 00:39:39,413
You're the only one who can get
in and out of that thing.

780
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:42,624
We need you to take
a pebble inside there...

781
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:43,839
and jam the gears.

782
00:39:43,874 --> 00:39:45,925
You do that,
and this tank's gonna get...

783
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,850
filthier and filthier
by the minute.

784
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,556
Pretty soon, the dentist'll
have to clean the tank...

785
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,226
and when he does, he'll take us
out of the tank...

786
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:54,772
put us in
individual baggies...

787
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:56,647
then we'll roll ourselves
down the counter...

788
00:39:56,682 --> 00:39:58,375
out the window,
off the awning...

789
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:00,068
into the bushes,
across the street...

790
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:02,533
and into the harbor!

791
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:05,529
It's foolproof.
Who's with me?

792
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:06,914
- Aye!
- Aye!

793
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:08,449
I think you're nuts.

794
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:12,450
No offense, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

795
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:14,836
He's fine. He can do this.

796
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:18,381
So, Sharkbait,
what do you think?

797
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:23,267
Let's do it.

798
00:40:23,302 --> 00:40:26,302
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

799
00:40:26,337 --> 00:40:27,607
Where are you going?

800
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:29,353
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

801
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:30,977
If you ask
where I'm going...

802
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,663
I'll tell you
that's where I'm going.

803
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:34,401
It's P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

804
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:36,065
Where? I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.

805
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,693
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

806
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:40,489
Excuse me.

807
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:42,330
Hi.
Do you know how to get-

808
00:40:42,365 --> 00:40:45,330
Hello? Whoa. Wait.
Can you tell me-

809
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:49,267
Hey! Hold it!
I'm trying to talk to you!

810
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:53,167
Fellas, come back here.
One quick question.

811
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:57,553
I need to-
And they're gone again.

812
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,353
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

813
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:01,263
Why do I have to tell you
over and over again?

814
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:03,139
I'll tell you again.
I don't get tired of it-

815
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:04,616
- OK, all right.
- Huh?

816
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:06,024
- Here's the thing.
- Uh-huh.

817
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:11,610
I think it's best
if I carry on from here by...

818
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:13,020
by myself.

819
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,196
OK.

820
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,956
- You know, alone.
- Uh-huh.

821
00:41:15,991 --> 00:41:18,031
Without-without-
I mean, not without you.

822
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:21,452
But I don't
want you... with me.

823
00:41:21,487 --> 00:41:23,798
- Huh?
- Am I...

824
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:24,968
I don't want to hurt
your feelings.

825
00:41:25,003 --> 00:41:27,669
- You want me to leave?
- I mean, not-Yes.

826
00:41:27,704 --> 00:41:30,299
I just can't afford
any more delays...

827
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:33,554
and you're one of those fish
that cause delays.

828
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,179
Sometimes it's a good thing.

829
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:38,304
There's a whole group of fish.
They're delay fish.

830
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:39,851
You mean...

831
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:41,661
You mean you don't like me?

832
00:41:41,695 --> 00:41:43,401
No, of course I like you.

833
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:46,186
It's because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

834
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:49,169
It's a complicated emotion.

835
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:52,082
- Ohh!
- Don't cry. I like you.

836
00:41:52,117 --> 00:41:56,539
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

837
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:58,496
Um... I don't remember.
Were you?

838
00:41:58,531 --> 00:42:00,370
No, no, no, no, no.
We're just-

839
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:02,174
Do you guys know
how I can get to-

840
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:04,590
Look, pal, we're talking
to the lady, not you.

841
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:06,210
Hey, hey.
You like impressions?

842
00:42:06,245 --> 00:42:08,266
Mm-hmm.

843
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,681
Just like in rehearsals,
gentlemen.

844
00:42:10,716 --> 00:42:12,226
So what are we?
Take a guess.

845
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:13,566
Oh, oh.
I've seen one of those.

846
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:15,727
I'm a fish with a nose
like a sword.

847
00:42:15,762 --> 00:42:17,817
- Wait, wait, um-
- It's a swordfish!

848
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:20,893
Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

849
00:42:20,928 --> 00:42:22,488
Where's the butter?

850
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:23,943
Ooh! It's on
the tip of my tongue!

851
00:42:23,979 --> 00:42:25,949
- Lobster.
- Saw that!

852
00:42:25,984 --> 00:42:27,864
Lots of legs!
Live in the ocean.

853
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,362
- Clam!
- Close enough!

854
00:42:29,397 --> 00:42:30,825
Oh, it's a whale
of a tale

855
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,326
I'll tell you, lad...

856
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,340
They're good.

857
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:37,126
Will somebody please
give me directions?!

858
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:39,188
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
- I'm serious!

859
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,824
Blah blah blah,
me, me, blah!

860
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,427
Blah blah blah,
me, me, me!

861
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:43,932
Thank you.

862
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:46,473
Oh, dear. Hey!
Hey, come back!

863
00:42:46,508 --> 00:42:49,183
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

864
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:51,193
While they're doing their
silly little impressions...

865
00:42:51,229 --> 00:42:55,399
I am miles from home with a fish
that can't remember her name!

866
00:42:55,434 --> 00:42:56,694
I bet that's frustrating.

867
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,190
Meanwhile,
my son is out there.

868
00:42:58,225 --> 00:43:00,205
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo?

869
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,950
But it doesn't matter
because no fish...

870
00:43:01,985 --> 00:43:03,661
in this entire ocean
is going to help me.

871
00:43:03,696 --> 00:43:07,491
Well, I'm helping you.

872
00:43:07,526 --> 00:43:08,831
Wait right here.

873
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:12,662
- Guys!
- Is he bothering you again?

874
00:43:12,698 --> 00:43:14,217
No, no. He's a good guy.

875
00:43:14,252 --> 00:43:16,468
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

876
00:43:16,503 --> 00:43:19,424
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

877
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,099
Sydney? Oh, sure!

878
00:43:22,134 --> 00:43:23,934
Ted here's got relatives
in Sydney.

879
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:25,557
- Don't you, Ted?
- Sure do!

880
00:43:25,592 --> 00:43:27,145
Oh! Hey!
They know Sydney!

881
00:43:28,316 --> 00:43:29,855
You wouldn't know how
to get there, would you?

882
00:43:29,891 --> 00:43:31,821
You want to follow the E.A.C.

883
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:34,606
That's the East
Australian Current.

884
00:43:34,642 --> 00:43:36,959
Big current.
Can't miss it.

885
00:43:36,993 --> 00:43:39,242
It's in... that direction.

886
00:43:39,278 --> 00:43:41,138
And then you follow that
for about...

887
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:42,998
I don't know.
What do you guys think?

888
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:44,172
About three leagues?

889
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:47,208
That little baby will put you
right past Sydney.

890
00:43:47,243 --> 00:43:49,709
- Ta-da!
- That's great!

891
00:43:49,744 --> 00:43:50,885
Dory, you did it!

892
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,764
Oh, please,
I'm just your little helper.

893
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,825
- Helping along. That's me.
- Fellas, thank you.

894
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,856
Don't mention it!
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?

895
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:01,311
Oh, you guys.
You really nailed him. Bye.

896
00:44:01,346 --> 00:44:03,696
Oh, hey, ma'am.
One more thing.

897
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:07,353
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

898
00:44:07,388 --> 00:44:09,273
Trench...
through it, not over it.

899
00:44:09,307 --> 00:44:12,033
I'll remember. Hey, hey!

900
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:15,668
Hey, wait up, partner!
Hold on!

901
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:18,494
Wait, wait, wait!
I gotta tell you something.

902
00:44:18,529 --> 00:44:21,169
Whoa.

903
00:44:21,205 --> 00:44:23,586
Nice trench.

904
00:44:25,256 --> 00:44:28,296
Hello!

905
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:33,158
- OK, let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench.

906
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:35,354
Come on, we'll swim over
this thing.

907
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:37,483
Whoa, partner.
Little red flag going up.

908
00:44:37,518 --> 00:44:41,189
Something's telling me
to swim through it, not over it.

909
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:42,824
Are you looking at this thing?

910
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:44,365
It's got death
written all over it.

911
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:47,204
I really, really, really
think we should swim through.

912
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,530
And I'm really, really done
talking about this. Over we go.

913
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:51,507
- Trust me on this.
- Trust you?

914
00:44:51,543 --> 00:44:53,452
Yes, trust.
It's what friends do.

915
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:55,336
Look! Something shiny!

916
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:57,161
- Where?
- It just swam over the trench.

917
00:44:57,196 --> 00:45:01,394
- Come on, we'll follow it!
- OK!

918
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:05,557
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

919
00:45:05,592 --> 00:45:09,093
Exactly. And look at that-
there's the current.

920
00:45:09,128 --> 00:45:11,724
We should be there in no time.

921
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:13,529
Hey, little guy.

922
00:45:13,564 --> 00:45:15,319
You wanted to go
through the trench.

923
00:45:15,354 --> 00:45:17,480
I shall call him Squishy,
and he shall be mine.

924
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:19,606
And he shall be my Squishy.
Come here, Squishy.

925
00:45:19,696 --> 00:45:21,156
Come here, little Squishy.

926
00:45:22,946 --> 00:45:24,161
Ow!

927
00:45:24,196 --> 00:45:27,117
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy!

928
00:45:27,152 --> 00:45:28,922
Shoo, shoo! Get away!

929
00:45:28,956 --> 00:45:31,312
- Let me see that.
- Don't touch it.

930
00:45:31,347 --> 00:45:33,528
I won't touch it.
I just want to look.

931
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,708
Hey! How come
it didn't sting you?

932
00:45:35,743 --> 00:45:37,377
It did.
It's just that-

933
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:38,960
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Hold still.

934
00:45:38,995 --> 00:45:40,475
I live in this anemone...

935
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,430
and I'm used
to these kind of stings.

936
00:45:42,464 --> 00:45:43,605
Ow! Ow! Ow!

937
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,640
It doesn't look bad.
You'll be fine.

938
00:45:45,675 --> 00:45:47,396
But now we know, don't we...

939
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:49,606
that we don't want
to touch these again.

940
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,732
Let's be thankful this time
it was just a little one.

941
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,624
- Aah!
- Aah!

942
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:56,482
Don't move.

943
00:45:58,283 --> 00:46:01,203
- This is bad, Dory.
- Hey, watch this!

944
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:02,914
Boing! Boing!

945
00:46:02,948 --> 00:46:04,129
Dory!

946
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:06,500
You can't catch me

947
00:46:06,535 --> 00:46:08,873
Don't bounce on the tops!

948
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:11,180
They will... not sting you!

949
00:46:11,214 --> 00:46:13,926
- The tops don't sting you!
- Two in a row! Beat that!

950
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,885
Dory, listen to me.
I have an idea-a game.

951
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,385
- A game?
- Yes.

952
00:46:18,466 --> 00:46:21,141
- I love games! Pick me!
- Here's the game.

953
00:46:21,176 --> 00:46:24,688
Whoever can hop the fastest
out of these jellyfish wins!

954
00:46:24,722 --> 00:46:26,323
- OK.
- Rules, rules, rules!

955
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:28,938
You can't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.

956
00:46:28,973 --> 00:46:30,823
Something about tentacles.
Got it. Go!

957
00:46:30,858 --> 00:46:33,819
Wait! Not something about 'em,
it's all about 'em!

958
00:46:33,854 --> 00:46:34,994
- Whee!
- Wait, Dory!

959
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,199
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

960
00:46:37,234 --> 00:46:38,335
Whoa! Dory!

961
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,334
Boing, boing, boing!

962
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:43,291
Wait a minute! Whoa! Dory!

963
00:46:43,326 --> 00:46:44,836
Whee!

964
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:48,171
We're cheating death now.
That's what we're doing.

965
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:49,881
But we're having fun
at the same time.

966
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:51,307
I can do this.
Just be careful.

967
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,262
Yeah, careful I don't
make you cry when I win!

968
00:46:53,298 --> 00:46:54,473
I don't think so!

969
00:46:54,508 --> 00:46:56,053
Ha ha ha ha!

970
00:46:56,088 --> 00:46:57,859
Whoa!

971
00:46:57,893 --> 00:46:59,029
Give it up, old man.

972
00:46:59,064 --> 00:47:01,394
You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

973
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,394
The question is, Dory,
are you hungry?

974
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:04,699
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

975
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:07,525
'Cause you're about
to eat my bubbles!

976
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,735
Duck to the left!
Right there!

977
00:47:12,076 --> 00:47:14,501
The clownfish is the winner!

978
00:47:14,536 --> 00:47:17,627
Whoo-hoo! We did it!
Look at us!

979
00:47:17,663 --> 00:47:19,207
Dory?

980
00:47:21,377 --> 00:47:22,837
Oh, no.

981
00:47:23,878 --> 00:47:26,218
Dory! Dory!

982
00:47:26,254 --> 00:47:28,338
Dory!

983
00:47:30,259 --> 00:47:32,559
Dory!

984
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,406
Am I disqualified?

985
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:42,026
No, you're doing fine!
You're actually winning!

986
00:47:42,061 --> 00:47:44,611
But you gotta stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

987
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:47,572
P. Sherman...
Wallaby Way, Sydney...

988
00:47:47,607 --> 00:47:49,373
That's it!

989
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,548
Uhh!

990
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:53,294
- Wallaby Way...
- Uhh! Stay awake!

991
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,624
Stay awake!
Ooh! Stay awake!

992
00:47:55,659 --> 00:47:59,424
Stay... awake!

993
00:48:01,925 --> 00:48:05,095
- Awake.
- P. Sherman.

994
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:08,266
- Awake.
-42 Wallaby Way.

995
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:12,316
Wake up. Nemo...

996
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,370
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

997
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:30,756
Yeah.

998
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:34,802
You're lucky to have someone
out there looking for you.

999
00:48:34,836 --> 00:48:37,633
He's not looking for me.

1000
00:48:37,669 --> 00:48:40,432
He's scared of the ocean.

1001
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:42,012
Peach, any movement?

1002
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,012
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's gotta be soon.

1003
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:46,563
Keep on him.

1004
00:48:48,944 --> 00:48:51,814
My first escape-
landed on dental tools.

1005
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:53,274
I was aiming for the toilet.

1006
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:54,450
Toilet?

1007
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:57,120
All drains
lead to the ocean, kid.

1008
00:48:57,155 --> 00:49:00,455
Wow. How many times have
you tried to get out?

1009
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,042
Ah, I've lost count.

1010
00:49:02,076 --> 00:49:04,036
Fish aren't meant
to be in a box, kid.

1011
00:49:04,071 --> 00:49:05,746
It does things to you.

1012
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:10,302
Potty break! He grabbed
the Reader's Digest.

1013
00:49:10,337 --> 00:49:13,758
- We have 4.2 minutes!
- That's your cue, Sharkbait.

1014
00:49:13,793 --> 00:49:16,063
- You can do it, kid.
- We gotta be quick.

1015
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:18,769
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

1016
00:49:18,804 --> 00:49:21,101
and I'll talk you
through the rest.

1017
00:49:21,137 --> 00:49:23,399
- OK.
- It'll be a piece of kelp.

1018
00:49:31,821 --> 00:49:33,166
Nicely done!

1019
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:34,993
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!

1020
00:49:35,027 --> 00:49:37,541
Here comes the pebble.

1021
00:49:38,752 --> 00:49:40,003
Ptoo.

1022
00:49:42,423 --> 00:49:45,254
Now, do you see
a small opening?

1023
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:46,679
Uh-huh!

1024
00:49:46,714 --> 00:49:49,889
Inside it,
you'll see a rotating fan.

1025
00:49:49,924 --> 00:49:54,515
Wedge that pebble into the fan
to stop it turning.

1026
00:49:57,896 --> 00:49:59,191
Aah!

1027
00:49:59,226 --> 00:50:01,567
- Careful, Sharkbait!
- I can't do it!

1028
00:50:01,602 --> 00:50:03,254
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

1029
00:50:03,289 --> 00:50:04,907
He'll be fine. Try again!

1030
00:50:04,942 --> 00:50:07,622
OK.

1031
00:50:07,658 --> 00:50:10,158
That's it, Sharkbait.

1032
00:50:10,193 --> 00:50:12,499
Nice and steady.

1033
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,505
I got it! I got it!

1034
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,045
- He did it!
- That's great, kid!

1035
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,551
Now swim up the tube
and out.

1036
00:50:38,774 --> 00:50:41,539
Oh, no! Gill!

1037
00:50:41,574 --> 00:50:42,785
- Sharkbait!
- Oh, my gosh!

1038
00:50:42,819 --> 00:50:44,040
Get him outta there!

1039
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:46,581
- What do we do?
- Oh, no!

1040
00:50:46,615 --> 00:50:48,665
Stay calm, kid.
Just don't panic!

1041
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,050
Help me!

1042
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:53,507
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!

1043
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:59,447
- No! No! No!
- Feed me more!

1044
00:50:59,483 --> 00:51:01,928
- That's it!
- Sharkbait! Grab it!

1045
00:51:01,963 --> 00:51:04,220
I got it!

1046
00:51:04,256 --> 00:51:06,478
Pull!

1047
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,860
Gill, don't make him
go back in there.

1048
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:21,161
No. We're done.

1049
00:51:34,173 --> 00:51:35,849
Dude.

1050
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,704
- Uhh.
- Dude.

1051
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:43,525
Focus, dude. Dude.

1052
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,150
Ohh.

1053
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,711
Oh, he lives.
Hey, dude!

1054
00:51:47,746 --> 00:51:50,056
Ohh. What happened?

1055
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:52,332
Saw the whole thing, dude.

1056
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:54,137
First, you were all,
like, Whoa!...

1057
00:51:54,173 --> 00:51:55,907
and then we were
all, like, Whoa!...

1058
00:51:55,942 --> 00:51:57,833
and then you were,
like, Whoa.

1059
00:51:57,868 --> 00:52:00,327
What are you talking about?

1060
00:52:00,363 --> 00:52:03,016
You, mini-man.
Takin' on the jellies.

1061
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:05,669
You got serious
thrill issues, dude.

1062
00:52:05,704 --> 00:52:06,934
- Ohh.
- Awesome.

1063
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:10,186
Uhh. Oh, my stomach. Ohh!

1064
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:12,220
Oh, man. No hurlin'
on the shell, dude, OK?

1065
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:13,988
Just waxed it.

1066
00:52:14,023 --> 00:52:15,687
So, Mr. Turtle-

1067
00:52:15,722 --> 00:52:18,101
Whoa, dude.
Mr. Turtle is my father.

1068
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:20,039
The name's Crush.

1069
00:52:20,074 --> 00:52:21,907
Crush? Really?

1070
00:52:21,942 --> 00:52:26,654
OK, Crush. I need to
the East Australian Current.

1071
00:52:26,689 --> 00:52:28,296
E.A.C.?

1072
00:52:28,331 --> 00:52:29,869
Oh, dude.

1073
00:52:29,903 --> 00:52:32,284
You're ridin' it, dude!

1074
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,955
Check it out!

1075
00:52:55,859 --> 00:52:57,778
OK, grab shell, dude!

1076
00:52:57,813 --> 00:53:00,109
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

1077
00:53:08,911 --> 00:53:11,621
Ha ha! Righteous!
Righteous!

1078
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:16,382
- Yeah!
- Stop!

1079
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:18,808
So...

1080
00:53:18,843 --> 00:53:22,433
What brings you on this fine day
to the E.A.C.?

1081
00:53:22,468 --> 00:53:25,053
Dory and I need
to get to Sydney.

1082
00:53:25,088 --> 00:53:27,117
Dory!
Is she all right?

1083
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:29,144
Huh? Oh, little blue.

1084
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:31,855
She is sub-level, dude.

1085
00:53:35,986 --> 00:53:38,576
Dory! Dory! Dory!

1086
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:40,326
Dory.

1087
00:53:42,037 --> 00:53:44,882
I'm so sorry.

1088
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:48,253
This is all my fault.
It's my fault.

1089
00:53:48,288 --> 00:53:53,300
Twenty-nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here I come!

1090
00:53:53,334 --> 00:53:55,339
There you are!

1091
00:53:56,549 --> 00:53:59,469
Catch me if you can!

1092
00:53:59,505 --> 00:54:01,815
Dory?

1093
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:03,730
Nice wave!

1094
00:54:03,765 --> 00:54:05,643
Oh, wow!

1095
00:54:05,678 --> 00:54:06,830
Heh heh.

1096
00:54:06,864 --> 00:54:09,327
Up you go!

1097
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:12,403
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

1098
00:54:12,438 --> 00:54:13,903
Whoa! Whoa!

1099
00:54:15,163 --> 00:54:17,533
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

1100
00:54:19,374 --> 00:54:22,399
- Oh, my goodness!
- Kill the motor, dude.

1101
00:54:22,435 --> 00:54:25,425
Let us see what Squirt does
flying solo.

1102
00:54:31,096 --> 00:54:33,811
Whoa!

1103
00:54:33,846 --> 00:54:36,861
Whoa! That was so cool!

1104
00:54:36,897 --> 00:54:38,693
Hey, Dad,
did you see that?

1105
00:54:38,728 --> 00:54:41,108
Did you see me?
Did you see what I did?

1106
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:44,108
You so totally rock, Squirt!

1107
00:54:44,143 --> 00:54:45,649
So give me some fin.

1108
00:54:45,684 --> 00:54:47,034
Noggin.

1109
00:54:47,069 --> 00:54:48,489
- Dude.
- Dude.

1110
00:54:48,524 --> 00:54:49,874
Oh... intro.

1111
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,929
Jellyman, offspring.

1112
00:54:51,964 --> 00:54:53,915
Offspring, Jellyman.

1113
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:57,506
- Jellies?! Sweet.
- Totally.

1114
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:00,791
Apparently, I must've done
something you liked... dudes.

1115
00:55:00,826 --> 00:55:03,217
- You rock, dude!
- Ow.

1116
00:55:03,252 --> 00:55:08,053
Curl away, my son.
It's awesome, Jellyman.

1117
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:09,819
The little dudes
are just eggs.

1118
00:55:09,855 --> 00:55:11,553
We leave 'em
on a beach to hatch...

1119
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:12,819
and then, coo-coo-cachoo...

1120
00:55:12,854 --> 00:55:15,313
they find their way back
to the big ol' blue.

1121
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:17,609
- All by themselves?
- Yeah.

1122
00:55:17,644 --> 00:55:20,695
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

1123
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:21,910
Well, you never really know.

1124
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:25,406
But when they know,
you'll know, you know? Ha.

1125
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,042
Hey, look, everybody.

1126
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,797
I know that dude!
It's the Jellyman!

1127
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,842
Go on. Jump on him!

1128
00:55:35,877 --> 00:55:38,547
- Turtle pile!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1129
00:55:38,582 --> 00:55:40,940
- Are you funny?
- Where's your shell?

1130
00:55:40,976 --> 00:55:42,992
- I need to breathe!
- Are you running away?

1131
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:45,009
Did you really cross
the jellyfish forest?

1132
00:55:45,045 --> 00:55:47,020
- Did they sting you?
- One at a time!

1133
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:48,695
Mr. Fish, did you die?

1134
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:51,311
Sorry, I was
a little vague on the details.

1135
00:55:51,346 --> 00:55:52,873
So, where are you going?

1136
00:55:52,907 --> 00:55:55,094
You see, my son was taken.

1137
00:55:55,129 --> 00:55:57,282
My son was taken away from me.

1138
00:55:57,316 --> 00:55:59,537
- No way.
- What happened?

1139
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:01,782
No, no, kids.
I don't want to talk about it.

1140
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,163
Aww! Please?

1141
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:06,245
Please?

1142
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,219
Well, OK.

1143
00:56:08,254 --> 00:56:12,134
I live on this reef
a long, long way from here.

1144
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:14,175
This is gonna be good.
I can tell.

1145
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,422
And my son Nemo...

1146
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:18,601
See, he was mad at me.

1147
00:56:18,636 --> 00:56:20,241
And maybe he wouldn't
have done it...

1148
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:21,846
if I hadn't been
so tough on him.

1149
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:23,062
I don't know.

1150
00:56:23,096 --> 00:56:25,582
Anyway, he swam out in
the open water to this boat...

1151
00:56:25,617 --> 00:56:28,157
and when he was out there,
these divers appeared...

1152
00:56:28,192 --> 00:56:30,697
and I tried to stop them,
but the boat was too fast.

1153
00:56:30,732 --> 00:56:32,800
So, we swam out in the ocean
to follow them...

1154
00:56:32,835 --> 00:56:35,267
They couldn't stop 'em.
And then Nemo's dad...

1155
00:56:35,302 --> 00:56:37,698
he swims out to the ocean,
and they bump into...

1156
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:39,004
...three ferocious sharks.

1157
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:41,160
He scares away the sharks
by blowing 'em up!

1158
00:56:41,195 --> 00:56:42,505
Golly, that's amazing.

1159
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:44,250
And then dives
thousands of feet...

1160
00:56:44,285 --> 00:56:45,872
...straight down
into the dark.

1161
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:47,426
It's wicked dark down there.

1162
00:56:47,461 --> 00:56:49,171
You can't see a thing.
How's it going, Bob?

1163
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,846
And the only thing
they can see down there...

1164
00:56:50,881 --> 00:56:52,681
...is the light from
this big, horrible creature...

1165
00:56:52,716 --> 00:56:54,682
with razor-sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.

1166
00:56:54,717 --> 00:56:56,220
And then he has
to blast his way...

1167
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:57,688
So, these two little fish
have been...

1168
00:56:57,722 --> 00:57:01,313
searching the ocean for days
on the East Australian Current.

1169
00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:03,653
Which means that he may be
on his way here right now.

1170
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:05,199
That should put him
in Sydney Harbor...

1171
00:57:05,234 --> 00:57:06,565
...in a matter of days.
I mean, it sounds like...

1172
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:08,539
this guy is gonna
stop at nothing...

1173
00:57:08,574 --> 00:57:11,405
...till he finds his son.
I sure hope he makes it.

1174
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,415
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

1175
00:57:19,996 --> 00:57:21,932
Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1176
00:57:21,967 --> 00:57:27,058
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1177
00:57:29,093 --> 00:57:31,536
Would you just shut up?!

1178
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:33,944
You're rats with wings!

1179
00:57:33,979 --> 00:57:35,940
Bloke's been looking
for his boy Nemo.

1180
00:57:35,974 --> 00:57:38,458
- Nemo?!
- He was taken off the reef...

1181
00:57:38,492 --> 00:57:41,137
- Take it! You happy?
- Mine! Mine! Mine!

1182
00:57:41,172 --> 00:57:43,781
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.

1183
00:57:43,816 --> 00:57:44,992
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1184
00:57:45,027 --> 00:57:46,384
Whoooa...

1185
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:47,875
Hyah!

1186
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:49,297
Mine?

1187
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,622
Last I heard, he's heading
towards the harbor.

1188
00:57:51,657 --> 00:57:54,083
Ho ho! Brilliant!

1189
00:58:06,935 --> 00:58:08,940
Is he doing OK?

1190
00:58:08,975 --> 00:58:12,061
Whatever you do,
Don't mention D-a-r-

1191
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,146
It's OK. I know who
you're talking about.

1192
00:58:23,118 --> 00:58:24,498
Gill?

1193
00:58:26,919 --> 00:58:28,634
Gill?

1194
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:31,344
Hey, Sharkbait.

1195
00:58:31,379 --> 00:58:33,635
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the-

1196
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:35,841
No, I'm the one
who should be sorry.

1197
00:58:35,876 --> 00:58:38,613
I was so ready
to get out...

1198
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:41,317
so ready to taste that ocean...

1199
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:44,811
I was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

1200
00:58:44,847 --> 00:58:48,778
Nothing should be worth that.

1201
00:58:48,813 --> 00:58:52,073
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

1202
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:58,705
All right.
Hey, hey, hey-

1203
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,339
- What the-
- Aaah!

1204
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:04,125
That's one way to pull a tooth.

1205
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,221
Huh. Darn kids.

1206
00:59:06,256 --> 00:59:09,297
Good thing I pulled the
right one, eh, Prime Minister?

1207
00:59:09,331 --> 00:59:10,852
Hey, psst!

1208
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:13,243
Oh, Nigel!
You just missed an extraction.

1209
00:59:13,278 --> 00:59:15,598
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

1210
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:17,728
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

1211
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:19,999
- I've got to speak with him.
- What is it?

1212
00:59:20,034 --> 00:59:22,228
Your dad's been fighting
the entire ocean...

1213
00:59:22,263 --> 00:59:24,864
- looking for you.
- My father? Really?

1214
00:59:24,899 --> 00:59:29,070
He's traveled hundreds of miles,
battling sharks and jellyfish-

1215
00:59:29,105 --> 00:59:31,535
Sharks? That can't be him.

1216
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:34,240
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.

1217
00:59:34,276 --> 00:59:36,376
- Tuna? Trout?
- Marlin?

1218
00:59:36,412 --> 00:59:38,291
Marlin! The little clownfish
from the reef.

1219
00:59:38,327 --> 00:59:40,922
It's my dad!
He took on a shark!

1220
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:43,258
I heard he took on three.

1221
00:59:43,293 --> 00:59:46,138
- Three sharks?
- That's 4,800 teeth!

1222
00:59:46,173 --> 00:59:48,303
After you were taken
by Diver Dan over there...

1223
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:50,594
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

1224
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:51,940
Really?

1225
00:59:51,975 --> 00:59:53,769
He's swimming,
giving it all he's got...

1226
00:59:53,804 --> 00:59:55,900
and then three gigantic
sharks capture him...

1227
00:59:55,935 --> 00:59:58,226
and he blows them up
and dives thousands of feet...

1228
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,071
and gets chased by a monster
with huge teeth!

1229
01:00:01,106 --> 01:00:03,777
He ties this demon to a rock,
and what's his reward?

1230
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:06,122
He gets to battle
an entire jellyfish forest!

1231
01:00:06,156 --> 01:00:09,373
Now he's with a bunch of
sea turtles on the E.A.C...

1232
01:00:09,408 --> 01:00:12,917
and the word is he's headed
this way right now... to Sydney!

1233
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:14,293
- Wow!
- What a good daddy!

1234
01:00:14,328 --> 01:00:16,958
He was looking for you
after all, Sharkbait.

1235
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,030
He's swimming to the filter!

1236
01:00:22,065 --> 01:00:23,640
- Sharkbait!
- Not again!

1237
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:28,100
Sharkbait!

1238
01:00:28,135 --> 01:00:29,436
No!

1239
01:00:29,471 --> 01:00:31,332
You got your whole life
ahead of you!

1240
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:33,191
- We'll help you, kid!
- Get him out!

1241
01:00:37,442 --> 01:00:39,117
Get him out of there!

1242
01:00:39,152 --> 01:00:40,823
Come on, kid!
Grab the end!

1243
01:00:40,858 --> 01:00:43,418
Sharkbait!

1244
01:00:43,453 --> 01:00:45,244
- No!
- Can you hear me?

1245
01:00:45,279 --> 01:00:47,201
Nemo! Can you hear me?

1246
01:00:47,236 --> 01:00:49,161
Yeah, I can hear you.

1247
01:00:49,196 --> 01:00:51,050
Sharkbait, you did it!

1248
01:00:51,085 --> 01:00:54,925
Sharkbait, you're...
covered with germs! Aah!

1249
01:00:54,961 --> 01:00:56,971
Ha ha!
That took guts, kid.

1250
01:00:57,006 --> 01:00:59,507
All right, gang,
we have less than 48 hours...

1251
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:00,812
before Darla gets here.

1252
01:01:00,846 --> 01:01:03,162
This tank'll get
plenty dirty in that time...

1253
01:01:03,197 --> 01:01:05,479
but we have to help it along
any way we can.

1254
01:01:05,513 --> 01:01:07,995
- Jacques? No cleaning.
- I shall resist.

1255
01:01:08,029 --> 01:01:10,479
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

1256
01:01:10,514 --> 01:01:11,694
Think dirty thoughts.

1257
01:01:11,729 --> 01:01:13,989
We're gonna make
this tank so filthy...

1258
01:01:14,024 --> 01:01:16,530
the dentist
will have to clean it.

1259
01:01:16,565 --> 01:01:18,700
- Good work!
- Ha ha ha!

1260
01:01:25,211 --> 01:01:27,717
All right, we're here, dudes!

1261
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:31,002
Get ready!
Your exit's coming up, man!

1262
01:01:31,038 --> 01:01:32,518
Where? I don't see it!

1263
01:01:32,552 --> 01:01:34,978
Right there!
I see it! I see it!

1264
01:01:35,013 --> 01:01:37,764
The swirling vortex of terror?

1265
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:40,514
- That's it, dude.
- Of course it is.

1266
01:01:40,548 --> 01:01:44,564
OK, first,
find your exit buddy.

1267
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:47,105
Do you have your exit buddy?

1268
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,370
Yes!

1269
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:53,156
Squirt give you a rundown
of proper exiting technique.

1270
01:01:53,191 --> 01:01:56,824
Good afternoon!
We'll have a great jump today!

1271
01:01:56,859 --> 01:02:00,159
OK, crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1272
01:02:00,193 --> 01:02:03,458
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out!

1273
01:02:03,494 --> 01:02:06,711
Remember-
rip it, roll it, and punch it!

1274
01:02:06,745 --> 01:02:09,894
He's trying to speak to me,
I know it!

1275
01:02:09,929 --> 01:02:13,180
You're really cute, but I don't
know what you're saying!

1276
01:02:13,215 --> 01:02:15,137
Say the first thing again.

1277
01:02:15,172 --> 01:02:17,061
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

1278
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:25,112
- Whoa!
- Wahoo!

1279
01:02:25,147 --> 01:02:27,953
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1280
01:02:29,953 --> 01:02:31,338
Whoo!

1281
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,959
That was... fun!

1282
01:02:33,993 --> 01:02:36,295
I actually enjoyed that.

1283
01:02:36,329 --> 01:02:37,930
Hey, look, turtles!

1284
01:02:37,965 --> 01:02:40,930
Ha ha!
Most excellent!

1285
01:02:40,964 --> 01:02:43,466
Now turn your
fishy tails around...

1286
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,966
and swim straight on
through to Sydney!

1287
01:02:46,002 --> 01:02:48,141
No worries, man!

1288
01:02:48,176 --> 01:02:50,307
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!

1289
01:02:50,342 --> 01:02:52,862
- Bye!
- Bye, Jellyman!

1290
01:02:52,897 --> 01:02:55,227
You tell your little dude
I said hi, OK?

1291
01:02:55,262 --> 01:02:56,437
See ya later, dudes!

1292
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:58,153
Bye, everyone!

1293
01:02:58,189 --> 01:03:01,069
Nemo would have loved this.

1294
01:03:01,104 --> 01:03:03,950
Ooh! Hey! Crush, I forgot!

1295
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:05,504
How old are you?

1296
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:09,690
150, dude!
And still young! Rock on!

1297
01:03:09,725 --> 01:03:13,841
150! 150!
I gotta remember that.

1298
01:03:13,876 --> 01:03:15,091
Whoa.

1299
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:22,477
- We going in there?
- Yep.

1300
01:03:22,513 --> 01:03:26,413
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1301
01:03:26,448 --> 01:03:29,776
Yep. We're gonna
just swim straight.

1302
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:33,105
Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming

1303
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:34,315
Dory...

1304
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:45,247
Boy, this is taking awhile.

1305
01:03:45,282 --> 01:03:47,458
How about we play a game?

1306
01:03:47,492 --> 01:03:48,722
OK.

1307
01:03:48,756 --> 01:03:51,878
OK, I'm thinking
of something orange...

1308
01:03:51,914 --> 01:03:53,816
and it's small-

1309
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:56,599
- It's me.
- Right!

1310
01:03:56,634 --> 01:03:59,349
It's orange and small-

1311
01:03:59,384 --> 01:04:00,644
It's me.

1312
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:02,565
All righty,
Mr. Smartypants.

1313
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,811
And it's orange and small
and white stripes-

1314
01:04:05,846 --> 01:04:08,248
Me. And the next one,
just a guess, me.

1315
01:04:08,283 --> 01:04:10,616
- That's just scary.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1316
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:12,532
I have definitely seen
this floating speck before.

1317
01:04:12,567 --> 01:04:14,029
That means
we've passed it before...

1318
01:04:14,064 --> 01:04:15,574
and that means
we're going in circles...

1319
01:04:15,608 --> 01:04:17,082
and that means
we're not going straight!

1320
01:04:17,162 --> 01:04:19,258
- Hey, hey!
- Get to the surface.

1321
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:20,913
We'll figure it out
up there. Let's go!

1322
01:04:20,948 --> 01:04:23,371
- Hey! Relax.
- What?

1323
01:04:23,406 --> 01:04:25,794
Take a deep breath.

1324
01:04:27,715 --> 01:04:29,905
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1325
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,060
Fine. Who do you
want to ask, the speck?

1326
01:04:32,095 --> 01:04:34,481
- There's nobody here!
- There has to be someone.

1327
01:04:34,516 --> 01:04:37,436
It's the ocean, silly.
We're not the only two in here.

1328
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:39,767
Let's see.
OK, no one there.

1329
01:04:39,802 --> 01:04:44,278
Nope. Nada.

1330
01:04:45,658 --> 01:04:47,453
There's somebody.
Hey! Excuse-

1331
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:49,334
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it's my turn.

1332
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:50,954
I'm thinking of something
dark and mysterious.

1333
01:04:50,989 --> 01:04:53,409
It's a fish we don't know.
If we ask it directions...

1334
01:04:53,444 --> 01:04:55,721
it could ingest us
and spit out our bones!

1335
01:04:55,756 --> 01:04:57,773
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

1336
01:04:57,809 --> 01:04:59,790
I don't want to play
the gender card right now.

1337
01:04:59,825 --> 01:05:01,766
Let's play
the Let's Not Die card.

1338
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:04,406
- You want to get out of here?
- Of course I do.

1339
01:05:04,441 --> 01:05:07,011
How are we gonna do that
unless we give it a shot?

1340
01:05:07,046 --> 01:05:09,052
Dory, you don't
fully understand-

1341
01:05:09,087 --> 01:05:11,102
Come on. Trust me on this.

1342
01:05:19,154 --> 01:05:22,950
All right.

1343
01:05:22,984 --> 01:05:26,286
Excuse me! Whoo-hoo!
Little fella?

1344
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:30,245
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1345
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:32,301
Ha. Hello.

1346
01:05:32,336 --> 01:05:33,842
- His son Bingo-
- Nemo.

1347
01:05:33,877 --> 01:05:36,931
- Nemo was taken to-
- Sydney.

1348
01:05:36,967 --> 01:05:40,178
Sydney! And it's
really, really important...

1349
01:05:40,213 --> 01:05:42,178
that we get there
as fast as we can...

1350
01:05:42,213 --> 01:05:44,274
so can you help us out?

1351
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:47,849
Come on, little fella.
Come on.

1352
01:05:47,883 --> 01:05:51,115
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1353
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:54,690
I don't think
that's a little fella.

1354
01:05:54,725 --> 01:05:57,898
Oh! Big fella.
Whale. OK.

1355
01:05:57,933 --> 01:06:01,072
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1356
01:06:01,107 --> 01:06:04,337
Mooo! Weee neeed...

1357
01:06:04,371 --> 01:06:08,468
- Dory?
- Tooo fiind his son.

1358
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:11,213
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

1359
01:06:11,248 --> 01:06:14,130
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1360
01:06:14,165 --> 01:06:17,406
Dory! Heaven knows
what you're saying!

1361
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:20,189
- See, he's swimming away.
- Cooome baaack.

1362
01:06:20,223 --> 01:06:22,936
He's not coming back.
You offended him.

1363
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:25,183
Maybe a different dialect.

1364
01:06:25,218 --> 01:06:27,362
- Moooohhhmmooo...
- Dory!

1365
01:06:27,396 --> 01:06:30,737
This is not whale.
You're speaking upset stomach.

1366
01:06:30,771 --> 01:06:32,947
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.

1367
01:06:32,982 --> 01:06:34,412
Wooooooo...

1368
01:06:34,447 --> 01:06:37,448
- You actually sound sick.
- Maybe louder?

1369
01:06:37,483 --> 01:06:38,923
- Rah! Rah!
- Don't do that!

1370
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:40,749
Too much orca.
Didn't it sound orca-ish?

1371
01:06:40,784 --> 01:06:42,044
It doesn't sound orca.

1372
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:43,919
It sounds like nothing
I've ever heard.

1373
01:06:43,954 --> 01:06:46,425
- Oooooo!
- Ohh!

1374
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,385
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1375
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,471
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1376
01:06:51,506 --> 01:06:55,051
Swim away!
- Oh, look, krill!

1377
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:02,102
- Aah!
- Aah!

1378
01:07:05,983 --> 01:07:08,783
Look at that.
Would you look at that?

1379
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:12,750
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1380
01:07:12,785 --> 01:07:15,835
All thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1381
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:17,915
Jacques,
I said no cleaning.

1382
01:07:17,956 --> 01:07:20,126
I am ashamed.

1383
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,297
Look! Scum angel!

1384
01:07:24,467 --> 01:07:26,432
Ooh! Aaah!

1385
01:07:26,467 --> 01:07:28,426
Bubbles!
I love the bubbles!

1386
01:07:30,478 --> 01:07:34,148
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?

1387
01:07:34,184 --> 01:07:36,774
9:00 and cue dentist.

1388
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,314
Hello, Barbara.
Sorry I'm late.

1389
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:41,820
OK, here we go.
Here we go, OK.

1390
01:07:41,855 --> 01:07:43,575
Little Davey Reynolds...

1391
01:07:43,611 --> 01:07:45,241
Walks to the counter,
drops the keys...

1392
01:07:45,276 --> 01:07:47,363
Bloat, that's disgusting!

1393
01:07:47,398 --> 01:07:49,451
Tastes pretty good to me.

1394
01:07:49,487 --> 01:07:51,217
- Urrrp!
- Eww!

1395
01:07:51,251 --> 01:07:54,172
Don't you people realize
we are swimming in our own-

1396
01:07:54,206 --> 01:07:55,292
Shh! Here he comes!

1397
01:07:55,327 --> 01:07:57,257
Aah!

1398
01:07:57,292 --> 01:08:00,633
Crikey. What a state.

1399
01:08:02,053 --> 01:08:06,225
Ohh. Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

1400
01:08:06,259 --> 01:08:09,150
-10:00, luv.
- Leave it open, would you?

1401
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:11,565
I've gotta clean the fish tank
before Darla gets here.

1402
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,660
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

1403
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:17,446
Yay!
He's gonna clean the tank!

1404
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:19,201
We're gonna be clean!

1405
01:08:19,236 --> 01:08:21,072
You ready to see your dad, kid?

1406
01:08:21,107 --> 01:08:22,872
- Uh-huh.
- Of course you are.

1407
01:08:22,908 --> 01:08:24,558
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's out there...

1408
01:08:24,593 --> 01:08:28,878
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1409
01:08:28,914 --> 01:08:31,249
Yeah.

1410
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,306
Aaah!

1411
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:37,330
Oof!

1412
01:09:42,462 --> 01:09:44,362
Whoo!

1413
01:09:44,398 --> 01:09:46,228
Yaahhh!

1414
01:09:46,263 --> 01:09:47,978
Here comes the big one.

1415
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:50,559
Ooh! Come on!
You gotta try this!

1416
01:09:50,593 --> 01:09:53,894
- Will you just stop it?
- Why? What's wrong?

1417
01:09:53,929 --> 01:09:56,224
We're in a whale,
don't you get it?

1418
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,399
- Whale?
- A whale!

1419
01:09:57,434 --> 01:10:00,195
You had to ask for help!
And now we're stuck here!

1420
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,951
Wow, a whale.
I speak whale.

1421
01:10:02,986 --> 01:10:05,801
No, you're insane!
You can't speak whale!

1422
01:10:05,836 --> 01:10:09,937
I have to get out!
I have to find my son!

1423
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:14,037
I have to tell him
how old sea turtles are!

1424
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:19,259
Ohhh!

1425
01:10:20,629 --> 01:10:23,300
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1426
01:10:25,009 --> 01:10:27,595
Hey...

1427
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:30,181
you OK?

1428
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:39,282
There, there.
It's all right.

1429
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:41,208
It'll be OK.

1430
01:10:41,243 --> 01:10:43,458
No. No, it won't.

1431
01:10:43,493 --> 01:10:45,748
Sure it will. You'll see.

1432
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:50,965
No. I promised him I'd never
let anything happen to him.

1433
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,385
Huh. That's a funny thing
to promise.

1434
01:10:55,419 --> 01:10:56,760
What?

1435
01:10:56,795 --> 01:10:59,265
You can't never let
anything happen to him.

1436
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:01,727
Then nothing
would ever happen to him.

1437
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:07,517
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1438
01:11:16,368 --> 01:11:18,474
- Hmm.
- What's going on?

1439
01:11:18,509 --> 01:11:20,580
Don't know. I'll ask him.

1440
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:28,131
- Dory...
- Whaaat's goooing onnn?

1441
01:11:35,132 --> 01:11:36,727
I think he says we've stopped.

1442
01:11:36,762 --> 01:11:40,063
Of course we've stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.

1443
01:11:40,098 --> 01:11:42,894
You'll make things worse.
What is that noise?

1444
01:11:46,984 --> 01:11:49,790
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1445
01:11:49,825 --> 01:11:54,826
The water's going down.
It's going down!

1446
01:11:58,497 --> 01:12:00,291
Really? You sure about that?

1447
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:02,088
Look!
Already it's half empty!

1448
01:12:02,123 --> 01:12:03,750
I'd say it's half full.

1449
01:12:03,785 --> 01:12:05,377
Stop that! It's half empty!

1450
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:11,604
OK, that one
was a little tougher.

1451
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,600
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1452
01:12:14,634 --> 01:12:16,735
or he wants a root beer float.

1453
01:12:16,769 --> 01:12:18,440
Of course he wants us
to go there!

1454
01:12:18,475 --> 01:12:20,405
That's eating us!

1455
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,406
How do I taste, Moby?
Do I taste good?

1456
01:12:23,441 --> 01:12:25,742
Tell him I'm not interested
in being lunch!

1457
01:12:25,777 --> 01:12:28,242
- OK. Heee-
- Stop talking to him!

1458
01:12:31,493 --> 01:12:33,538
- Aah!
- Aah!

1459
01:12:33,573 --> 01:12:35,748
What is going on?

1460
01:12:35,783 --> 01:12:37,888
I'll check. Whaaat-

1461
01:12:37,924 --> 01:12:40,714
No more whale!
You can't speak whale!

1462
01:12:40,749 --> 01:12:43,060
- Yes, I can!
- No, you can't!

1463
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:46,675
You think you can do these
things, but you can't, Nemo!

1464
01:12:51,646 --> 01:12:54,527
- OK.
- Dory! Oof!

1465
01:12:57,068 --> 01:13:00,663
He says it's time to let go.

1466
01:13:00,697 --> 01:13:02,698
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1467
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:04,373
How do you know?

1468
01:13:04,409 --> 01:13:07,539
How do you know something bad
isn't gonna happen?

1469
01:13:07,574 --> 01:13:09,500
I don't!

1470
01:13:21,682 --> 01:13:27,683
- Aah!
- Aah!

1471
01:13:30,063 --> 01:13:34,864
Ha ha ha!
We're alive!

1472
01:13:35,904 --> 01:13:38,595
Look! Sy-d-ney-Sydney!

1473
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:41,285
Sydney! Sydney again!

1474
01:13:43,245 --> 01:13:45,746
You were right, Dory!
We made it!

1475
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:48,756
We're gonna find my son!

1476
01:13:51,257 --> 01:13:54,762
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1477
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:57,274
Wow. I wish
I could speak whale.

1478
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:59,638
All we gotta do is find
the boat that took him.

1479
01:13:59,673 --> 01:14:02,769
- Right!
- We can do this!

1480
01:14:16,372 --> 01:14:18,667
Morning.

1481
01:14:18,702 --> 01:14:21,457
It's morning, everyone!
Today's the day!

1482
01:14:21,492 --> 01:14:24,398
The sun is shining,
the tank is clean...

1483
01:14:24,433 --> 01:14:27,304
and we are getting out-
The tank is clean.

1484
01:14:27,339 --> 01:14:29,924
The tank is clean!

1485
01:14:29,959 --> 01:14:31,519
But how?

1486
01:14:31,555 --> 01:14:34,661
Boss must've installed it
while we were sleeping.

1487
01:14:34,695 --> 01:14:37,766
- What are we gonna do?
- What's it say, Peach?

1488
01:14:39,105 --> 01:14:40,451
I can't hear you, Peach.

1489
01:14:40,486 --> 01:14:42,986
The Aquascum 2003 is
an all-purpose, self-cleaning...

1490
01:14:43,022 --> 01:14:44,911
maintenance-free,
salt water purifier...

1491
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:47,987
that is guaranteed to extend
the life of your aquarium fish.

1492
01:14:48,023 --> 01:14:49,253
Stop it!

1493
01:14:49,288 --> 01:14:50,753
The Aquascum
is programmed to scan...

1494
01:14:50,788 --> 01:14:53,118
your tank environment
every five minutes?!

1495
01:14:53,153 --> 01:14:54,869
Scan? What does that mean?

1496
01:14:56,459 --> 01:14:58,339
Aah!

1497
01:14:59,709 --> 01:15:01,299
Temperature-82 degrees...

1498
01:15:01,334 --> 01:15:03,010
PH balance-normal.

1499
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:05,435
- Ooh.
- Nice.

1500
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:10,027
Ooh-Oh!
Curse you, Aquascum!

1501
01:15:10,062 --> 01:15:12,182
That's it for the escape plan.
It's ruined.

1502
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:13,692
Then what are
we gonna do about-

1503
01:15:13,727 --> 01:15:15,657
Darla!

1504
01:15:15,692 --> 01:15:18,278
Stay down, kid!

1505
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:20,288
- False alarm.
- Whew.

1506
01:15:20,323 --> 01:15:22,459
My nerves can't take
much more of this.

1507
01:15:22,494 --> 01:15:24,743
What'll we do
when that brat gets here?

1508
01:15:24,778 --> 01:15:26,960
- I'm thinking.
- Oh! Gill!

1509
01:15:26,995 --> 01:15:30,205
- Nemo! I'm coming!
- Help me! Help me!

1510
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:34,131
Swim down! Come on, kid!

1511
01:15:34,166 --> 01:15:35,676
- Everybody jump in!
- Swim down!

1512
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:38,028
- That's it!
- What the-?

1513
01:15:38,063 --> 01:15:40,348
- Yay!
- Ha ha! Good work!

1514
01:15:40,382 --> 01:15:41,852
Gill!

1515
01:15:41,887 --> 01:15:44,433
- Nemo!
- Sharkbait!

1516
01:15:44,468 --> 01:15:46,978
- Roll, kid!
- Lean! Lean!

1517
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:53,899
Whoops.
That would've been a nasty fall.

1518
01:15:53,935 --> 01:15:56,495
Gill!
Don't let me go belly-up!

1519
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,870
Just calm down, Nemo.
You won't go belly-up.

1520
01:15:58,905 --> 01:16:01,280
I promise.
You're gonna be OK.

1521
01:16:04,202 --> 01:16:06,292
Darla!

1522
01:16:09,712 --> 01:16:12,568
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

1523
01:16:12,603 --> 01:16:15,423
No, but the boat
has to be here somewhere.

1524
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:17,926
Come on, Dory.
We're gonna find it.

1525
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,394
I'm totally excited.
Are you excited?

1526
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:22,184
Dory, wake up.
Wake up, come on.

1527
01:16:22,219 --> 01:16:24,031
Duck!

1528
01:16:24,066 --> 01:16:27,485
That's not a duck.
It's a... pelican!

1529
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,945
- Whoa!
- Aah!

1530
01:16:35,577 --> 01:16:36,752
- Whoa!
- Aah!

1531
01:16:36,787 --> 01:16:40,078
No! I didn't come this far
to be breakfast!

1532
01:16:47,589 --> 01:16:50,090
Hey, Nigel.
Would you look at that?

1533
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:51,435
What? What?

1534
01:16:51,471 --> 01:16:54,391
Sun's barely up and Gerald's
had more than he can handle.

1535
01:16:54,426 --> 01:16:57,061
Yeah. Reckon somebody
ought to help the poor guy.

1536
01:16:57,096 --> 01:16:59,066
Yeah, right. Yeah.

1537
01:16:59,101 --> 01:17:02,772
Don't everybody
fly off at once.

1538
01:17:05,823 --> 01:17:08,823
All right, Gerald.
Fish got your tongue?

1539
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:11,954
- Aah!
- Love a duck!

1540
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:14,327
I gotta find my son Nemo!

1541
01:17:14,361 --> 01:17:16,630
Nemo? He's that fish!

1542
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:19,295
The one that's been fighting
the whole ocean!

1543
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:21,796
I know where your son-Huh?

1544
01:17:23,386 --> 01:17:25,101
Wait! Come back! Stop!

1545
01:17:25,136 --> 01:17:27,157
Dory, keep going!
He's crazy!

1546
01:17:27,192 --> 01:17:29,176
I got something to tell you!

1547
01:17:33,477 --> 01:17:35,018
Mine.

1548
01:17:39,068 --> 01:17:42,625
Don't make any sudden moves.

1549
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:46,915
Hop inside my mouth
if you want to live.

1550
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:50,621
Hop in your mouth?
How does that make me live?

1551
01:17:50,656 --> 01:17:51,796
Mine?

1552
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:55,502
Because
I can take you to your son.

1553
01:17:55,536 --> 01:17:58,229
- Yeah, right.
- No. I know your son.

1554
01:17:58,264 --> 01:18:00,922
He's orange with
a gimpy fin on one side.

1555
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:02,901
- That's Nemo!
- Aah!

1556
01:18:02,935 --> 01:18:04,843
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1557
01:18:04,878 --> 01:18:06,318
Aah!

1558
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:08,854
Fasten your seat belts!

1559
01:18:09,974 --> 01:18:12,144
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1560
01:18:12,195 --> 01:18:14,300
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1561
01:18:14,335 --> 01:18:17,186
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

1562
01:18:17,221 --> 01:18:20,035
Ha ha ha ha!

1563
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:23,206
Aah!

1564
01:18:30,548 --> 01:18:32,758
Everybody hold on!

1565
01:18:32,793 --> 01:18:34,549
- Aah!
- Aah!

1566
01:18:36,089 --> 01:18:38,639
Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1567
01:18:44,731 --> 01:18:47,191
Too loud!
Too loud for me!

1568
01:18:47,226 --> 01:18:49,616
Twinkle, twinkle,
little star

1569
01:18:49,651 --> 01:18:52,382
Find a happy place!
Find a happy place!

1570
01:18:52,417 --> 01:18:55,112
Darla, your uncle
will see you now.

1571
01:18:57,123 --> 01:19:00,584
All right, let's see
those pearly whites.

1572
01:19:00,618 --> 01:19:04,061
Raah! I'm a piranha.
They're in the Amazon.

1573
01:19:04,096 --> 01:19:07,505
And a piranha's a fish,
just like your present.

1574
01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:10,600
I get fishy, fishy

1575
01:19:10,635 --> 01:19:13,136
Oh, no.
Poor little guy.

1576
01:19:13,171 --> 01:19:15,028
- He's dead.
- Sharkbait!

1577
01:19:15,063 --> 01:19:16,850
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

1578
01:19:16,886 --> 01:19:18,517
Must've left your present
in the car, sweetie.

1579
01:19:18,552 --> 01:19:20,822
- Ohh!
- I'll go and get it.

1580
01:19:20,857 --> 01:19:22,572
- He's still alive!
- He's not dead!

1581
01:19:22,608 --> 01:19:24,608
What's happening?
Why is he playing dead?

1582
01:19:24,643 --> 01:19:26,573
He's gonna get flushed
down the toilet.

1583
01:19:26,608 --> 01:19:29,028
- He's gonna get out of here!
- He's gonna get flushed!

1584
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:30,794
What a smart little guy!

1585
01:19:30,829 --> 01:19:32,450
Oh, no!
Not the trash can!

1586
01:19:32,484 --> 01:19:33,754
Nemo! No!

1587
01:19:33,789 --> 01:19:37,210
- Hey! I found his dad!
- Where's Nemo?

1588
01:19:37,245 --> 01:19:38,585
- Dentist!
- He's over there!

1589
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:42,016
What's a dentist?
Nigel, get in there!

1590
01:19:42,051 --> 01:19:46,052
- I can't go in there!
- Yes, you can! Charge!

1591
01:19:47,473 --> 01:19:49,052
- Aah!
- What the-?

1592
01:19:50,303 --> 01:19:52,934
Darla, sweetie, look out!

1593
01:19:56,314 --> 01:19:58,399
- Aah!
- Hold still!

1594
01:19:58,435 --> 01:20:00,484
- Aah!
- Easy! Easy!

1595
01:20:01,734 --> 01:20:02,949
- Aah!
- Hold still!

1596
01:20:02,985 --> 01:20:06,195
Nobody's going to hurt you!
Oof!

1597
01:20:12,246 --> 01:20:14,632
Nemo.

1598
01:20:14,668 --> 01:20:16,292
Oh, my goodness.

1599
01:20:16,328 --> 01:20:17,917
Gotcha! Keep down!

1600
01:20:17,952 --> 01:20:19,218
Nemo!

1601
01:20:19,253 --> 01:20:20,973
Daddy?

1602
01:20:21,008 --> 01:20:24,888
Out with you!
And stay out!

1603
01:20:24,924 --> 01:20:26,301
Daddy?

1604
01:20:26,336 --> 01:20:27,644
Fishy?

1605
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,850
Fishy! Wake up!

1606
01:20:29,885 --> 01:20:31,985
Oh, no!

1607
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,610
To the top of
Mount Wannahockaloogie!

1608
01:20:34,645 --> 01:20:37,071
Why are you sleeping?

1609
01:20:37,107 --> 01:20:39,532
- Hurry!
- Bloat!

1610
01:20:42,532 --> 01:20:44,702
Ring of Fire!

1611
01:20:45,662 --> 01:20:49,253
Fishy! Aah!

1612
01:20:50,714 --> 01:20:52,793
Crikey! All the animals
have gone mad!

1613
01:20:52,828 --> 01:20:54,509
Unh!

1614
01:20:54,545 --> 01:20:57,140
Aaah! Get it out!

1615
01:20:57,176 --> 01:20:59,764
- Smack her in the head!
- Go, Gill, go!

1616
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,806
Fish in my hair!

1617
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,191
Gill!

1618
01:21:03,226 --> 01:21:07,727
Sharkbait...
tell your dad I said hi.

1619
01:21:07,761 --> 01:21:09,276
- Unh!
- Eww!

1620
01:21:12,738 --> 01:21:14,068
Go get 'em!

1621
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:16,448
Ohh...

1622
01:21:19,038 --> 01:21:20,754
- He did it!
- Yay!

1623
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:23,414
- I'm so happy!
- Is he gonna be OK, Gill?

1624
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:26,040
Don't worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.

1625
01:21:26,076 --> 01:21:27,801
Fishy!

1626
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:32,646
Aah!

1627
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,301
Aah! Whoa! Whoa!

1628
01:21:35,336 --> 01:21:37,682
Daddy!

1629
01:22:13,478 --> 01:22:16,349
I'm so sorry.

1630
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:19,820
Truly, I am.

1631
01:22:37,132 --> 01:22:39,308
- Hey.
- Dory...

1632
01:22:39,343 --> 01:22:41,428
if it wasn't for you...

1633
01:22:41,463 --> 01:22:44,304
I never would've even
made it here.

1634
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:46,345
So, thank you.

1635
01:22:48,395 --> 01:22:50,151
Hey, wait a minute.

1636
01:22:50,185 --> 01:22:52,741
Wait. Where are you going?

1637
01:22:52,776 --> 01:22:56,986
It's over, Dory.
We were too late.

1638
01:22:57,022 --> 01:23:01,197
Nemo's gone,
and I'm going home now.

1639
01:23:01,232 --> 01:23:03,698
No. No, you can't.

1640
01:23:05,538 --> 01:23:07,328
Stop!

1641
01:23:08,878 --> 01:23:10,709
Please don't go away.

1642
01:23:10,744 --> 01:23:12,634
Please?

1643
01:23:12,669 --> 01:23:15,470
No one's ever stuck with me
for so long before.

1644
01:23:15,505 --> 01:23:19,016
And if you leave, I just...

1645
01:23:19,051 --> 01:23:21,556
I remember things
better with you.

1646
01:23:21,591 --> 01:23:24,062
I do. Look-
P. Sherman, 42...

1647
01:23:24,097 --> 01:23:27,027
42...

1648
01:23:27,062 --> 01:23:29,818
I remember it.
I do. It's there.

1649
01:23:29,853 --> 01:23:31,983
I know it is because
when I look at you...

1650
01:23:32,017 --> 01:23:33,408
I can feel it.

1651
01:23:33,443 --> 01:23:39,285
I look at you
and I... I'm home.

1652
01:23:41,075 --> 01:23:42,710
Please...

1653
01:23:42,745 --> 01:23:45,415
I don't want that to go away.

1654
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:47,796
I don't want to forget.

1655
01:23:49,087 --> 01:23:53,217
I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.

1656
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:07,779
- Manna from heaven.
- Sweet nectar of life!

1657
01:24:07,814 --> 01:24:09,824
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1658
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:13,320
- This is our spot!
- Get outta here!

1659
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:16,741
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1660
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:18,257
Yeah, that's it, fella.

1661
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:19,961
Just keep on swimmin'.
You got that.

1662
01:24:19,996 --> 01:24:22,007
Too right, mate!

1663
01:24:22,043 --> 01:24:23,382
Oh! I got a live one here!

1664
01:24:23,417 --> 01:24:24,807
Have you seen my dad?

1665
01:24:24,842 --> 01:24:27,132
Gotcha! Hey! Hey!
Come back here!

1666
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:29,006
You let him go!

1667
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,172
Hey! Hey!

1668
01:24:32,206 --> 01:24:35,304
Dad! Dad!

1669
01:24:35,339 --> 01:24:36,975
Dad!

1670
01:24:47,907 --> 01:24:50,292
Ohh!

1671
01:24:50,327 --> 01:24:52,517
Um, excuse me.

1672
01:24:52,552 --> 01:24:54,673
Are you all right?

1673
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:57,378
I don't know where I am.
I don't know what's going on.

1674
01:24:57,414 --> 01:25:00,921
I think I lost somebody,
but I can't remember.

1675
01:25:00,956 --> 01:25:04,430
It's OK.
I'm looking for someone, too.

1676
01:25:04,465 --> 01:25:06,889
Hey, we can look together.

1677
01:25:06,925 --> 01:25:08,703
I'm Dory.

1678
01:25:08,738 --> 01:25:10,445
I'm Nemo.

1679
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,902
Nemo? That's a nice name.

1680
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:25,708
- Dad!
- Dad!

1681
01:25:25,743 --> 01:25:27,874
Wait a minute.
Is it your dad or my dad?

1682
01:25:27,909 --> 01:25:30,340
- My dad.
- Got it. Dad!

1683
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,664
- Where are we, anyway?
- Dad! Dad!

1684
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:36,551
Oh. Syl-Shi-Sydney.

1685
01:25:36,586 --> 01:25:40,886
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1686
01:25:40,921 --> 01:25:42,691
Aah! Nemo!

1687
01:25:42,728 --> 01:25:45,096
It's you! Aah!
You're Nemo!

1688
01:25:46,807 --> 01:25:49,438
You're Nemo!
You were dead. I saw you.

1689
01:25:49,473 --> 01:25:51,364
And here you are!
I found you.

1690
01:25:51,399 --> 01:25:54,149
You're not dead.
And your father-Your father!

1691
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:56,796
You know my father?!
Where is he?

1692
01:25:56,832 --> 01:25:59,410
This way!
He went this way. Quick!

1693
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:00,867
Hey, hey, hey!

1694
01:26:00,903 --> 01:26:02,255
Hey! Hey!

1695
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:04,271
Have you seen
an orange fish swim by?

1696
01:26:04,305 --> 01:26:06,251
- It looks just like him!
- But bigger!

1697
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:07,466
Yeah, I saw him, bluey.

1698
01:26:07,501 --> 01:26:11,047
But I'm not tellin' you
where he went...

1699
01:26:11,081 --> 01:26:14,593
and there's no way
you're gonna make me.

1700
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:15,763
Mine.

1701
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:18,559
Aah!
All right! I'll talk!

1702
01:26:18,594 --> 01:26:23,354
He went to
the fishing grounds! Aah!

1703
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:27,200
Hey, look out!

1704
01:26:27,235 --> 01:26:29,776
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get home.

1705
01:26:30,776 --> 01:26:34,535
Dad! Dad!

1706
01:26:34,571 --> 01:26:35,921
Nemo?

1707
01:26:35,956 --> 01:26:38,122
- Daddy!
- Nemo?

1708
01:26:38,157 --> 01:26:40,497
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

1709
01:26:40,533 --> 01:26:42,547
Dory? Nemo!

1710
01:26:42,582 --> 01:26:43,763
Daddy!

1711
01:26:43,797 --> 01:26:46,094
Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!

1712
01:26:46,128 --> 01:26:49,763
- Dad!
- Nemo! Thank goodness.

1713
01:26:49,798 --> 01:26:52,775
It's all right, son.
It's gonna be OK.

1714
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:55,680
Turn around!
You're going the wrong way!

1715
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:00,186
Aah! Look out!

1716
01:27:00,221 --> 01:27:02,230
Oh, my-

1717
01:27:18,924 --> 01:27:21,550
Help! He-e-elp!

1718
01:27:21,586 --> 01:27:23,590
- Dory!
- Come on!

1719
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:25,560
Help! Help!

1720
01:27:25,595 --> 01:27:28,346
Help! Get us out! Aah!

1721
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:30,151
No, no, no! Dory!

1722
01:27:30,187 --> 01:27:33,192
- Dad, I know what to do!
- Nemo! No!

1723
01:27:33,226 --> 01:27:36,027
We have to tell all the fish
to swim down together!

1724
01:27:36,062 --> 01:27:38,737
- Get out of there now!
- I know this will work!

1725
01:27:38,773 --> 01:27:40,662
No, I am not
gonna lose you again!

1726
01:27:40,698 --> 01:27:44,198
There's no time!
It's the only way to save Dory!

1727
01:27:45,449 --> 01:27:46,949
I can do this.

1728
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,105
You're right.

1729
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:52,095
I know you can.

1730
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:55,006
- Lucky fin!
- Now, go! Hurry!

1731
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:58,171
Tell all the fish to swim down!

1732
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:01,302
Well? You heard my son!
Come on!

1733
01:28:02,763 --> 01:28:05,432
Dory, you have
to tell everybody to...

1734
01:28:05,467 --> 01:28:06,979
Swim down together!

1735
01:28:07,013 --> 01:28:09,313
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

1736
01:28:09,348 --> 01:28:11,604
Swim down!

1737
01:28:15,904 --> 01:28:17,159
Everybody swim down!

1738
01:28:17,194 --> 01:28:19,745
Come on,
you have to swim down!

1739
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:22,496
Down! Swim down!

1740
01:28:24,575 --> 01:28:28,247
Swim down! Swim down!

1741
01:28:35,929 --> 01:28:38,348
Don't give up!
Keep swimming!

1742
01:28:38,383 --> 01:28:40,808
Just keep swimming!

1743
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:46,691
That's it!

1744
01:28:49,611 --> 01:28:51,611
It's working!

1745
01:28:54,032 --> 01:28:57,087
Keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1746
01:28:57,122 --> 01:28:59,293
Just keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1747
01:28:59,328 --> 01:29:00,758
Come on, Dad!

1748
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:03,213
- You're doing great, son!
- That's my dad.

1749
01:29:03,248 --> 01:29:05,730
Let's get to the bottom!
Keep swimming!

1750
01:29:05,765 --> 01:29:08,214
Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming

1751
01:29:08,249 --> 01:29:10,465
Almost there!
Keep swimming!

1752
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:15,345
Keep swimming!

1753
01:29:17,646 --> 01:29:18,817
Keep swimming!

1754
01:29:29,158 --> 01:29:30,624
- Oof!
- Hey!

1755
01:29:30,658 --> 01:29:34,328
- Dory! Where's Nemo?
- There!

1756
01:29:35,998 --> 01:29:39,090
Oh, no. Nemo!

1757
01:29:45,011 --> 01:29:46,930
Nemo?

1758
01:29:48,552 --> 01:29:50,857
Nemo?

1759
01:29:50,892 --> 01:29:54,933
It's OK. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.

1760
01:29:59,363 --> 01:30:00,488
Daddy?

1761
01:30:00,523 --> 01:30:03,193
Oh, thank goodness.

1762
01:30:03,229 --> 01:30:05,865
Dad... I don't hate you.

1763
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,157
Oh, no, no, no.

1764
01:30:08,192 --> 01:30:10,416
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

1765
01:30:19,637 --> 01:30:22,848
- Hey, guess what?
- What?

1766
01:30:22,883 --> 01:30:26,595
Sea turtles-I met one.

1767
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:30,309
And he was 150 years old.

1768
01:30:30,344 --> 01:30:34,494
-150?
- Yep.

1769
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:39,411
Sandy Plankton said
they only live to be 100.

1770
01:30:39,446 --> 01:30:40,957
Sandy Plankton?

1771
01:30:40,991 --> 01:30:43,031
Do you think I would
cross the entire ocean...

1772
01:30:43,066 --> 01:30:45,162
and not know as much
as Sandy Plankton?

1773
01:30:45,197 --> 01:30:47,837
- Ha ha ha!
- He was 150! Not 100!

1774
01:30:47,873 --> 01:30:51,793
Who is this Sandy Plankton
who knows everything?

1775
01:30:53,424 --> 01:30:57,053
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1776
01:30:57,094 --> 01:31:00,555
- I'm gonna win!
- No, you're not!

1777
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:04,015
- I did it!
- Aw, my own son beats me!

1778
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:06,490
Climb aboard, explorers.

1779
01:31:06,526 --> 01:31:09,697
The sea cucumber looks over
to the mollusk and says...

1780
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:12,617
With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?

1781
01:31:14,277 --> 01:31:16,538
Hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1782
01:31:16,618 --> 01:31:20,077
- Exchange student.
- I'm from the E.A.C., dude!

1783
01:31:20,118 --> 01:31:22,789
- Sweet!
- Totally.

1784
01:31:24,789 --> 01:31:26,800
Did you really do all
the things you say you did?

1785
01:31:26,834 --> 01:31:29,047
Pardon me.

1786
01:31:29,082 --> 01:31:31,026
- Hello.
- Ohh.

1787
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,936
Don't be alarmed.

1788
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:36,760
We wanted to make sure our
newest member got home safely.

1789
01:31:36,795 --> 01:31:39,106
- Thanks, guys.
- See you next week.

1790
01:31:39,141 --> 01:31:42,603
- Keep up with the program.
- Remember, fish are friends...

1791
01:31:42,653 --> 01:31:44,987
Not food! Bye!

1792
01:31:45,022 --> 01:31:46,838
Hold on, here we go!

1793
01:31:46,874 --> 01:31:49,038
Next stop-knowledge!

1794
01:31:49,073 --> 01:31:50,784
Bye, son! Have fun!

1795
01:31:50,819 --> 01:31:52,459
Bye, Dad!

1796
01:31:52,494 --> 01:31:55,994
Oh! Mr. Ray, wait.
I forgot something.

1797
01:32:00,625 --> 01:32:03,261
Love you, Dad.

1798
01:32:03,296 --> 01:32:05,296
I love you, too, son.

1799
01:32:07,557 --> 01:32:11,162
Dad? You can let go now.

1800
01:32:11,196 --> 01:32:14,109
Sorry. Go have an adventure.

1801
01:32:14,143 --> 01:32:17,019
Good-bye!
See ya later, dudes!

1802
01:32:17,108 --> 01:32:19,534
- Bye, Elmo!
- Nemo.

1803
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:23,069
- Bye, Nemo!
- See you after school, Dory!

1804
01:32:23,104 --> 01:32:25,612
Bye, Dad!

1805
01:32:25,647 --> 01:32:28,120
Bye, son.
